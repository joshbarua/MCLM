This rule depends only on the relative order of the 200 cards and satisfies the given conditions.\n\nTo see why this rule works:\n- Condition 1 is satisfied because the rule depends only on the relative order of the cards.\n- Condition 2 is satisfied because if \\(a_i > b_i\\) for all \\(i\\), then the smallest element in \\(A\\) is greater than the largest element in \\(B\\), meaning \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\).\n- Condition 3 is satisfied because if \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\) and \\(B\\) beats \\(C\\), then the largest element in \\(B\\) is less than the smallest element in \\(A\\) and the largest element in \\(C\\) is less than the smallest element in \\(B\\), so the largest element in \\(C\\) is less than the smallest element in \\(A\\), meaning \\(A\\) beats \\(C\\).\n\n### Step 3: Counting the Number of Ways to Define the Rule\nThe rule we defined is unique up to a constant shift. That is, if we define \\(A\\) beats \\(B\\) if the largest element in \\(B\\) is less than the smallest element in \\(A\\), then any constant shift of this rule will still satisfy all the conditions.

Let's denote the numbers as \\(WAE\\) and \\(ASH\\), where \\(WAE\\) and \\(ASH\\) are four-digit and three-digit numbers, respectively. The equation can be written as:\n\n\\[1000W + 100A + 10D + E + 100A + 10S + H = 2030\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[1000W + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(D + E\\), we should try to maximize the contribution of \\(W\\) and \\(A\\) while ensuring that all digits are distinct and the equation holds. Let's start by trying the largest possible value for \\(W\\), which is 2 (since \\(W\\) is a digit and the largest possible value is 2).\n\nIf \\(W = 2\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[2000 + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030\\]\n\nSubtracting 2000 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nSince \\(A\\), \\(D\\), \\(E\\), \\(S\\), and \\(H\\) are digits (0-9), let's try to maximize \\(A\\). The largest possible value for \\(A\\) is 1 (since \\(A\\) must be a digit and the equation must hold).\n\nIf \\(A = 1\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[200(1) + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[200 + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nSubtracting 200 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[10D + E + 10S + H = -170\\]\n\nThis is not possible since the left side is non-negative. Therefore, \\(A\\) cannot be 1. Let's try \\(A = 0\\).\n\nIf \\(A = 0\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[200(0) + 10D + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[10D + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(D + E\\), we should try to maximize \\(D\\) and \\(E\\).

However, this would mean that \\(E\\), \\(S\\), and \\(H\\) are not distinct. Therefore, \\(D\\) cannot be 3.\n\nLet's try the next largest possible value for \\(D\\), which is 2.\n\nIf \\(D = 2\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[10(2) + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[20 + E + 10S + H = 30\\]\n\nSubtracting 20 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[E + 10S + H = 10\\]\n\nTo maximize \\(E\\), we should try to maximize \\(E\\). Let's try the largest possible value for \\(E\\), which is 10 (since \\(E\\) must be a digit).\n\nIf \\(E = 10\\), the equation becomes:\n\n\\[10S + H = 0\\]\n\nSince \\(S\\) and \\(H\\) are digits and must be non-negative, the only solution is \\(S = 0\\) and \\(H = 0\\).
