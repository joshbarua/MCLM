We need to find the maximum possible number of distinct convex polygons that can be formed by choosing any two vertices of \\( P \\).\n\n2. **Properties of a Convex Polygon**: A convex polygon is a polygon where all interior angles are less than 180 degrees. Since each interior angle of \\( P \\) is an even number, and the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \\( n \\) sides is \\( (n-2) \\times 180 \\) degrees, each interior angle being even implies that the sum of these angles must also be even. This is always true for any polygon, so the condition does not impose any additional restrictions on the polygon itself beyond the fact that all interior angles are even.\n\n3. **Counting the Number of Distinct Convex Polygons**: To form a convex polygon by choosing any two vertices of \\( P \\), we need to choose 3 or more vertices from the 2003 vertices of \\( P \\) to form a convex polygon.

Each vector from 1 to \\( n \\) must be a consecutive run of integers.\n2. Each vector from \\( n+1 \\) to \\( 2n \\) must also be a consecutive run of integers.\n3. The vectors from 1 to \\( n \\) and from \\( n+1 \\) to \\( 2n \\) must be disjoint.\n4. The total number of integers \\( k \\) is \\( k \\geq n \\geq 1 \\).\n5. The difference \\( k - n \\) is an integer.\n\nGiven these conditions, we need to find the number of ways to arrange these vectors. Let's denote the vectors as follows:\n- Vector A: \\( (1, 2, \\ldots, n) \\)\n- Vector B: \\( (n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2n) \\)\n\nWe need to arrange these vectors such that they form consecutive runs and are disjoint. The total number of positions is \\( k \\), and we need to choose \\( n \\) positions out of \\( k \\) for Vector A. The remaining \\( k - n \\) positions will automatically be for Vector B.\n\nThe number of ways to choose \\( n \\) positions out of \\( k \\) is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{k}{n} \\).\n\nNow, we need to consider the constraints on \\( k \\). Since \\( k \\geq n \\) and \\( k - n \\) is an integer, \\( k \\) must be at least \\( n \\). Therefore, the smallest possible value for \\( k \\) is \\( n \\).\n\nTo find the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\), we need to compare the number of ways to arrange the vectors for different values of \\( k \\). However, the problem does not specify the exact values of \\( N \\) and \\( M \\), but rather asks for the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\).\n\nGiven the constraints and the nature of the problem, we can infer that the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) is independent of the specific values of \\( N \\) and \\( M \\) and depends only on the number of vectors and the positions they can occupy.\n\nThe ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) can be determined by considering the combinatorial nature of the problem. Since the vectors are disjoint and must be consecutive runs, the ratio is essentially the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) vectors in \\( k \\) positions divided by the number of ways to arrange \\( n \\) vectors in \\( k \\) positions, which is simply 1.\n\nTherefore, the ratio \\( \\frac{N}{M} \\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]","answer":"2^{k-n}","scores":-2.234375}

We need to find the longest possible sequence of consecutive pieces such that each of the 2013 white squares and each of the 2014 black squares appears exactly once.\n\n3. **Constructing a Sequence:**\n   Let's construct a sequence that satisfies the given conditions. Consider a sequence of 4027 pieces of paper where the first 2013 pieces are white and the remaining 2014 pieces are black. This sequence can be represented as:\n   \\[\n   W_1, W_2, \\ldots, W_{2013}, B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{2014}\n   \\]\n   where \\( W_i \\) represents a white square and \\( B_i \\) represents a black square.\n\n4. **Identifying the Sequence:**\n   In this sequence, we can see that each white square \\( W_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2013 \\) and each black square \\( B_i \\) for \\( i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2014 \\) appears exactly once.\n\n5. **Generalizing the Sequence:**\n   To generalize this, consider a sequence of 4027 pieces of paper where the first 2013 pieces are white and the remaining 2014 pieces are black. This sequence can be shifted cyclically to generate other valid sequences. For example, if we shift the sequence by one position to the right, we get:\n   \\[\n   B_1, B_2, \\ldots, B_{2014}, W_1, W_2, \\ldots, W_{2013}\n   \\]\n   In this sequence, each white square and each black square still appears exactly once.\n\n6. **Conclusion:**\n   By shifting the sequence cyclically, we can generate multiple sequences of consecutive pieces of paper. Each sequence will still satisfy the condition that each white square and each black square appears exactly once. Therefore, the longest possible sequence of consecutive pieces of paper that satisfies the given conditions is 2013 pieces.\n\nThe final answer is \\( \\boxed{2013} \\)","answer":"2013","scores":2.40625}

Notice that for any integer \\(n\\), \\(P(n) = n^2 + n + 1\\) is a quadratic function, and its values will be distinct for distinct integer inputs.

Therefore, we need to find the smallest \\(a\\) such that the set \\(\\{a+1, a+2, \\ldots, a+b\\}\\) contains exactly 100 integers.

Let's verify this:\n\nFor \\(a = 1\\) and \\(b = 100\\), the set is \\(\\{P(2), P(3), \\ldots, P(101)\\}\\). Since \\(P(n)\\) is a quadratic function and takes distinct values for distinct integer inputs, the values \\(P(2), P(3), \\ldots, P(101)\\) will all be distinct. Therefore, the set contains exactly 100 distinct values.\n\nThus, the smallest possible value for \\(a\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).","answer":"6","scores":-2.65625}

Expanding and simplifying further:\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x + n^2 - y^2 + n = 8n\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   x^2 + x + n^2 - y^2 = 7n\n   \\]\n\n9.

We start by analyzing the gcd for small values of \\( n \\).\n\nFirst, let's consider \\( n = 1 \\):\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^1 + b, b^1 + a) = \\gcd(a + b, b + a) = \\gcd(a + b, a + b) = a + b.\n\\]\nThis means that for \\( n = 1 \\), the gcd is \\( a + b \\), not necessarily \\( g \\).\n\nNext, let's consider \\( n = 2 \\):\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^2 + b, b^2 + a).\n\\]\nWe need to find a relationship between \\( a^2 + b \\) and \\( b^2 + a \\). Let's denote \\( d = \\gcd(a^2 + b, b^2 + a) \\). Then \\( d \\) must divide any linear combination of \\( a^2 + b \\) and \\( b^2 + a \\). Consider the expression:\n\\[\na(a^2 + b) - b(b^2 + a) = a^3 + ab - b^3 - ab = a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2).\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide \\( (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \\). Similarly, we can consider:\n\\[\nb(b^2 + a) - a(a^2 + b) = b^3 + ab - a^3 - ab = b^3 - a^3 = (b - a)(a^2 + ab + b^2).\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide \\( (b - a)(a^2 + ab + b^2) \\). Since \\( d \\) divides both, it must divide the gcd of these two expressions, which is \\( a^2 + ab + b^2 \\). Therefore, \\( d \\) must divide \\( a^2 + ab + b^2 \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the case when \\( n = 3 \\):\n\\[\n\\gcd(a^3 + b, b^3 + a).\n\\]\nWe need to find a relationship between \\( a^3 + b \\) and \\( b^3 + a \\). Let's denote \\( d = \\gcd(a^3 + b, b^3 + a) \\). Then \\( d \\) must divide any linear combination of \\( a^3 + b \\) and \\( b^3 + a \\). Consider the expression:\n\\[\na(a^3 + b) - b(b^3 + a) = a^4 + ab - b^4 - ab = a^4 - b^4 = (a^2 - b^2)(a^2 + b^2) = (a - b)(a + b)(a^2 + b^2).\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide \\( (a - b)(a + b)(a^2 + b^2) \\). Similarly, we can consider:\n\\[\nb(b^3 + a) - a(b^3 + a) = b^4 + ab - a^4 - ab = b^4 - a^4 = (b^2 - a^2)(b^2 + a^2) = (b - a)(a^2 + b^2).\n\\]\nThus, \\( d \\) must divide \\( (b - a)(a^2 + b^2) \\). Since \\( d \\) divides both, it must divide the gcd of these two expressions, which is \\( a^2 + b^2 \\).

To ensure that the gcd is \\( g \\) for all \\( n \\ge N \\), we need to find the smallest \\( N \\) such that the gcd is consistent for all \\( n \\ge N \\). By the properties of gcd and the structure of the expressions, we can see that the gcd will be consistent for \\( n \\ge 3 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest \\( N \\) is \\( 3 \\).
