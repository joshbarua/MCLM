The initial order of contestants is some permutation of \\(C_1, C_2, \\ldots, C_n\\).\n2. Every minute, the jury chooses an integer \\(i\\) with \\(1 \\leq i \\leq n\\).\n3.

If contestant \\(C_i\\) has fewer than \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, the restaurant opens and the process ends.\n\nThe key insight is to maximize the number of times contestants move forward. This happens when \\(C_i\\) has at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of her, which means \\(C_i\\) is in one of the first \\(n-i+1\\) positions in the queue.\n\nTo maximize the number of euros collected, we should arrange the contestants in such a way that as many contestants as possible have at least \\(i\\) other contestants in front of them for as long as possible. The optimal arrangement is to place the contestants in reverse order, i.e., \\(C_n, C_{n-1}, \\ldots, C_1\\).\n\nLet's analyze this arrangement:\n- Initially, \\(C_n\\) is in the last position and has \\(n-1\\) contestants in front of her. She can move forward every minute until \\(i = n-1\\), which takes \\(1\\) minute, and she moves to the first position.\n- Now, \\(C_{n-1}\\) is in the first position and has \\(0\\) contestants in front of her. She cannot move forward and the process ends.\n\nHowever, this is not the optimal strategy because we can continue moving forward in subsequent rounds. Let's consider a different approach.\n\nThe optimal strategy is to place the contestants in a way that maximizes the number of times contestants can move forward. One such strategy is to place the contestants in a cyclic pattern, where each contestant moves forward one position every minute until the last contestant in the cycle moves to the first position, and then the cycle repeats.\n\nFor example, if \\(n = 4\\), the initial order could be \\(C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4\\). Here's the process:\n- \\(C_1\\) moves forward 1 position.\n- \\(C_2\\) moves forward 2 positions.\n- \\(C_3\\) moves forward 3 positions.\n- \\(C_4\\) moves forward 4 positions and ends up in the first position, so the process ends.\n\nThe total number of euros collected is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\) for \\(n = 4\\).\n\nFor general \\(n\\), the total number of euros collected is the sum of the first \\(n\\) positive integers, which is given by the formula:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum number of euros that the jury can collect is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}}\\).","answer":"$2^{n}-n-1$","scores":0.8359375}
