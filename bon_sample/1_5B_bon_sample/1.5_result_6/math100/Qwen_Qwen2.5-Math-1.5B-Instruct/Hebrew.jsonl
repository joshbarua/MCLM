Therefore, the expression simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n(\\sin 20^\\circ \\sin 40^\\circ \\sin 60^\\circ \\sin 80^\\circ)^2\n\\]\n\nNext, we use the identity \\(\\sin x = \\cos (90^\\circ - x)\\) to rewrite the product in terms of cosine:\n\n\\[\n\\sin 20^\\circ \\sin 40^\\circ \\sin 60^\\circ \\sin 80^\\circ = \\cos 70^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ \\cos 10^\\circ\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\cos 30^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\), so we can substitute this value in:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 70^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ \\cos 30^\\circ \\cos 10^\\circ = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cos 70^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ \\cos 10^\\circ\n\\]\n\nNow, we use the product-to-sum identities to simplify \\(\\cos 70^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ \\cos 10^\\circ\\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the product of cosines:\n\n\\[\n\\cos 10^\\circ \\cos 50^\\circ \\cos 70^\\circ = \\frac{\\sin 10^\\circ}{8 \\sin 1^\\circ}\n\\]\n\nThis identity can be derived using the product-to-sum identities and the double-angle formula.

Thus, \\(\\sin \\alpha = 0.4\\) and \\(\\sin \\beta = 0.5\\).\n\nFirst, we need to find \\(\\cos \\alpha\\) and \\(\\cos \\beta\\).
