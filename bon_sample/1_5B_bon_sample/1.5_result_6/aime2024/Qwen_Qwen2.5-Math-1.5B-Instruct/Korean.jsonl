Therefore, there are \\(2^6 = 64\\) possible ways to color the vertices of the hexagon.\n\nWhen the hexagon is translated, each vertex of the original hexagon is mapped to a corresponding vertex of the translated hexagon. For the translated hexagon to have the same color pattern as the original hexagon, each vertex in the original hexagon must have the same color as its corresponding vertex in the translated hexagon. This means that the translation must map each vertex to itself, which implies that the translation vector must be a multiple of the hexagon's symmetry.\n\nThe hexagon has rotational symmetries. Specifically, the hexagon can be rotated by 0\u00b0, 60\u00b0, 120\u00b0, 180\u00b0, 240\u00b0, or 300\u00b0, which are the same as the rotations by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times 60\u00b0. However, the only rotation that maps each vertex to itself is the 0\u00b0 rotation (the identity rotation). Therefore, the only way for the translated hexagon to have the same color pattern as the original hexagon is if the hexagon is not translated at all.\n\nSince there is only 1 identity rotation out of the 6 possible rotations, the probability that the translated hexagon has the same color pattern as the original hexagon is \\(\\frac{1}{6}\\).\n\nThus, the probability is \\(\\frac{m}{n} = \\frac{1}{6}\\), where \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 6\\).

In each round, a player removes either 1 or 4 tiles. The game continues until there is only one tile left, and that player wins. We need to determine the smallest number of tiles \\( n \\) such that the first player can always win if \\( n = 2024 \\).\n\nTo solve this, we need to understand the strategy of the game. The key is to determine the losing positions. A losing position is a number of tiles \\( n \\) such that the player whose turn it is to move will lose if the opponent plays optimally. If a player is faced with a losing position, any move they make will leave the opponent in a winning position.\n\nLet's define a losing position as \\( n \\). If a player is faced with \\( n \\) tiles, they can remove either 1 or 4 tiles. If they remove 1 tile, they leave \\( n-1 \\) tiles. If they remove 4 tiles, they leave \\( n-4 \\) tiles. For the player to lose, both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-4 \\) must be winning positions. Therefore, \\( n \\) is a losing position if and only if both \\( n-1 \\) and \\( n-4 \\) are winning positions.\n\nWe can use this to find the pattern of losing and winning positions. Let's start with the smallest numbers:\n- \\( n = 1 \\) is a losing position because if the first player removes the only tile, they win.\n- \\( n = 2 \\) is a winning position because the first player can remove 1 tile, leaving the second player with 1 tile, which is a losing position.\n- \\( n = 3 \\) is a winning position because the first player can remove 1 tile, leaving the second player with 2 tiles, which is a winning position.\n- \\( n = 4 \\) is a losing position because if the first player removes 4 tiles, they win, and if they remove 1 tile, they leave the second player with 3 tiles, which is a winning position.\n- \\( n = 5 \\) is a winning position because the first player can remove 1 tile, leaving the second player with 4 tiles, which is a losing position.\n- \\( n = 6 \\) is a winning position because the first player can remove 1 tile, leaving the second player with 5 tiles, which is a winning position.\n- \\( n = 7 \\) is a winning position because the first player can remove 4 tiles, leaving the second player with 3 tiles, which is a winning position.\n- \\( n = 8 \\) is a losing position because if the first player removes 4 tiles, they win, and if they remove 1 tile, they leave the second player with 7 tiles, which is a winning position.\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that the losing positions are \\( n = 1, 3, 8, 12, 15, 19, \\ldots \\). These numbers can be described by the recurrence relation \\( n_k = 3k + 1 \\) or \\( n_k = 3k + 2 \\), where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer. The first few losing positions are 1, 3, 8, 12, 15, 19, etc.\n\nTo find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the first player can always win if \\( n = 2024 \\), we need to check if 2024 is a losing position. Since 2024 is not in the form of \\( 3k + 1 \\) or \\( 3k + 2 \\), it is a winning position. Therefore, the first player can always win if \\( n = 2024 \\).\n\nThus, the smallest number of tiles \\( n \\) such that the first player can always win if \\( n = 2024 \\) is \\(\\boxed{2024}\\).","answer":809,"scores":-3.59375}

This means that each side of \\(ABCD\\) is half the length of the corresponding side of \\(EFGH\\).\n\nSince \\(CE\\) is the diagonal in quadrilateral \\(ABCD\\) and corresponds to the diagonal \\(GH\\) in quadrilateral \\(EFGH\\), and the similarity ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\), the length of \\(CE\\) is half the length of \\(GH\\).\n\nTo find \\(GH\\), we use the fact that \\(EF\\) corresponds to \\(BC\\) and the similarity ratio is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\). Therefore, \\(GH\\) is twice the length of \\(EF\\):\n\\[\nGH = 2 \\times EF = 2 \\times 184 = 368\n\\]\nSince \\(CE\\) is half of \\(GH\\), we have:\n\\[\nCE = \\frac{1}{2} \\times GH = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 368 = 184\n\\]\n\nThus, the length of \\(CE\\) is \\(\\boxed{184}\\).","answer":104,"scores":-4.0}

All cells in the same column must have the same number.\n4. Each number from 1 to 5 must appear exactly once in the grid.\n\nWe need to find the number of ways to fill this grid while satisfying all these conditions.\n\nFirst, let's identify the largest and smallest numbers. The largest number will be 5, and the smallest number will be 1. According to the problem, the cell with the number 5 must be in the same row as the cell with the number 1. This means that the row containing the 5 must also contain the 1.\n\nSince each number from 1 to 5 must appear exactly once in each row and each column, the row containing the 5 and 1 must be a row where both 5 and 1 appear. There are 5 possible rows to choose from for these two numbers. Once we choose a row, we can place the 5 and 1 in that row in 2 ways (5 in the first column and 1 in the second, or 5 in the second column and 1 in the first).\n\nAfter placing the 5 and 1, we need to fill the rest of the grid. The remaining 3 rows and 3 columns must each contain the numbers 2, 3, and 4 exactly once. This is equivalent to finding the number of ways to arrange 3 distinct items in a 3x3 grid such that each row and each column contains all 3 items. This is known as a 3x3 Latin square, and there are exactly 12 such squares.\n\nSo, for each of the 5 choices of rows for the 5 and 1, there are 2 ways to place the 5 and 1, and 12 ways to arrange the remaining numbers. Therefore, the total number of ways to fill the grid is:\n\n\\[ 5 \\times 2 \\times 12 = 120 \\]\n\nThus, the number of ways to fill the grid is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).","answer":902,"scores":-4.5}
