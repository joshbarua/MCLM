The vertices of the hyperbola are at \\((\\pm a, 0) = (\\pm \\sqrt{20}, 0)\\) and \\((0, \\pm b) = (0, \\pm \\sqrt{24})\\).\n\nSince the rectangle is inscribed in the hyperbola, the vertices of the rectangle will be at the points where the hyperbola intersects the lines \\(y = \\pm \\frac{b}{a}x\\).

The sides of the hexagon are AB, CD, and EF, and their lengths are given as 200, 240, and 300 respectively. Since a hexagon has six sides, and only three sides are given, we assume the remaining three sides (BC, DE, and FA) are unknown but do not affect the perimeter calculation if we only know the lengths of the given sides.\n\nThe perimeter of a hexagon is the sum of the lengths of its six sides. However, since the problem only provides the lengths of three sides and asks for the perimeter, we can infer that the remaining three sides are not required for the calculation. Therefore, the perimeter of the hexagon is simply the sum of the given side lengths:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Perimeter} = AB + CD + EF + \\text{(sum of the unknown sides)}\n\\]\n\nSince the problem does not provide the lengths of the unknown sides and asks for the perimeter based on the given sides, we can only consider the given sides for the perimeter calculation.

We are given that circle \\( T \\) has a radius of 3 and circle \\( S \\) has a radius of 11. The problem states that the circles are tangent to each other externally, meaning the distance between their centers is the sum of their radii.\n\nFirst, let's denote the centers of circle \\( T \\) and circle \\( S \\) as \\( O_T \\) and \\( O_S \\) respectively. The distance between the centers \\( O_T \\) and \\( O_S \\) is \\( r_S + r_T = 11 + 3 = 14 \\).\n\nNow, we need to find the radius \\( r_i \\) of the circle that is internally tangent to circle \\( S \\) and externally tangent to circle \\( T \\). This means that the distance from the center of this new circle to the center of circle \\( S \\) is \\( 11 - r_i \\) and the distance from the center of this new circle to the center of circle \\( T \\) is \\( 3 + r_i \\).

Since the equation holds true for any \\( r_i \\), we can use the fact that the new circle is internally tangent to circle \\( S \\) and externally tangent to circle \\( T \\). The radius \\( r_i \\) can be found by considering the geometry of the tangency points. The distance between the centers of the new circle and circle \\( S \\) is \\( 11 - r_i \\) and the distance between the centers of the new circle and circle \\( T \\) is \\( 3 + r_i \\). Since the centers are collinear, we have:\n\n\\[\n(11 - r_i) + (3 + r_i) = 14\n\\]\n\nThis confirms that the setup is correct, and we can solve for \\( r_i \\) by considering the specific tangency points. The radius \\( r_i \\) is the radius of the circle that is internally tangent to circle \\( S \\) and externally tangent to circle \\( T \\). By the properties of tangency, we can use the formula for the radius of a circle that is tangent to two other circles:\n\n\\[\nr_i = \\frac{r_S r_T}{r_S + r_T} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 3}{11 + 3} = \\frac{33}{14}\n\\]\n\nSimilarly, the radius \\( r_o \\) of the circle that is internally tangent to circle \\( S \\) and externally tangent to circle \\( T \\) is:\n\n\\[\nr_o = \\frac{r_S r_T}{r_S + r_T} = \\frac{11 \\cdot 3}{11 + 3} = \\frac{33}{14}\n\\]\n\nThe difference in the radii is:\n\n\\[\nr_i - r_o = \\frac{33}{14} - \\frac{33}{14} = 0\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the difference in the radii of the circles \\( T \\) and \\( S \\), which is:\n\n\\[\nr_S - r_T = 11 - 3 = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the difference in the radii is \\( 8 \\), and the answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]","answer":127,"scores":-3.09375}
