We need to consider two cases: either the side of length 60 is the hypotenuse or it is one of the legs.\n\n**Case 1: The side of length 60 is the hypotenuse.**\n\nIn this case, the side lengths are \\(a-d\\), \\(a\\), and \\(a+d\\) with \\(a+d = 60\\). The Pythagorean theorem gives us:\n\\[\n(a-d)^2 + a^2 = 60^2.\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[\na^2 - 2ad + d^2 + a^2 = 3600 \\implies 2a^2 - 2ad + d^2 = 3600.\n\\]\nSince \\(a + d = 60\\), we can express \\(d\\) as \\(d = 60 - a\\). Substituting \\(d = 60 - a\\) into the equation, we get:\n\\[\n2a^2 - 2a(60 - a) + (60 - a)^2 = 3600 \\implies 2a^2 - 120a + 2a^2 + 3600 - 120a + a^2 = 3600 \\implies 5a^2 - 240a = 0 \\implies a(5a - 240) = 0.\n\\]\nThis gives us two solutions: \\(a = 0\\) (which is not possible for a triangle) and \\(a = 48\\). If \\(a = 48\\), then \\(d = 60 - 48 = 12\\). The side lengths of the triangle are \\(48-12=36\\), \\(48\\), and \\(60\\). The area of the triangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 36 \\times 48 = 864.\n\\]\n\n**Case 2: The side of length 60 is one of the legs.**\n\nIn this case, the side lengths are \\(a-d\\), \\(a\\), and \\(a+d\\) with either \\(a = 60\\) or \\(a + d = 60\\). If \\(a = 60\\), then the side lengths are \\(60-d\\), \\(60\\), and \\(60+d\\). The hypotenuse must be \\(60+d\\), so:\n\\[\n(60-d)^2 + 60^2 = (60+d)^2.\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[\n3600 - 120d + d^2 + 3600 = 3600 + 120d + d^2 \\implies 3600 = 240d \\implies d = 15.\n\\]\nThe side lengths are \\(45\\), \\(60\\), and \\(75\\). The area of the triangle is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 45 \\times 60 = 1350.\n\\]\n\nIf \\(a + d = 60\\), then \\(a = 60 - d\\). The side lengths are \\(60-2d\\), \\(60-d\\), and \\(60\\). The hypotenuse must be \\(60\\), so:\n\\[\n(60-2d)^2 + (60-d)^2 = 60^2.\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\\[\n3600 - 240d + 4d^2 + 3600 - 120d + d^2 = 3600 \\implies 4d^2 - 360d + 3600 = 0 \\implies d^2 - 90d + 900 = 0 \\implies (d-30)^2 = 0 \\implies d = 30.\n\\]\nThe side lengths are \\(0\\), \\(30\\), and \\(60\\), which is not possible for a triangle.\n\nTherefore, the only possible values for the area of the triangle are \\(\\boxed{864}\\) and \\(\\boxed{1350}\\).","answer":"2400, 1350, 864","scores":0.5234375}
