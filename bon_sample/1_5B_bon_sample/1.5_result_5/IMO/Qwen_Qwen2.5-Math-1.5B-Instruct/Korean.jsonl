Each point \\((x, y)\\) can be represented by coordinates \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) where \\( 0 \\leq x, y \\leq 19 \\). We need to ensure that any selection of \\( K \\) points will always include at least one pair of points with the required differences.\n\nTo approach this, we use the pigeonhole principle. We divide the 20 by 20 grid into smaller regions such that within each region, no two points can have the required differences. One possible way to do this is to divide the grid into 40 regions, each of size 2 by 1 (or 1 by 2), ensuring that no two points within the same region can have the required differences.\n\nEach of these regions can hold at most one point without violating the distance condition. Therefore, if we have more than 40 points, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two points must be in the same region, ensuring the distance condition is met.\n\nThus, the minimum number of points \\( K \\) such that any configuration of \\( K \\) points in the 20 by 20 grid will always have at least one pair of points with the required differences is:\n\\[\nK = 41\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the minimum value of \\( K \\) is \\(\\boxed{41}\\).","answer":"100","scores":-3.640625}

Let's denote \\( d = \\gcd(a^n + b, b^n + a) \\). We need to find the smallest \\( N \\) such that \\( d = g \\) for all \\( n \\ge N \\).\n\nFirst, consider the expression \\( d \\mid (a^n + b) \\) and \\( d \\mid (b^n + a) \\). This means that \\( d \\) divides any linear combination of \\( a^n + b \\) and \\( b^n + a \\). In particular, we can consider the combination:\n\\[ d \\mid (a^n + b) - (b^n + a) = a^n - b^n + b - a. \\]\nSimilarly, we can consider:\n\\[ d \\mid (b^n + a) - (a^n + b) = b^n - a^n + a - b. \\]\nBy adding these two expressions, we get:\n\\[ d \\mid (a^n - b^n + b - a) + (b^n - a^n + a - b) = 0. \\]\nThis tells us that \\( d \\) divides \\( a^n - b^n + b - a \\).
