The volume \\( V \\) of a rectangular prism is given by the product of its length, width, and height. Since we are given two dimensions, we can assume that the third dimension is also an integer. The smallest possible volume will be when the third dimension is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 54 and 23.\n\nFirst, we find the GCD of 54 and 23.

Therefore, the third dimension of the prism is 1.

The vertices of the hyperbola are at \\((\\pm \\sqrt{20}, 0) = (\\pm 2\\sqrt{5}, 0)\\), and the foci are at \\((\\pm \\sqrt{20 + 24}, 0) = (\\pm \\sqrt{44}, 0) = (\\pm 2\\sqrt{11}, 0)\\).\n\nFor an inscribed rhombus, the diagonals of the rhombus are perpendicular bisectors of each other and intersect at the center of the hyperbola. Let's denote the diagonals of the rhombus as \\(AC\\) and \\(BD\\), where \\(AC\\) is along the \\(x\\)-axis and \\(BD\\) is along the \\(y\\)-axis. Since the rhombus is symmetric about the origin, the coordinates of the vertices of the rhombus can be written as \\((\\pm a, \\pm b)\\).\n\nThe equation of the hyperbola tells us that for any point \\((a, b)\\) on the hyperbola, the point \\((a, -b)\\), \\((-a, b)\\), and \\((-a, -b)\\) must also satisfy the hyperbola's equation. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{a^2}{20} - \\frac{b^2}{24} = 1.\n\\]\nThe length of diagonal \\(BD\\) is \\(2b\\), so \\(BD^2 = 4b^2\\). To maximize \\(BD^2\\), we need to maximize \\(b^2\\).

The maximum value of \\(a^2\\) is not bounded by the hyperbola itself, but we can consider the fact that the diagonals of the rhombus must be such that they can fit within the constraints of the hyperbola. The maximum \\(b^2\\) occurs when \\(a^2\\) is as large as possible while still satisfying the hyperbola's equation.\n\nIf we set \\(a^2 = 20k\\) for some large \\(k\\), then:\n\\[\nb^2 = \\frac{6 \\cdot 20k}{5} - 24 = 24k - 24.\n\\]\nTo find the maximum \\(b^2\\), we need to consider the limit as \\(k \\to \\infty\\).

Specifically, we can use the fact that the product of the values of a polynomial evaluated at the roots of another polynomial can be related to the resultant of the polynomials.\n\nThe polynomial we need to evaluate is \\(Q(x) = 2 - 2x + x^2\\). We need to find the resultant of \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\). The resultant of two polynomials \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) is a number that is zero if and only if the two polynomials have a common root.\n\nThe polynomial \\(P(x) = x^{12} + x^{11} + \\cdots + x + 1\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, and the polynomial \\(Q(x) = x^2 - 2x + 2\\) can be factored as \\(Q(x) = (x-1)^2 + 1\\).\n\nThe resultant of \\(P(x)\\) and \\(Q(x)\\) is the product of the values of \\(Q(x)\\) evaluated at the roots of \\(P(x)\\). Since \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots, we need to evaluate \\(Q(x)\\) at the complex roots of \\(P(x)\\).\n\nThe value of the resultant is the product of the values of \\(Q(x)\\) evaluated at the roots of \\(P(x)\\). Since \\(P(x)\\) is the 13th cyclotomic polynomial, the roots are the primitive 13th roots of unity. The polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) evaluated at these roots is \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\).\n\nThe value of the resultant is the product of these values. Since \\(Q(x)\\) is a quadratic polynomial, the product of the values of \\(Q(x)\\) evaluated at the roots of \\(P(x)\\) is the constant term of \\(Q(x)\\) raised to the power of the degree of \\(P(x)\\), which is \\(2^{12}\\).\n\nTherefore, the value of the expression is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]","answer":321,"scores":-2.46875}

There are 25 flowers of different colors, and each flower is either red or blue.\n2. The flowers are arranged in a 5x5 grid.\n3. The condition that must be satisfied is that no two flowers of the same color can be in the same row or column. This is known as a Latin square condition.\n\nWe need to determine the minimum number of moves required to satisfy this condition starting from any configuration of the flowers.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Understanding the Latin Square Condition**: A Latin square of order 5 is a 5x5 grid filled with 5 different symbols (in this case, red and blue) such that each symbol appears exactly once in each row and each column. This means we need to end up with a configuration where each row and each column contains exactly 3 red flowers and 2 blue flowers, or 2 red flowers and 3 blue flowers, in some arrangement that satisfies the Latin square property.\n\n2. **Minimum Moves Calculation**: The minimum number of moves required to transform any initial configuration into a valid Latin square can be determined by considering the worst-case scenario. The worst-case scenario is when the flowers are arranged in such a way that no valid Latin square can be formed with the minimum number of changes.\n\n3. **Worst-Case Scenario**: Suppose we have a configuration where we have 13 red flowers and 12 blue flowers, or 12 red flowers and 13 blue flowers, arranged in such a way that it is impossible to convert this into a Latin square with the minimum number of moves. The maximum number of flowers that need to be changed to satisfy the Latin square condition is 12 (since changing 12 flowers will leave us with a configuration that can be adjusted to satisfy the Latin square condition).\n\n4. **Verification**: By trying different configurations and calculating the minimum number of moves required to convert them into a Latin square, it can be verified that the minimum number of moves required is indeed 12. This is because changing 12 flowers can always be done in such a way that the resulting configuration satisfies the Latin square condition.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of moves required is \\(\\boxed{12}\\).","answer":902,"scores":-4.9375}
