Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have a regular hexagon with each vertex colored either red or blue.\n   - The hexagon can be rotated in such a way that all vertices end up in the same color if and only if they were already all the same color initially.\n\n2. **Possible Colorings:**\n   - There are \\(2^6 = 64\\) possible ways to color the vertices of the hexagon, since each vertex can be either red or blue.\n   - We need to count the number of these colorings where all vertices are the same color. There are exactly 2 such colorings: all red or all blue.\n\n3. **Probability Calculation:**\n   - The probability that all vertices are in the same color after a rotation is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.\n   - The number of favorable outcomes is 2 (all red or all blue).\n   - The total number of possible outcomes is 64.\n   - Therefore, the probability is \\(\\frac{2}{64} = \\frac{1}{32}\\).\n\n4. **Simplifying the Fraction:**\n   - The fraction \\(\\frac{1}{32}\\) is already in its simplest form, so \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = 32\\).\n\n5. **Sum of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\):**\n   - The sum \\(m + n = 1 + 32 = 33\\).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{33}\\).","answer":371,"scores":-3.09375}

The volume $V$ of a pyramid is given by the formula:\n\n\\[ V = \\frac{1}{3} \\times \\text{Base Area} \\times \\text{Height} \\]\n\nLet's denote the base area of the pyramid by $A$ and the height by $h$. Then the volume of the pyramid is:\n\n\\[ 54 = \\frac{1}{3} \\times A \\times h \\]\n\nThis can be rewritten as:\n\n\\[ A \\times h = 162 \\]\n\nIf we assume the base is a square with side length $r$, then the area $A$ of the base is $r^2$. Therefore, we have:\n\n\\[ r^2 \\times h = 162 \\]\n\nTo minimize $r^2$, we need to maximize $h$. The height $h$ of the pyramid is perpendicular to the base and can be any positive real number, but for the purpose of minimizing $r^2$, we need to express $r^2$ in terms of $h$:\n\n\\[ r^2 = \\frac{162}{h} \\]\n\nSince $r^2$ is minimized when $h$ is maximized, the smallest possible value of $r^2$ occurs when $h$ is at its maximum possible value within the context of the problem. However, without any additional constraints on $h$, the smallest integer value for $r^2$ occurs when $h$ is the largest possible integer that still allows $r^2$ to be an integer. The simplest case is when $h = 1$, but this would make $r^2 = 162$, which is not the smallest possible integer value for $r^2$.\n\nTo find the smallest possible integer value for $r^2$, we need to find the smallest integer divisor of 162. The divisors of 162 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 27, 54, 81, 162. The smallest divisor is 1, but this would make $r^2 = 162$, which is not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 2, but this would make $r^2 = 81$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 3, but this would make $r^2 = 54$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 6, but this would make $r^2 = 27$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 9, but this would make $r^2 = 18$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 18, but this would make $r^2 = 9$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 27, but this would make $r^2 = 6$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 54, but this would make $r^2 = 3$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 81, but this would make $r^2 = 2$, which is also not the smallest possible value. The next smallest divisor is 162, but this would make $r^2 = 1$, which is the smallest possible integer value for $r^2$.\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of $r^2$ is 81, and the values of $p$ and $q$ are 81 and 1 respectively.

We start with \\( n \\) pieces of cake. Each turn, a player removes either 1 or 4 pieces of cake. The game continues until the last piece of cake is removed, and the player who removes the last piece wins. We need to determine the smallest possible value of \\( n \\) such that the second player can always win if the first player starts, and this smallest value is 2024.\n\nFirst, let's identify the losing positions. A losing position is a number of pieces of cake from which the second player can always force a win. If a player is faced with a losing position, any move they make will leave the opponent in a winning position. Conversely, if a player is faced with a winning position, they can always make a move that leaves the opponent in a losing position.\n\nWe can use the concept of the \"winning\" and \"losing\" positions to solve this problem. A position is losing if and only if the next player to move from that position will always lose if the opponent plays optimally. Let's denote the losing positions by \\( L \\) and the winning positions by \\( W \\).\n\nWe start by identifying the smallest losing position:\n- \\( n = 0 \\) is a losing position because the game is over and the player who is about to move loses.\n\nNext, we determine the positions that lead to \\( n = 0 \\):\n- \\( n = 1 \\) is a winning position because the player can take the last piece and win.\n- \\( n = 2 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 or 2 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (either 1 or 0 pieces respectively).\n- \\( n = 3 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 or 3 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (either 2 or 0 pieces respectively).\n- \\( n = 4 \\) is a winning position because the player can take all 4 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (0 pieces).\n\nWe continue this process to identify more losing positions. A position is losing if and only if every move from that position leads to a winning position. Let's denote the positions and determine the losing positions:\n- \\( n = 5 \\) is a losing position because any move leaves the opponent in a winning position (1, 2, or 4 pieces respectively).\n\nWe can generalize this pattern:\n- \\( n = 6 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 piece and leave the opponent in a losing position (5 pieces).\n- \\( n = 7 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 3 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (4 pieces).\n- \\( n = 8 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 4 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (4 pieces).\n\nWe observe that the losing positions are of the form \\( n = 5k \\) where \\( k \\) is a non-negative integer. This is because any move from a position of the form \\( 5k \\) will leave the opponent in a winning position. To confirm, let's check the next few positions:\n- \\( n = 9 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 piece and leave the opponent in a losing position (8 pieces).\n- \\( n = 10 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 2 pieces and leave the opponent in a losing position (8 pieces).\n- \\( n = 11 \\) is a winning position because the player can take 1 piece and leave the opponent in a losing position (10 pieces).\n\nGiven that the smallest positive losing position is \\( n = 5 \\), we need to find the smallest \\( n \\) such that the second player can always win if the first player starts, and this smallest value is 2024. Since 2024 is not a multiple of 5, it is a winning position for the first player. The smallest losing position greater than or equal to 2024 is \\( 2025 \\), which is \\( 5 \\times 405 \\).\n\nTherefore, the smallest possible value of \\( n \\) such that the second player can always win if the first player starts, and this smallest value is 2024, is \\(\\boxed{2024}\\).","answer":809,"scores":-1.375}

We need to find the number of rhombi formed by these diagonals.\n\n2. **Understand the structure of the rhombi**: Each rhombus is formed by the intersection of two diagonals. In a regular dodecagon, the diagonals can intersect to form rhombi in various ways. The key is to count the number of such intersections.\n\n3. **Visualize the dodecagon and its diagonals**: Draw a regular dodecagon and label its vertices. Select the diagonals that intersect to form rhombi. For example, in a regular dodecagon, diagonals connecting vertices that are 3, 4, or 5 vertices apart will intersect to form rhombi.\n\n4. **Count the rhombi**: By examining the structure, we can see that each set of diagonals forming a rhombus involves choices of vertices that are symmetrically placed around the dodecagon.

The sum of the terms in the sequence is 30.\n2. The most frequent term is 9.\n3. The mode of the sequence is a single term.\n\nLet's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence by \\(a\\) and the common difference by \\(d\\). The \\(n\\)-th term of the sequence can be expressed as \\(a + (n-1)d\\).\n\nGiven that the most frequent term is 9, it suggests that 9 is the mode of the sequence, meaning it appears more frequently than any other term. However, since the sequence is arithmetic and the mode is unique, 9 must be the first term of the sequence. Therefore, \\(a = 9\\).\n\nThe sum of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:\n\\[\nS_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + (n-1)d\\right)\n\\]\nWe know that the sum \\(S_n = 30\\). Substituting \\(a = 9\\) into the formula, we get:\n\\[\n30 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2 \\cdot 9 + (n-1)d\\right)\n\\]\nSimplifying inside the parentheses:\n\\[\n30 = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(18 + (n-1)d\\right)\n\\]\nMultiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:\n\\[\n60 = n \\left(18 + (n-1)d\\right)\n\\]\nSince 9 is the mode and appears only once, the sequence must have exactly 6 terms (because the sum of an arithmetic sequence with more than 6 terms would exceed 30 or not have 9 as the unique mode). Let's check if \\(n = 6\\) works:\n\\[\n60 = 6 \\left(18 + 5d\\right)\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 6:\n\\[\n10 = 18 + 5d\n\\]\nSubtracting 18 from both sides:\n\\[\n-8 = 5d\n\\]\nDividing both sides by 5:\n\\[\nd = -\\frac{8}{5}\n\\]\nSo, the sequence is \\(9, 9 - \\frac{8}{5}, 9 - 2 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5}, 9 - 3 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5}, 9 - 4 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5}, 9 - 5 \\cdot \\frac{8}{5}\\), which simplifies to \\(9, \\frac{45}{5} - \\frac{8}{5}, \\frac{45}{5} - \\frac{16}{5}, \\frac{45}{5} - \\frac{24}{5}, \\frac{45}{5} - \\frac{32}{5}, \\frac{45}{5} - \\frac{40}{5}\\), or \\(9, \\frac{37}{5}, \\frac{29}{5}, \\frac{17}{5}, \\frac{7}{5}, -\\frac{3}{5}\\).\n\nThe sum of these terms is:\n\\[\n9 + \\frac{37}{5} + \\frac{29}{5} + \\frac{17}{5} + \\frac{7}{5} + -\\frac{3}{5} = 9 + \\frac{37 + 29 + 17 + 7 - 3}{5} = 9 + \\frac{87}{5} = 9 + 17.4 = 26.4\n\\]\nHowever, there seems to be an error in the problem setup or interpretation.

A total ordering is a subset where the elements can be arranged in a sequence such that each element is less than or equal to the next element. For a set \\( A \\) with \\( n \\) elements, the number of subsets that are total orderings is given by the number of ways to choose a subset of \\( A \\) and then arrange the elements in a specific order. This is equivalent to the number of ways to choose \\( k \\) elements from \\( A \\) and then arrange them in a specific order, summed over all possible \\( k \\).\n\nThe number of total orderings of a subset of \\( A \\) with \\( k \\) elements is \\( k! \\) (k factorial), because there are \\( k! \\) ways to arrange \\( k \\) elements in a sequence. Therefore, the total number of subsets of \\( A \\) that are total orderings is given by:\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=0}^{n} \\binom{n}{k} k!\n\\]\nThis sum is known to be equal to \\( (n+1)! \\). This is a well-known combinatorial identity.\n\nWe are given that the number of subsets of \\( A \\) that are total orderings is 2024. Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n(n+1)! = 2024\n\\]\nWe need to find the value of \\( n \\) such that \\( (n+1)! = 2024 \\). By checking the factorials, we find:\n\\[\n6! = 720\n\\]\n\\[\n7! = 5040\n\\]\nSince \\( 7! \\) is too large and \\( 6! \\) is too small, we conclude that there is no integer \\( n \\) such that \\( (n+1)! = 2024 \\). However, the problem likely intended for us to find the closest factorial that is less than or equal to 2024. The closest factorial is \\( 6! = 720 \\), which means \\( n+1 = 7 \\) and \\( n = 6 \\).\n\nTherefore, the number of elements in the set \\( A \\) is \\( 6 \\), and the sum of the elements of \\( A \\) is simply the sum of the first 6 positive integers, which is:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the elements of the set \\( A \\) is \\(\\boxed{21}\\).","answer":55,"scores":-4.09375}

Additionally, the sum of the numbers in each 2x2 subgrid must be the same. Let's break down the steps to find a solution:\n\n1. **Identify the constraints**: We need to fill a 5x5 grid with the numbers 1 through 5 such that each row and each column contains each number exactly once. Additionally, each 2x2 subgrid must have the same sum.\n\n2. **Calculate the sum of each 2x2 subgrid**: The sum of the numbers from 1 to 5 is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15\\). Since each 2x2 subgrid must contain exactly two of each number, the sum of the numbers in each 2x2 subgrid must be \\(15 \/ 2 = 7.5\\). However, since we are dealing with integers, we need to find a way to arrange the numbers such that the sums are equal.\n\n3. **Construct a solution**: One possible solution is a type of Latin square called a \"semi-mNOP\" or \"semi-magic square\". A semi-magic square is a square matrix in which the sums of the numbers in each row and each column are the same, but the sums of the diagonals do not necessarily need to be the same. However, for this problem, we need to ensure that the sums of the 2x2 subgrids are equal.\n\n4. **Use a known solution**: A known solution to this problem is the following arrangement:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 4 & 5 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\n\nThis arrangement ensures that each row and each column contains the numbers 1 through 5 exactly once, and each 2x2 subgrid sums to 15 (which is the sum of the numbers 1 through 5).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\\\\n\\hline\n2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 1 \\\\\n\\hline\n3 & 4 & 5 & 1 & 2 \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 5 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n5 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]","answer":902,"scores":-3.90625}
