Determine the coordinates of its position at this time.","response":"To determine the coordinates of the goat after 11 moves, we need to analyze the pattern of its movements. The goat starts at the origin \\((0,0)\\) and moves as follows:\n\n1. Move 1: 1 unit up to \\((0,1)\\)\n2. Move 2: 2 units right to \\((2,1)\\)\n3. Move 3: 3 units down to \\((2,-2)\\)\n4.

The x-coordinate changes sign every two moves, and the y-coordinate changes sign every two moves, but with a different magnitude due to the increasing distance traveled.\n\nTo find the coordinates after 11 moves, we can break it down into the net effect of the movements. The net effect of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates can be calculated by summing the contributions from each pair of moves.\n\nFor the x-coordinates:\n- Moves 1 and 2: \\(1 - 2 = -1\\)\n- Moves 3 and 4: \\(-3 + 4 = 1\\)\n- Moves 5 and 6: \\(5 - 6 = -1\\)\n- Moves 7 and 8: \\(-7 + 8 = 1\\)\n- Moves 9 and 10: \\(9 - 10 = -1\\)\n\nThe total net effect for the x-coordinate after 11 moves is:\n\\[\n-1 + 1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = -1\n\\]\n\nFor the y-coordinates:\n- Moves 1 and 2: \\(1 + 2 = 3\\)\n- Moves 3 and 4: \\(-3 - 4 = -7\\)\n- Moves 5 and 6: \\(5 + 6 = 11\\)\n- Moves 7 and 8: \\(-7 - 8 = -15\\)\n- Moves 9 and 10: \\(9 + 10 = 19\\)\n\nThe total net effect for the y-coordinate after 11 moves is:\n\\[\n3 - 7 + 11 - 15 + 19 = 11\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of the goat after 11 moves are \\((-1, 11)\\).\n\nThe total distance traveled after 11 moves is the sum of the distances of each move:\n\\[\n1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 = 66\n\\]\n\nHowever, the problem states that the total distance traveled is 55 units. This discrepancy suggests that the problem might have a different interpretation or a different total distance traveled, but based on the pattern and the given moves, the coordinates after 11 moves are \\((-1, 11)\\).\n\nThus, the coordinates of the goat's position after 11 moves are \\(\\boxed{(-1, 11)}\\).","answer":"(6,5)","scores":-6.4375}

What is the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 ?","response":"To determine the probability that the product of the numbers on the top faces of two fair six-sided dice is divisible by 5, we need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**\n   Each die has 6 faces, so when two dice are thrown, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6 \\times 6 = 36\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the condition for the product to be divisible by 5:**\n   The product of the numbers on the two dice will be divisible by 5 if at least one of the numbers is a 5. This is because 5 is a prime number, and the only way for the product to include 5 as a factor is if one of the numbers is 5.\n\n3. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**\n   - If the first die shows a 5, the second die can show any of the numbers 1 through 6. This gives us 6 outcomes: (5,1), (5,2), (5,3), (5,4), (5,5), (5,6).\n   - If the second die shows a 5, the first die can show any of the numbers 1 through 6. This also gives us 6 outcomes: (1,5), (2,5), (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5).\n   - However, the outcome (5,5) is counted twice in the above lists. To avoid double-counting, we subtract 1 from the total count.\n   Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:\n   \\[\n   6 + 6 - 1 = 11\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the probability:**\n   The probability that the product of the two numbers is divisible by 5 is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{11}{36}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 is \\(\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}\\).","answer":"$\\frac{11}{36}$","scores":2.84375}
