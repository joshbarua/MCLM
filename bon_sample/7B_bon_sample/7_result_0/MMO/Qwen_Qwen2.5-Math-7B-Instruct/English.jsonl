Next, let's set \\( y = 1 \\). The equation becomes\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 f(1)^2) = f(x)^2 f(1).\n\\]\n\nThis tells us that for any \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\), \\( f(x^2 f(1)^2) \\) is a rational number that is \\( f(x)^2 \\) times \\( f(1) \\).\n\nNow, let's consider the possibility that \\( f(1) = 1 \\). If \\( f(1) = 1 \\), then the equations simplify to\n\n\\[\nf(f(y)^2) = f(y)\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(x^2) = f(x)^2.\n\\]\n\nThe second equation tells us that \\( f \\) is a multiplicative function, i.e., \\( f(xy) = f(x) f(y) \\) for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\). Since \\( f \\) is multiplicative and maps positive rational numbers to positive rational numbers, a natural candidate for \\( f \\) is \\( f(x) = x^c \\) for some constant \\( c \\). We need to check if this form satisfies the original functional equation. Substituting \\( f(x) = x^c \\) into the original equation, we get\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 f(y)^2) = f(x^2 y^{2c}) = (x^2 y^{2c})^c = x^{2c} y^{2c^2}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(x)^2 f(y) = (x^c)^2 y^c = x^{2c} y^c.\n\\]\n\nFor these two expressions to be equal for all \\( x, y \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\), we must have \\( 2c^2 = c \\). This equation simplifies to \\( c(2c - 1) = 0 \\), so \\( c = 0 \\) or \\( c = \\frac{1}{2} \\). If \\( c = 0 \\), then \\( f(x) = x^0 = 1 \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\). If \\( c = \\frac{1}{2} \\), then \\( f(x) = x^{1\/2} = \\sqrt{x} \\) for all \\( x \\in \\mathbb{Q}_{>0} \\).\n\nWe need to check if these functions satisfy the original functional equation. For \\( f(x) = 1 \\), we have\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 f(y)^2) = f(x^2 \\cdot 1^2) = f(x^2) = 1\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(x)^2 f(y) = 1^2 \\cdot 1 = 1.\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = 1 \\) satisfies the functional equation. For \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\), we have\n\n\\[\nf(x^2 f(y)^2) = f(x^2 (\\sqrt{y})^2) = f(x^2 y) = \\sqrt{x^2 y} = x \\sqrt{y}\n\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[\nf(x)^2 f(y) = (\\sqrt{x})^2 \\sqrt{y} = x \\sqrt{y}.\n\\]\n\nSo, \\( f(x) = \\sqrt{x} \\) also satisfies the functional equation. Therefore, the only solutions are\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{f(x) = 1 \\text{ or } f(x) = \\sqrt{x}}.\n\\]","answer":"$f(x)=1$","scores":-0.9921875}

What is the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 ?","question":"Two fair dice, each having six faces numbered 1 to 6 , are thrown. What is the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 ?","response":"To determine the probability that the product of the numbers on the top faces of two fair six-sided dice is divisible by 5, we need to consider the conditions under which a product is divisible by 5. A product is divisible by 5 if at least one of the numbers in the product is divisible by 5.\n\nFirst, let's identify the numbers on a six-sided die that are divisible by 5. The only number on a six-sided die that is divisible by 5 is 5 itself. Therefore, for the product of the two numbers to be divisible by 5, at least one of the dice must show a 5.\n\nWe can use the complement rule to find the probability that at least one die shows a 5. The complement rule states that the probability of an event happening is 1 minus the probability of the event not happening. In this case, the event we are interested in is \"at least one die shows a 5,\" and the complement event is \"neither die shows a 5.\"\n\nFirst, we calculate the probability that neither die shows a 5. There are 5 numbers on a six-sided die that are not 5 (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). Therefore, the probability that a single die does not show a 5 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6}\n\\]\nSince the dice are thrown independently, the probability that neither die shows a 5 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{5}{6} = \\frac{25}{36}\n\\]\n\nNow, we use the complement rule to find the probability that at least one die shows a 5:\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{36}{36} - \\frac{25}{36} = \\frac{11}{36}\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top faces is divisible by 5 is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{11}{36}}\n\\]","answer":"$\\frac{11}{36}$","scores":2.75}

Given that $\\mathrm{A}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{E}, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{S}$, and $\\mathrm{W}$ are distinct digits, and that $\\underline{\\mathrm{W}} \\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{D}} \\underline{\\mathrm{E}}+\\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{S}} \\underline{\\mathrm{H}}=T$, what is the largest possible value of $\\mathrm{D}+\\mathrm{E}$ ?","response":"To solve the problem, we start by expressing the given equation in terms of its digits. The equation is:\n\n\\[\n\\underline{\\mathrm{W}} \\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{D}} \\underline{\\mathrm{E}} + \\underline{\\mathrm{A}} \\underline{\\mathrm{S}} \\underline{\\mathrm{H}} = 2030\n\\]\n\nThis can be expanded to:\n\n\\[\n1000W + 100A + 10D + E + 100A + 10S + H = 2030\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n\\[\n1000W + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the largest possible value of \\(D + E\\). To do this, we will try to maximize \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) while ensuring that all digits are distinct and the equation holds true.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible values for \\(W\\). Since \\(W\\) is a digit and the sum is 2030, \\(W\\) must be 1 or 2. If \\(W\\) were 2, the sum would be at least \\(2000 + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H\\), which is greater than 2030 unless \\(A, D, E, S, H\\) are very small, which is not possible since they are distinct digits. Therefore, \\(W\\) must be 1.\n\nSubstituting \\(W = 1\\) into the equation, we get:\n\n\\[\n1000 \\cdot 1 + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we have:\n\n\\[\n1000 + 200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 2030\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 1000 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n200A + 10D + E + 10S + H = 1030\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to maximize \\(D + E\\). To do this, we will try to minimize the values of \\(A, S, H\\). The smallest distinct digits for \\(A, S, H\\) are 0, 2, and 3 (since 1 is already used for \\(W\\)). Let's try \\(A = 0\\), \\(S = 2\\), and \\(H = 3\\):\n\n\\[\n200 \\cdot 0 + 10D + E + 10 \\cdot 2 + 3 = 1030\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n10D + E + 20 + 3 = 1030\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10D + E + 23 = 1030\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 23 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n10D + E = 1007\n\\]\n\nSince \\(D\\) and \\(E\\) are digits, the only possible values are \\(D = 100\\) and \\(E = 7\\), but \\(D\\) cannot be 100 because it must be a single digit. Therefore, we need to try the next smallest combination for \\(A, S, H\\).\n\nLet's try \\(A = 0\\), \\(S = 2\\), and \\(H = 4\\):\n\n\\[\n200 \\cdot 0 + 10D + E + 10 \\cdot 2 + 4 = 1030\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n10D + E + 20 + 4 = 1030\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10D + E + 24 = 1030\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 24 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n10D + E = 1006\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\(D\\) cannot be 100. Let's try \\(A = 0\\), \\(S = 2\\), and \\(H = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n200 \\cdot 0 + 10D + E + 10 \\cdot 2 + 5 = 1030\n\\]\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n\\[\n10D + E + 20 + 5 = 1030\n\\]\n\n\\[\n10D + E + 25 = 1030\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 25 from both sides, we get:\n\n\\[\n10D + E = 1005\n\\]\n\nAgain, \\(D\\) cannot be 100.
