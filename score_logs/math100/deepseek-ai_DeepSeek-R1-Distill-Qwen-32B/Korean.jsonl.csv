"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. It shows a right triangle, right? The points are D, E, and F. From the Asymptote code, I can see that F is at (0,0), E is at (0,7), and D is at (sqrt(51),7). So, let me visualize this. Point F is the origin, E is straight up along the y-axis 7 units, and D is somewhere to the right of E, at (sqrt(51),7). So, connecting these points, we have triangle DEF, which is a right triangle because there's a right angle at E.

The problem says that sin D is 0.7, and we need to find the length of DE. Hmm, okay. Let me recall some trigonometry basics. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse.

Looking at triangle DEF, angle D is at point D. So, the sides relative to angle D are: the opposite side would be EF, and the hypotenuse would be DF. Wait, let me make sure. In triangle DEF, angle D is at (sqrt(51),7). So, the sides adjacent to angle D are DE and DF, but wait, no. Let me think again.

Wait, in triangle DEF, the right angle is at E, so the sides are DE, EF, and DF. So, angle D is one of the non-right angles. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is opposite side EF, and adjacent to side DE. So, the hypotenuse is DF.

So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF. They told us that sin D is 0.7, so EF / DF = 0.7.

From the coordinates, EF is the vertical side from E to F, which is 7 units long because E is at (0,7) and F is at (0,0). So, EF = 7.

So, plugging into the equation: 7 / DF = 0.7. So, DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me calculate that. 7 divided by 0.7 is 10. So, DF is 10 units.

But wait, the question is asking for DE, not DF. So, DE is the other leg of the right triangle. Since we have a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. So, DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2.

We know EF is 7, DF is 10, so DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2. That is, DE^2 + 49 = 100. So, DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. Therefore, DE = sqrt(51).

Wait, but hold on. From the coordinates, D is at (sqrt(51),7), and E is at (0,7). So, the distance between D and E is just the horizontal distance, which is sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51). So, that matches with what I just calculated. So, DE is sqrt(51).

But let me double-check. If sin D is 0.7, which is 7/10, so that makes sense because EF is 7 and DF is 10. So, that ratio is 0.7, which is sin D. Then, using Pythagoras, DE is sqrt(10^2 - 7^2) = sqrt(51). So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, I could have used cosine. Since cos D would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is DE / DF. So, cos D = DE / 10. But I don't know cos D, but since sin^2 D + cos^2 D = 1, so cos D = sqrt(1 - 0.49) = sqrt(0.51). So, DE = 10 * sqrt(0.51). Wait, sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.714, but 10 * 0.714 is about 7.14, which is not sqrt(51). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.714, but 10 * 0.714 is about 7.14, but DE is sqrt(51), which is approximately 7.1414. So, actually, that does make sense. Because sqrt(51) is approximately 7.1414, which is roughly 7.14. So, that's consistent.

So, both methods give me DE = sqrt(51). So, that must be the answer.

Wait, but let me think again. The coordinates given are D at (sqrt(51),7), E at (0,7), and F at (0,0). So, DE is the horizontal line from (0,7) to (sqrt(51),7), so the distance is just sqrt(51). So, that's straightforward.

But the problem gave us sin D = 0.7, so maybe they expect us to use trigonometry instead of just reading off the coordinates. So, let's go through that again.

In triangle DEF, right-angled at E. So, angle D is at (sqrt(51),7). So, the sides: opposite to D is EF = 7, adjacent is DE, and hypotenuse is DF.

So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = 7 / DF = 0.7. So, DF = 7 / 0.7 = 10.

Then, using Pythagoras, DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2. So, DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51. So, DE = sqrt(51). So, that's the same answer.

So, whether I use the coordinates directly or use trigonometry, I get DE = sqrt(51). So, that must be the correct answer.

I think I've got it. So, DE is sqrt(51).

**Final Answer**
The length of DE is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we need to find the length of DE. The coordinates provided are D at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\), E at \((0, 7)\), and F at \((0, 0)\). 

We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\). In triangle DEF, \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side (EF) to the hypotenuse (DF). 

1. Calculate the hypotenuse DF:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
   \]
   Given \(EF = 7\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7 \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

2. Use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE:
   \[
   DE^2 + EF^2 = DF^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   DE^2 + 7^2 = 10^2 \implies DE^2 + 49 = 100 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}
   \]

Thus, the length of DE is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me write down the given values:

\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)

\( c = 2 - 3i \)

So, \( z \) is a complex number, and \( c \) is another complex number which is the center of rotation. The rotation is by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians, which is 45 degrees, counterclockwise.

I remember that to rotate a complex number around another complex number, I need to translate the system so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense because rotating around a point other than the origin requires shifting the coordinate system.

So, the steps should be:

1. Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \) to move the center \( c \) to the origin.
2. Multiply the translated complex number by \( e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) to perform the rotation.
3. Translate back by adding \( c \) to the result.

Let me write this out mathematically:

\( w = c + e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}(z - c) \)

Yes, that seems right. So, let me compute each part step by step.

First, compute \( z - c \):

\( z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) \)

Let me subtract the real parts and the imaginary parts separately.

Real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

Imaginary part: \( -(3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) = -(3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = (-3\sqrt{2})i \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)

Hmm, that simplifies nicely. So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \)

Now, I need to multiply this by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \). I know that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), so for \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):

\( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

So, let me compute \( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Let me factor out \( \sqrt{2} \) from the first term:

\( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Multiplying \( \sqrt{2} \) and \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) gives \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \). So, the expression simplifies to:

\( 1 \times (1 - 3i) \times \left(1 + i \right) \)

Wait, because \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = 1 \), so the entire expression becomes:

\( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \)

Let me compute this multiplication:

\( (1)(1) + (1)(i) - (3i)(1) - (3i)(i) \)

Simplify each term:

1. \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \)
2. \( 1 \times i = i \)
3. \( -3i \times 1 = -3i \)
4. \( -3i \times i = -3i^2 = -3(-1) = 3 \) because \( i^2 = -1 \)

Now, add all these together:

1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i

So, the result of the multiplication is \( 4 - 2i \)

Therefore, the rotated translated point is \( 4 - 2i \). Now, I need to translate back by adding \( c \).

Recall that \( c = 2 - 3i \), so:

\( w = c + (4 - 2i) = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) \)

Adding the real parts: 2 + 4 = 6

Adding the imaginary parts: -3i - 2i = -5i

So, \( w = 6 - 5i \)

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, \( z - c \) was computed as \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). That seems correct.

Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). So, when I factor out \( \sqrt{2} \), I get \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \). Wait, hold on, I think I made a mistake here.

Wait, no, actually, \( e^{i\pi/4} \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), which is \( \sqrt{2}/2 (1 + i) \). So, when I multiply \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \sqrt{2}/2 (1 + i) \), that's \( (\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}/2) \times (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \).

Compute \( \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}/2 = (2)/2 = 1 \). So, that part is correct.

Then, \( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \) as before, which is 4 - 2i. So, that seems correct.

Then, adding back \( c = 2 - 3i \), so 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me check the multiplication again because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, it's easy to make a mistake.

Compute \( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \):

First term: 1*1 = 1

Outer term: 1*i = i

Inner term: -3i*1 = -3i

Last term: -3i*i = -3i² = 3

So, adding up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i. Yes, that's correct.

So, the multiplication is correct.

Therefore, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, but let me think again. The Asymptote code in the problem shows that the point Z is at (2 + sqrt(2), -3 - 3*sqrt(2)), which is the coordinates of z. The center c is at (2, -3). So, when we subtract c from z, we get (sqrt(2), -3*sqrt(2)), which is the vector from c to z.

Then, rotating this vector by 45 degrees counterclockwise. So, the rotation matrix is [cos45 -sin45; sin45 cos45]. So, multiplying this matrix by the vector (sqrt(2), -3sqrt(2)).

Let me compute that:

x' = sqrt(2)*cos45 - (-3sqrt(2))*sin45

y' = sqrt(2)*sin45 + (-3sqrt(2))*cos45

Compute cos45 and sin45, which are both sqrt(2)/2.

So,

x' = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) - (-3sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/2) - (-3*2/2) = 1 - (-3) = 1 + 3 = 4

y' = sqrt(2)*(sqrt(2)/2) + (-3sqrt(2))*(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/2) + (-3*2/2) = 1 - 3 = -2

So, the rotated vector is (4, -2). Then, adding back the center c which is (2, -3), we get:

x = 4 + 2 = 6

y = -2 + (-3) = -5

So, the point w is (6, -5), which corresponds to the complex number 6 - 5i. So, that's consistent with my earlier result.

Therefore, I think my answer is correct.

But just to make sure, let me try another approach. Maybe using complex number multiplication directly.

Given that \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \), which can be written as \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \).

Multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

So, let's compute \( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \).

Multiply term by term:

First, \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second, \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Third, \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

Fourth, \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i^2 = -3 \times (-1) = 3 \)

Adding all these together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

So, same result as before. Then, adding c: 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i.

Yes, so that's consistent.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent \( z - c \) in polar form and then add the angle.

Let me try that.

First, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Let's find its magnitude and angle.

Magnitude: \( |z - c| = \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \)

Angle: \( \theta = \arctan\left( \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \arctan(-3) \). Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, it's in the fourth quadrant. So, the angle is \( -\arctan(3) \) or \( 2\pi - \arctan(3) \).

But when we rotate by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), the new angle will be \( \theta + \frac{\pi}{4} \).

So, the new complex number after rotation is \( 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(\theta + \frac{\pi}{4}) + i\sin(\theta + \frac{\pi}{4}) \right) \)

But this might be more complicated because I have to compute \( \cos(\theta + \frac{\pi}{4}) \) and \( \sin(\theta + \frac{\pi}{4}) \). Maybe using the angle addition formulas.

Alternatively, since I already have the rectangular form, maybe it's easier to stick with the previous method.

But just to see, let's compute \( \theta = \arctan(-3) \). So, \( \theta \) is in the fourth quadrant, approximately -71.565 degrees or 288.435 degrees.

Adding 45 degrees, we get approximately 333.435 degrees, which is equivalent to -26.565 degrees.

So, the new complex number would have magnitude \( 2\sqrt{5} \) and angle approximately -26.565 degrees.

Compute the real part: \( 2\sqrt{5} \cos(-26.565^\circ) \)

Compute the imaginary part: \( 2\sqrt{5} \sin(-26.565^\circ) \)

But \( \cos(-26.565^\circ) = \cos(26.565^\circ) \approx 0.8944 \)

\( \sin(-26.565^\circ) = -\sin(26.565^\circ) \approx -0.4472 \)

So, real part: \( 2\sqrt{5} \times 0.8944 \approx 2 \times 2.236 \times 0.8944 \approx 4.472 \times 0.8944 \approx 4 \)

Imaginary part: \( 2\sqrt{5} \times (-0.4472) \approx 4.472 \times (-0.4472) \approx -2 \)

So, approximately, the rotated vector is \( 4 - 2i \), which matches our earlier result. Then, adding back \( c = 2 - 3i \), we get \( 6","[6, '6']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"Okay, so I need to simplify the square root of 242. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that simplifying a square root involves breaking it down into factors where at least one is a perfect square. That way, I can take the square root of the perfect square and bring it outside the radical.

First, I should figure out the factors of 242. Let me start by checking if 242 is divisible by small prime numbers. I know that 242 is an even number because it ends with a 2, so it's definitely divisible by 2. Let me divide 242 by 2. 

242 divided by 2 is 121. Okay, so 242 can be written as 2 multiplied by 121. Now, I need to check if 121 is a perfect square. I recall that 11 times 11 is 121, so yes, 121 is a perfect square. That means I can take the square root of 121 and bring it outside the radical.

So, putting it all together, the square root of 242 is the square root of (2 times 121). Using the property of square roots that says the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, I can write this as the square root of 2 multiplied by the square root of 121. 

Since the square root of 121 is 11, this simplifies to 11 times the square root of 2. Therefore, the simplified form of the square root of 242 is 11√2.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by factoring 242 into 2 and 121, which are correct because 2 times 121 is indeed 242. Then, I recognized that 121 is a perfect square, which it is because 11 squared is 121. So, taking the square root of 121 gives me 11, and the square root of 2 remains under the radical. 

I think that's all correct. There are no other perfect square factors of 242 besides 121, so this should be the simplest form. I don't think I missed any steps or made any calculation errors. Yeah, I'm confident that √242 simplifies to 11√2.
</think>

The square root of 242 can be simplified by factoring it into 2 and 121. Since 121 is a perfect square (11²), we take its square root, which is 11, and leave the square root of 2 under the radical.

"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when expanding expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. Yeah, the binomial theorem says that \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\). So, I can apply this here.

First, let me identify \(a\) and \(b\) in my expression. It looks like \(a = 10x^3\) and \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\). The exponent \(n\) is 5. So, the expansion will have terms from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 5\).

Each term in the expansion will be \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\). I need to find the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I should figure out for which value of \(k\) the exponent of \(x\) becomes zero.

Let me write out the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times (10x^3)^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying this, I can break it down into parts. First, the binomial coefficient is \(\binom{5}{k}\). Then, \((10x^3)^{5 - k}\) is \(10^{5 - k} x^{3(5 - k)}\). Similarly, \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\) is \((-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{-2k}\).

Putting it all together, the term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times (-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{3(5 - k) - 2k}
\]

Simplifying the exponent of \(x\):

\[
3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Okay, so the constant term occurs when \(k = 3\). Now, let's compute that specific term.

First, the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{3}\). I know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \binom{5}{2}\) because of the symmetry in combinations, and \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\). So, that's 10.

Next, \(10^{5 - 3} = 10^2 = 100\).

Then, \((-1)^3 = -1\).

And \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\).

Multiplying all these together:

\[
10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

Let me compute step by step:

First, 10 times 100 is 1000.

Then, 1000 times (-1) is -1000.

Then, -1000 times \(\frac{1}{8}\) is \(-\frac{1000}{8}\).

Simplifying \(-\frac{1000}{8}\), divide numerator and denominator by 4: \(-\frac{250}{2}\), which is -125.

Wait, hold on, let me check that division again. 1000 divided by 8 is 125, right? Because 8 times 125 is 1000. So, 1000 divided by 8 is 125, so with the negative sign, it's -125.

So, the constant term is -125.

Let me just verify my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Identified \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -1/(2x^2)\), \(n = 5\). Correct.

2. General term: \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} (-1/(2x^2))^k\). Correct.

3. Simplified exponents: 3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 5k. Correct.

4. Set exponent to zero: 15 - 5k = 0 => k = 3. Correct.

5. Calculated binomial coefficient: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\). Correct.

6. Calculated 10^{5 - 3} = 100. Correct.

7. Calculated (-1)^3 = -1. Correct.

8. Calculated (1/2)^3 = 1/8. Correct.

9. Multiplied all together: 10 * 100 = 1000; 1000 * (-1) = -1000; -1000 * (1/8) = -125. Correct.

So, yeah, I think that's right. The constant term is -125.

**Final Answer**
The constant term is \boxed{-125}.
</think>

To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times (10x^3)^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying this term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times (-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{15 - 5k}

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be zero for the constant term. Solving \(15 - 5k = 0\) gives \(k = 3\).

Substituting \(k = 3\) into the term:

- The binomial coefficient is \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\).
- \(10^{5 - 3} = 10^2 = 100\).
- \((-1)^3 = -1\).
- \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\).

Multiplying these together:

\[
10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = -125

"Okay, so I have this problem here: when n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, I need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that if n ≡ 2 mod 7, that means when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So, n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. Maybe substituting this into the expression will help.

Let me write that down: n = 7k + 2. Then, substituting into each term:

n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4

n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6

n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8

Wait, 7k + 8 can be simplified modulo 7. Since 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 7k + 8 ≡ 7k + 1 mod 7, which simplifies to 1 mod 7 because 7k is a multiple of 7.

So, now I have:

(n + 2) ≡ 4 mod 7

(n + 4) ≡ 6 mod 7

(n + 6) ≡ 1 mod 7

So, the product (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) mod 7 is equivalent to 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.

Let me compute that step by step. First, 4 * 6 is 24. Then, 24 * 1 is still 24. Now, 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3, because 7*3=21 and 24-21=3. So, 24 mod 7 is 3.

Therefore, the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7 is 3.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with n ≡ 2 mod 7, so n = 7k + 2. Then, n + 2 is 7k + 4, which is 4 mod 7. n + 4 is 7k + 6, which is 6 mod 7. n + 6 is 7k + 8, which is 1 mod 7 because 8 - 7 = 1. So, multiplying 4 * 6 * 1 gives 24, and 24 mod 7 is indeed 3. Yeah, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this without substituting n. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, then n + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7, n + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7, and n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7. So, the product is 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7. 4*6 is 24, which is 3 mod 7, and 3*1 is still 3. So, same result.

Another way to think about it is to compute each term modulo 7 first and then multiply. Since multiplication is compatible with modular arithmetic, I can compute each term mod 7 and then multiply the results.

So, n ≡ 2 mod 7.

n + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7.

n + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7.

n + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 mod 7, which is 1 mod 7.

So, again, 4 * 6 * 1 = 24, and 24 mod 7 is 3.

I think that's consistent across different methods. So, I'm pretty confident the remainder is 3.

Just to be thorough, maybe I can test with a specific number that is 2 mod 7. Let's pick n = 2. Then, (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 * 6 * 8 = 192. Now, 192 divided by 7: 7*27=189, so 192 - 189 = 3. So, the remainder is 3. That matches.

Let me try another number, say n = 9, which is also 2 mod 7 (since 9 - 7 = 2). Then, (9 + 2)(9 + 4)(9 + 6) = 11 * 13 * 15. Let's compute that: 11*13=143, 143*15=2145. Now, divide 2145 by 7: 7*306=2142, so 2145 - 2142 = 3. Again, the remainder is 3.

One more test: n = 16, which is 2 mod 7 (16 - 14=2). Then, (16 + 2)(16 + 4)(16 + 6) = 18 * 20 * 22. 18*20=360, 360*22=7920. Now, 7920 divided by 7: 7*1131=7917, so 7920 - 7917=3. Again, remainder 3.

So, all these examples confirm that the remainder is 3. Therefore, I'm pretty sure the answer is 3.

**Final Answer**
The remainder is \boxed{3}.
</think>

Given \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, we express \( n \) as \( 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \). Substituting this into each term:

\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the product modulo 7 is:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \times 6 \times 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
\[
4 \times 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \times 1 = 24
\]
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

"Okay, so I have this problem about a right-angled triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees. They tell me that sin A equals 2 times cos A, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the sine and cosine of an angle are related to the sides. Specifically, for angle A, sin A is the opposite side over the hypotenuse, and cos A is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. So, if I let the sides be labeled as follows: opposite side to angle A is 'a', adjacent side is 'b', and hypotenuse is 'c', then sin A = a/c and cos A = b/c.

The problem says sin A = 2 cos A. So, substituting the expressions I have, that would be a/c = 2*(b/c). Hmm, okay, so if I write that out, it's a/c = 2b/c. Wait, both sides have a denominator of c, so I can multiply both sides by c to eliminate the denominators. That gives me a = 2b. So, the side opposite angle A is twice the length of the adjacent side.

Now, I need to find tan A. I remember that tan A is sin A over cos A, which is (a/c) / (b/c). The c's cancel out, so tan A is a/b. From earlier, I found that a = 2b, so substituting that in, tan A = (2b)/b. The b's cancel out, so tan A = 2.

Wait, let me double-check that. If a = 2b, then tan A = a/b = 2b/b = 2. Yeah, that seems right. Alternatively, I could use the identity that relates tan to sin and cos. Since tan A = sin A / cos A, and we know sin A = 2 cos A, so substituting that in, tan A = (2 cos A) / cos A = 2. Yep, same result.

Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me think about the triangle. If angle A has sides a, b, c with a = 2b, then using Pythagoras' theorem, c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (2b)^2 + b^2 = 4b^2 + b^2 = 5b^2. So, c = b√5. Then, sin A = a/c = 2b/(b√5) = 2/√5, and cos A = b/c = b/(b√5) = 1/√5. So, sin A is indeed 2 times cos A because 2/√5 is 2*(1/√5). That checks out.

Therefore, tan A is 2. I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\tan A$ is \boxed{2}.
</think>

In a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we are given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

First, recall that in a right-angled triangle, \(\sin A\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, and \(\cos A\) is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Let the sides be labeled as follows: opposite side to angle \(A\) is \(a\), adjacent side is \(b\), and hypotenuse is \(c\). Thus, \(\sin A = \frac{a}{c}\) and \(\cos A = \frac{b}{c}\).

Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we substitute the expressions:
\[
\frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(c\) to eliminate the denominators, we get:
\[
a = 2b
\]

To find \(\tan A\), we use the identity \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\). Substituting the given relationship:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A} = \frac{2 \cos A}{\cos A} = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x -14), and I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote, then add them up as a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values.

The denominator is x² - 5x -14. Let me try factoring that. I need two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Let's see, factors of 14 are 1 and 14, 2 and 7. Hmm, 2 and 7. If I take -7 and +2, that would give me -7 + 2 = -5, and (-7)*(2) = -14. Perfect! So, the denominator factors as (x - 7)(x + 2). 

So, the function becomes f(x) = (2x)/[(x - 7)(x + 2)]. Therefore, the denominator is zero when x = 7 or x = -2. Now, I should check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is 2x, so when x = 7, numerator is 14, which isn't zero, and when x = -2, numerator is -4, also not zero. So, both x = 7 and x = -2 are vertical asymptotes. So, a and b are 7 and -2. I think the order doesn't matter since we're just adding them later.

Next, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and denominator. The numerator is degree 1, and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c is 0.

Wait, let me make sure. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote, but maybe an oblique one. But in this case, numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2, so yes, horizontal asymptote is y = 0.

So, now I have a = 7, b = -2, c = 0. Adding them together: 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. So, the sum is 5.

Wait, let me double-check my factoring. x² -5x -14. Let me expand (x -7)(x +2) to make sure. x*x = x², x*2 = 2x, -7*x = -7x, -7*2 = -14. So, combining like terms: x² +2x -7x -14 = x² -5x -14. Yep, that's correct.

And for the horizontal asymptote, since the denominator's degree is higher, it's definitely y=0. So, I think I'm confident with that.

So, a + b + c is 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. So, the answer should be 5.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{5}\).

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we factor the denominator:

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Thus, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

For the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1 and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( c = 0 \).

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for every 2-dimensional vector \( \bold{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, okay. I remember that this kind of problem relates to the concept of the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, specifically the induced 2-norm, is the smallest such \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all vectors \( \bold{v} \). So, I think I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.

But wait, how do I compute the operator norm? I recall that for a matrix \( A \), the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm is equal to the largest singular value of \( A \). So, maybe I should compute the singular values of the matrix and take the largest one as \( C \).

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). That might be a more straightforward method since I can compute \( A^T A \) and then find its eigenvalues.

Let me write down the matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

First, I need to compute \( A^T \), the transpose of \( A \):

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, multiply \( A^T \) by \( A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me perform the matrix multiplication step by step.

First row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 2 \times 2 + 0 \times 0 = 4 + 0 = 4 \)

First row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 2 \times 3 + 0 \times (-2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 3 \times 2 + (-2) \times 0 = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 3 \times 3 + (-2) \times (-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So, putting it all together, \( A^T A \) is:

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) satisfy the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

So, let's compute the determinant:

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - (6)(6)
\]

Calculating this:

First, expand \( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) \):

\( 4 \times 13 = 52 \)

\( 4 \times (-\lambda) = -4\lambda \)

\( -\lambda \times 13 = -13\lambda \)

\( -\lambda \times (-\lambda) = \lambda^2 \)

So, \( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 \)

Then subtract \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \):

So, the determinant is \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 \)

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Now, solving for \( \lambda \):

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, the two eigenvalues are:

1. \( \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm \( C \) is the square root of 16, which is 4.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 16 seems a bit high. Let me verify the multiplication of \( A^T A \) again.

Original matrix \( A \):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Transpose \( A^T \):

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Multiplying \( A^T A \):

First element: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4

First row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6

Second row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6 + 0 = 6

Second row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13

So, yes, \( A^T A \) is indeed:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Then, the determinant calculation:

\( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 -17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 -17\lambda +16 \). That seems correct.

Solving \( \lambda^2 -17\lambda +16 = 0 \), discriminant is \( 289 - 64 = 225 \), so roots are \( (17 \pm 15)/2 \), which gives 16 and 1. So, yes, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1.

Therefore, the largest singular value is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). So, the operator norm is 4. Therefore, the smallest such \( C \) is 4.

But wait, another way to think about this is to consider the maximum stretching factor of the matrix. Since the matrix is upper triangular, its eigenvalues are 2 and -2. But operator norm isn't just the maximum of the absolute values of eigenvalues, right? Because the matrix isn't necessarily symmetric or diagonalizable in a way that the operator norm is just the spectral radius.

Wait, actually, for non-normal matrices, the operator norm can be larger than the spectral radius. So, in this case, the matrix isn't symmetric, so its operator norm isn't just the maximum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. So, in this case, the eigenvalues are 2 and -2, but the operator norm is 4, which is larger than 2. So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, another approach is to parametrize the vector \( \bold{v} \) as \( \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), compute \( A \bold{v} \), find its norm, and then find the maximum value of \( \frac{\|A \bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|} \).

Let me try that approach as a verification.

Let \( \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ 0x - 2y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is:

\[
\sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}
\]

The norm of \( \bold{v} \) is:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

So, we need to maximize the ratio:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
\]

Let me square the ratio to make it easier:

\[
\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Let me denote \( t = \frac{x}{y} \), assuming \( y \neq 0 \). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}
\]

We can now consider this as a function of \( t \):

\[
f(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}
\]

To find its maximum, take the derivative with respect to \( t \) and set it to zero.

First, compute \( f'(t) \):

Using the quotient rule:

\[
f'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

First term: \( (8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) = 8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 \)

Second term: \( (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t) = 8t^3 + 24t^2 + 26t \)

Subtracting the second term from the first:

\( (8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12) - (8t^3 + 24t^2 + 26t) \)

Simplify term by term:

- \( 8t^3 - 8t^3 = 0 \)
- \( 12t^2 - 24t^2 = -12t^2 \)
- \( 8t - 26t = -18t \)
- \( 12 \) remains

So, numerator becomes:

\( -12t^2 - 18t + 12 \)

Set numerator equal to zero:

\( -12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( 12t^2 + 18t - 12 = 0 \)

Divide both sides by 6:

\( 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0 \)

Solve for \( t \):

Using quadratic formula:

\( t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4} \)

So, two solutions:

1. \( t = \frac{-3 + 5}{4} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \)
2. \( t = \frac{-3 - 5}{4} = \frac{-8}{4} = -2 \)

So, critical points at \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \).

Now, evaluate \( f(t) \) at these points.

First, \( t = \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{4 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 12 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) + 13}{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 1} = \frac{4 \times \frac{1}{4} + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 20 \times \frac{4}{5} = 16
\]

Wait, that's 16? But that's the square of the ratio. So, the ratio itself would be 4.

Wait, hold on. Wait, no, \( f(t) \) is the square of the ratio, so \( f(t) = \left( \frac{\|A \bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|} \right)^2 \). So, if \( f(t) = 16 \), then the ratio is 4.

Similarly, let's check \( t = -2 \):

\[
f(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1
\]

So, the maximum value of \( f(t) \) is 16, which occurs at \( t = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, the maximum ratio \( \frac{\|A \bold{v}\|}{\|\","[Eq(t, 1/2), 't = \\frac{1}{2}']",4,"[4, '4']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) where \( z \) is a complex number satisfying \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the equation \( z^5 = 1 \) means that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). These roots can be expressed in the form \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we're looking at the primitive 5th roots of unity, which correspond to \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

Now, I need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Let me denote this expression as \( S \). So,

\[
S = z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}
\]

I notice that \( \frac{1}{z} \) is the same as \( z^4 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \) implies \( z^{-1} = z^{4} \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^{3} \). So, substituting these into \( S \), we get:

\[
S = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3
\]

So, \( S = z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \). Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. That is,

\[
1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0
\]

So, if I subtract 1 from both sides, I get:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1
\]

Wait, that's exactly the sum \( S \) that I have! So, does that mean \( S = -1 \)?

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let's verify this step by step.

Given \( z^5 = 1 \), so \( z \neq 0 \), and \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). The sum of all roots of this equation is given by the coefficient of \( z^4 \), which is 0. So, the sum \( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \). Therefore, \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think about using Euler's formula. Since \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \), then \( z^n = e^{2\pi i k n /5} \). So, \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \) would be the sum of four terms on the unit circle in the complex plane. But since they are symmetrically placed, their sum should cancel out except for the real parts. Wait, but I already know from the equation that the sum is -1, so maybe I don't need to go into that.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute \( S \) by expressing it in terms of cosine since \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = 2\pi k/5 \). Then, \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \) and \( z^2 + 1/z^2 = 2\cos(2\theta) \). So, \( S = 2\cos\theta + 2\cos(2\theta) \).

Let me compute this. Let \( \theta = 2\pi/5 \). Then,

\[
S = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right)
\]

I know that \( \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right) = \cos\left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{5}\right) = -\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) \). Similarly, \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \) is just \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \).

So, substituting these in,

\[
S = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) + 2\left(-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\right) = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)
\]

Hmm, I wonder if this simplifies to -1. Let me compute the numerical values.

I know that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) \) is approximately 0.8090, and \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \) is approximately 0.3090.

So,

\[
2 \times 0.3090 = 0.6180
\]
\[
2 \times 0.8090 = 1.6180
\]
\[
0.6180 - 1.6180 = -1.0
\]

So, that checks out numerically. Therefore, \( S = -1 \).

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that \( z \) satisfies \( z^5 = 1 \), so \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). We can factor this as \( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \), which is exactly \( S \).

So, both methods confirm that \( S = -1 \).

Wait, but just to make sure, let me try another value of \( k \). Let's take \( k = 2 \), so \( z = e^{4\pi i /5} \). Then, \( z^2 = e^{8\pi i /5} = e^{(8\pi i /5 - 2\pi i)} = e^{-2\pi i /5} \), which is the conjugate of \( z \). Similarly, \( z^3 = e^{12\pi i /5} = e^{(12\pi i /5 - 2\pi i)} = e^{2\pi i /5} \), and \( z^4 = e^{16\pi i /5} = e^{(16\pi i /5 - 2\pi i)} = e^{6\pi i /5} = e^{(6\pi i /5 - 2\pi i)} = e^{-4\pi i /5} \).

So, \( z + z^4 = e^{4\pi i /5} + e^{-4\pi i /5} = 2\cos(4\pi/5) \), and \( z^2 + z^3 = e^{-2\pi i /5} + e^{2\pi i /5} = 2\cos(2\pi/5) \). So, adding them together, \( 2\cos(4\pi/5) + 2\cos(2\pi/5) \). But \( \cos(4\pi/5) = -\cos(\pi/5) \), so this becomes \( -2\cos(\pi/5) + 2\cos(2\pi/5) \). As before, this is approximately -1.618 + 0.618 = -1. So, same result.

Therefore, regardless of which primitive 5th root of unity we take, the sum \( S \) is always -1.

I think that's solid. So, the answer should be -1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-1}
</think>

Given the complex number \( z \) such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to compute the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, excluding 1. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1
\]

We need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Recognizing that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \), we substitute these into the expression:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4
\]

"Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that secant is the reciprocal of cosine, so maybe I can rewrite the first term using that identity. Let me try that.

So, \(\sec x\) is equal to \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x}\) becomes \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). Now, the expression is \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). 

Looking at both terms, I notice that they have a common denominator of \(\cos x\). Maybe I can combine them by getting a common denominator. The first term already has \(\cos x \sin x\) in the denominator, and the second term has just \(\cos x\). So, to combine them, I can write the second term as \(\frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x}\), which is \(\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Now, the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). Since the denominators are the same, I can subtract the numerators: \(1 - \sin^2 x\). 

Wait, \(1 - \sin^2 x\) is a familiar identity. Isn't that equal to \(\cos^2 x\)? Yes, from the Pythagorean identity, \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), so \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). 

So now, the expression simplifies to \(\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). I can cancel out one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator, which leaves me with \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\). 

Hmm, \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is another trigonometric function. Isn't that the cotangent of x? Yes, \(\cot x = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\). So, the simplified form of the original expression is \(\cot x\).

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I converted \(\sec x\) to \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\), then combined the fractions by finding a common denominator. I subtracted the numerators correctly, applied the Pythagorean identity, and simplified the fraction. Everything seems to add up. So, I think the final answer is indeed \(\cot x\).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( a + b \) given that the product of two quadratic polynomials \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \) is equal to \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but since these are quadratics, it's a bit more involved. So, I need to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.

Let me write down the multiplication step by step.

The first polynomial is \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and the second is \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \). So, I'll distribute each term in the first polynomial across the second polynomial.

Starting with \( 3t^2 \):
- \( 3t^2 \times 4t^2 = 12t^4 \)
- \( 3t^2 \times bt = 3b t^3 \)
- \( 3t^2 \times (-2) = -6t^2 \)

Next, the \( 5t \) term:
- \( 5t \times 4t^2 = 20t^3 \)
- \( 5t \times bt = 5b t^2 \)
- \( 5t \times (-2) = -10t \)

Lastly, the \( a \) term:
- \( a \times 4t^2 = 4a t^2 \)
- \( a \times bt = ab t \)
- \( a \times (-2) = -2a \)

Now, let me write all these terms out:

- \( 12t^4 \)
- \( 3b t^3 + 20t^3 \)
- \( -6t^2 + 5b t^2 + 4a t^2 \)
- \( -10t + ab t \)
- \( -2a \)

Now, I need to combine like terms. Let's group them by the power of \( t \):

1. \( t^4 \) term: \( 12t^4 \)
2. \( t^3 \) terms: \( (3b + 20) t^3 \)
3. \( t^2 \) terms: \( (-6 + 5b + 4a) t^2 \)
4. \( t \) terms: \( (-10 + ab) t \)
5. Constant term: \( -2a \)

Now, according to the problem, the product is \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \). So, I can set up equations by equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \( t \).

Let's do that step by step.

1. For \( t^4 \):
   - Coefficient from our product: 12
   - Coefficient from given polynomial: 12
   - So, 12 = 12. That's consistent, nothing to solve here.

2. For \( t^3 \):
   - Coefficient from our product: \( 3b + 20 \)
   - Coefficient from given polynomial: 26
   - So, \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
   - Let me solve for \( b \):
     - Subtract 20 from both sides: \( 3b = 6 \)
     - Divide by 3: \( b = 2 \)
   - Okay, so \( b = 2 \). Got that.

3. For \( t^2 \):
   - Coefficient from our product: \( -6 + 5b + 4a \)
   - Coefficient from given polynomial: -8
   - So, \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
   - I already know \( b = 2 \), so substitute that in:
     - \( -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \)
     - Calculate \( 5(2) = 10 \)
     - So, \( -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \)
     - Simplify: \( 4 + 4a = -8 \)
     - Subtract 4 from both sides: \( 4a = -12 \)
     - Divide by 4: \( a = -3 \)
   - So, \( a = -3 \). Got that too.

4. For \( t \):
   - Coefficient from our product: \( -10 + ab \)
   - Coefficient from given polynomial: -16
   - So, \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
   - Substitute \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \):
     - \( -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \)
     - Calculate \( (-3)(2) = -6 \)
     - So, \( -10 -6 = -16 \)
     - Which is \( -16 = -16 \). That checks out.

5. For the constant term:
   - Coefficient from our product: \( -2a \)
   - Coefficient from given polynomial: 6
   - So, \( -2a = 6 \)
   - Substitute \( a = -3 \):
     - \( -2(-3) = 6 \)
     - Which is \( 6 = 6 \). That also checks out.

So, all the coefficients match when \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with \( b \):
- \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
- \( 3b = 6 \)
- \( b = 2 \). That seems correct.

Then for \( a \):
- \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
- Substitute \( b = 2 \): \( -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \)
- \( 4 + 4a = -8 \)
- \( 4a = -12 \)
- \( a = -3 \). That also seems correct.

Checking the \( t \) term:
- \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
- \( ab = (-3)(2) = -6 \)
- \( -10 -6 = -16 \). Correct.

Constant term:
- \( -2a = 6 \)
- \( a = -3 \). Correct.

So, all the steps check out. Therefore, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = -1 \).

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:

We multiplied the two quadratics, expanded, combined like terms, set the coefficients equal to those in the given quartic polynomial, solved the resulting system of equations, and found \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \). Adding them together gives \( -1 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{-1}.
</think>

To find the value of \( a + b \) given that the product of \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \) is \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

Expanding \( (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \):

1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:
   - \( 3t^2 \times 4t^2 = 12t^4 \)
   - \( 3t^2 \times bt = 3bt^3 \)
   - \( 3t^2 \times (-2) = -6t^2 \)
   - \( 5t \times 4t^2 = 20t^3 \)
   - \( 5t \times bt = 5bt^2 \)
   - \( 5t \times (-2) = -10t \)
   - \( a \times 4t^2 = 4at^2 \)
   - \( a \times bt = abt \)
   - \( a \times (-2) = -2a \)

2. Combine like terms:
   - \( t^4 \) term: \( 12t^4 \)
   - \( t^3 \) terms: \( (3b + 20)t^3 \)
   - \( t^2 \) terms: \( (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 \)
   - \( t \) terms: \( (-10 + ab)t \)
   - Constant term: \( -2a \)

3. Equate the coefficients from the expanded product to the given polynomial \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \):
   - For \( t^3 \): \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
     - Solving for \( b \): \( 3b = 6 \) ⟹ \( b = 2 \)
   - For \( t^2 \): \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
     - Substituting \( b = 2 \): \( -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \) ⟹ \( 4 + 4a = -8 \) ⟹ \( 4a = -12 \) ⟹ \( a = -3 \)
   - For \( t \): \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
     - Substituting \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \): \( -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \) ⟹ \( -16 = -16 \)
   - For the constant term: \( -2a = 6 \)
     - Substituting \( a = -3 \): \( -2(-3) = 6 \) ⟹ \( 6 = 6 \)

Thus, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \).

The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{-1}.","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True

"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the maximum value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, that means for every y-value, there should be some x such that f(x) = y. So, the function needs to be surjective, right?

Let me think about what this function looks like. For x >= a, it's a quadratic function opening upwards if a is positive, or downwards if a is negative. For x < a, it's a linear function with slope a. The function is continuous at x = a because both pieces should meet there. Let me check that.

When x = a, the quadratic part gives f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. The linear part gives f(a) = a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. For the function to be continuous at x = a, these two should be equal. So, a³ = a² + 2a. Let me write that equation:

a³ - a² - 2a = 0

Factor out an a:

a(a² - a - 2) = 0

So, a = 0 or a² - a - 2 = 0. Solving the quadratic equation:

a = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2

So, a = 2 or a = -1. So, the possible a values for continuity are 0, 2, -1. But since a is a parameter, maybe it's not necessarily required to be continuous? Wait, the problem doesn't specify continuity, just that the graph intersects every horizontal line. Hmm, but if it's not continuous, maybe there's a jump, which could affect the surjectivity.

Wait, but if the function isn't continuous, there might be a gap in the graph, meaning some horizontal lines won't intersect. So, maybe for the function to be surjective, it needs to be continuous? Or at least cover all y-values without gaps. So, perhaps a must be such that the function is continuous. So, a can be 0, 2, or -1.

But let's think about each case.

Case 1: a = 0.

Then f(x) becomes:

f(x) = 0 when x >= 0,

f(x) = 0 + 0 = 0 when x < 0.

So, f(x) is always 0. That's a constant function. So, the graph is just the x-axis. It only intersects the horizontal line y=0, but not any other horizontal lines. So, a=0 is not good because it doesn't cover all y-values.

Case 2: a = 2.

Then f(x) is:

For x >= 2: f(x) = 2x²,

For x < 2: f(x) = 2x + 4.

Let me analyze this function.

First, for x >= 2, it's a parabola opening upwards. As x increases, f(x) goes to infinity. As x approaches 2 from the right, f(x) approaches 2*(2)^2 = 8.

For x < 2, it's a linear function with slope 2. So, as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 2*2 + 4 = 8. So, it's continuous at x=2.

Now, let's see the behavior of the function.

For x < 2, f(x) = 2x + 4. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. So, the linear part goes to negative infinity as x decreases.

For x >= 2, f(x) = 2x², which goes to positive infinity as x increases.

So, the function spans from negative infinity to positive infinity. But wait, is that true? Let me check.

Wait, for x < 2, f(x) = 2x + 4. So, when x is less than 2, the function is linear with a positive slope. So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 8.

For x >= 2, f(x) = 2x², which is a parabola starting at (2,8) and going upwards. So, the function f(x) is continuous at x=2, and it's increasing on both sides.

Wait, but is the function surjective? Let's see. For y-values less than 8, the linear part can take any y less than 8 because as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. For y-values greater than or equal to 8, the quadratic part can take any y >=8 because as x increases, f(x) goes to infinity. So, does this function cover all real numbers?

Wait, but what about y between negative infinity and 8? The linear part can take any y <8, and the quadratic part can take y >=8. So, yes, every y is covered. So, for a=2, the function is surjective.

Case 3: a = -1.

Then f(x) is:

For x >= -1: f(x) = (-1)x² = -x²,

For x < -1: f(x) = (-1)x + 2*(-1) = -x -2.

Let me analyze this function.

For x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which is a downward opening parabola. The vertex is at x=-1, f(-1) = -(-1)^2 = -1. As x increases beyond -1, f(x) decreases towards negative infinity.

For x < -1, f(x) = -x -2. This is a linear function with slope -1. As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -(-1) -2 = 1 -2 = -1. So, it's continuous at x=-1.

Now, let's see the behavior.

For x < -1, f(x) = -x -2. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity because -x becomes large positive. As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -1.

For x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which starts at (-1, -1) and goes downward to negative infinity as x increases.

So, the function f(x) for a=-1 has two parts: the linear part goes from positive infinity down to -1 as x goes from negative infinity to -1, and the quadratic part goes from -1 down to negative infinity as x goes from -1 to positive infinity.

So, the function f(x) covers y from negative infinity up to positive infinity? Wait, no. Because for x < -1, f(x) goes from positive infinity down to -1, and for x >= -1, f(x) goes from -1 down to negative infinity. So, the function f(x) can take any y-value except between -1 and positive infinity? Wait, no.

Wait, when x < -1, f(x) = -x -2. So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity, and as x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -1. So, the linear part covers y from -1 to positive infinity.

The quadratic part, for x >= -1, f(x) = -x², which starts at y=-1 and goes down to negative infinity. So, the quadratic part covers y from -1 to negative infinity.

So, combining both, the function f(x) for a=-1 covers y from negative infinity to positive infinity. So, it is surjective.

Wait, but hold on. The linear part covers y >= -1, and the quadratic part covers y <= -1. So, together, they cover all real numbers. So, for a=-1, the function is also surjective.

So, both a=2 and a=-1 make the function continuous and surjective. But the question is asking for the maximum value of a. So, between 2 and -1, 2 is larger. So, is 2 the answer?

Wait, but maybe there are other values of a where the function is surjective without being continuous? Because the problem doesn't specify continuity. So, maybe a can be larger than 2?

Wait, let me think. If a is larger than 2, say a=3, what happens?

For a=3, f(x) is:

For x >=3: f(x)=3x²,

For x <3: f(x)=3x +6.

Let me check continuity at x=3.

f(3) from the quadratic side is 3*(3)^2=27.

From the linear side, f(3)=3*3 +6=15. So, 27 ≠15, so the function is not continuous at x=3.

So, there's a jump discontinuity at x=3. The left limit is 15, the right limit is 27.

So, the function jumps from 15 to 27 at x=3. So, the function f(x) for a=3 is:

For x <3: linear function 3x +6, which as x approaches 3 from the left, approaches 15.

For x >=3: quadratic function 3x², which starts at 27 and goes to infinity.

So, the function f(x) for a=3 has a jump from 15 to 27. So, the range of f(x) is (-infty,15) union [27, infty). So, there's a gap between 15 and 27. So, any horizontal line between 15 and 27 won't intersect the graph. So, the function is not surjective.

Therefore, a=3 is not acceptable.

Similarly, if a is greater than 2, the function will have a jump at x=a, and the linear part will approach a*a +2a = a² +2a, while the quadratic part starts at a³. So, for a >2, a³ > a² +2a, because a³ -a² -2a = a(a² -a -2). For a>2, a² -a -2 is positive because a² grows faster. So, a³ > a² +2a, so the jump is upwards, creating a gap between a² +2a and a³. So, the function won't cover y-values in that interval, hence not surjective.

Similarly, for a < -1, let's say a=-2.

Then f(x) is:

For x >=-2: f(x)= -2x²,

For x < -2: f(x)= -2x + (-4) = -2x -4.

Check continuity at x=-2:

From quadratic side: f(-2)= -2*(-2)^2= -8.

From linear side: f(-2)= -2*(-2) -4=4 -4=0.

So, not continuous. The left limit is 0, the right limit is -8. So, there's a jump from 0 to -8 at x=-2.

So, the function f(x) for a=-2 is:

For x < -2: linear function -2x -4. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity.

For x >= -2: quadratic function -2x², which starts at (-2, -8) and goes downward to negative infinity.

So, the function f(x) for a=-2 has a jump from 0 to -8 at x=-2. So, the range is (-infty,0) union (-infty, -8). Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, the linear part covers y from 0 to positive infinity, and the quadratic part covers y from -8 to negative infinity. So, the function f(x) for a=-2 covers y from negative infinity to positive infinity, except between -8 and 0. So, there's a gap between -8 and 0. So, the function is not surjective.

Wait, but hold on. The linear part for x < -2 is f(x) = -2x -4. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches 0. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity. So, the linear part covers y from 0 to positive infinity.

The quadratic part for x >= -2 is f(x) = -2x², which starts at (-2, -8) and goes down to negative infinity. So, the quadratic part covers y from -8 to negative infinity.

So, the function f(x) for a=-2 covers y from negative infinity to positive infinity, except between -8 and 0. So, any horizontal line between -8 and 0 won't intersect the graph. Hence, the function is not surjective.

Therefore, for a < -1, the function is not surjective because of the gap between the linear and quadratic parts.

So, only when a=2 and a=-1, the function is continuous and surjective. But the question is asking for the maximum value of a. So, between 2 and -1, 2 is larger. So, the maximum value of a is 2.

Wait, but let me check if a can be greater than 2 but still have the function surjective without being continuous. For example, maybe if the jump is filled in some way? But no, because if a >2, the function jumps from a lower value to a higher value, creating a gap. So, the function can't cover all y-values.

Similarly, for a between -1 and 2, what happens? Let's say a=1.

Then f(x) is:

For x >=1: f(x)=1x²,

For x <1: f(x)=1x +2*1= x +2.

Check continuity at x=1:

f(1) from quadratic side: 1*(1)^2=1.

From linear side: 1 +2=3. So, not continuous. The left limit is 3, the right limit is 1. So, there's a jump downward from 3 to 1 at x=1.

So, the function f(x) for a=1 is:

For x <1: linear function x +2, which as x approaches 1 from the left, approaches 3. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity.

For x >=1: quadratic function x², which starts at (1,1) and goes to infinity.

So, the function f(x) for a=1 has a jump from 3 to 1 at x=1. So, the range is (-infty,3) union [1, infty). So, there's a gap between 1 and 3. So, the function is not surjective.

Similarly, for a between -1 and 2","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here: the equation of a circle is given as \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), and it's said that the radius is 1. I need to find the value of \( c \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is usually written in the form \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center and \( r \) is the radius. So, I think I need to rewrite the given equation into this standard form by completing the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

Let me group the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms together:
\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0 \]

Now, I need to complete the square for the \( x \) terms. The coefficient of \( x \) is -10. To complete the square, I take half of -10, which is -5, and then square it to get 25. So, I can write:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]
Because expanding \( (x - 5)^2 \) gives \( x^2 - 10x + 25 \), so I have to subtract 25 to keep the equation balanced.

Next, I'll do the same for the \( y \) terms. The coefficient of \( y \) is 6. Half of 6 is 3, and squaring that gives 9. So:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]
Again, expanding \( (y + 3)^2 \) gives \( y^2 + 6y + 9 \), so subtracting 9 keeps the equation balanced.

Now, substituting these back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Let me combine the constants:
-25 - 9 + c = -34 + c

So the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (-34 + c) = 0 \]

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check my steps again. Oh, I see, I should have moved the constant term to the other side. Let me correct that.

Starting from:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constants:
-25 - 9 = -34, so:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \]

To get the standard form, I need to move the constant term to the other side:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Now, this is the standard form of the circle's equation, where the right side is \( r^2 \). The problem states that the radius is 1, so \( r = 1 \), which means \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \).

Therefore, I can set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Solving for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ c = 33 \]

Wait, let me double-check my calculations. When I completed the square for \( x \), I had \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \), and for \( y \), \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \). Adding those gives \( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 - 9 + c = 0 \), which simplifies to \( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \). Moving \( c - 34 \) to the other side gives \( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \). Since the radius squared is 1, \( 34 - c = 1 \), so \( c = 33 \). That seems correct.

I think I might have made a mistake earlier when I thought I had a negative sign, but no, it looks like the steps are correct. So, the value of \( c \) should be 33.
</think>

The given equation is \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \). To find \( c \), we rewrite the equation in standard form by completing the square.

1. Group and complete the square:
   \[
   (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0
   \]
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
   \]
2. Combine constants:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0
   \]
3. Move constants to the other side:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]
4. Since the radius is 1, \( r^2 = 1 \):
   \[
   34 - c = 1 \implies c = 33

The value of \( c \) is \boxed{33}.","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function given is f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The function f(x) = λx(1 - x) maps the interval [0,1] to itself when λ is between 0 and 4. So, that's good because the problem states that f maps [0,1] to [0,1], which aligns with λ being in [0,4].

Now, the problem is asking for λ values where there exists an x such that f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So, essentially, x is a periodic point of period 2 for the function f. That means x is not a fixed point, but applying f twice brings us back to x. So, x is part of a 2-cycle.

To find such λ, I need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x, but exclude the solutions where f(x) = x. So, first, let's write down the equation f(f(x)) = x.

Given f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let's compute that:

f(f(x)) = f(λx(1 - x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

We need this to equal x. So, set up the equation:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me write that out:

λ² x (1 - x) (1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Now, let's try to simplify this equation. First, notice that x is on both sides, so we can factor that out. Let's subtract x from both sides to bring everything to one side:

λ² x (1 - x) (1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, this gives us two possibilities: either x = 0 or the term in the brackets is zero.

But x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is also a fixed point because f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1) = 0, which is different from 1 unless λ is such that 0 = 1, which isn't possible. So, x=1 is not a fixed point unless λ is undefined, which it isn't. So, x=1 is not a fixed point.

But in any case, the problem is looking for x where f(x) ≠ x, so x=0 is a fixed point, so we can ignore that solution. Similarly, x=1 is not a fixed point, but let's check f(1) = 0, so f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0, which is not equal to 1, so x=1 is not a solution to f(f(x))=x either. So, the solutions we are interested in are the ones where the term in the brackets is zero.

So, let's set the term in the brackets equal to zero:

λ² (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me expand this expression step by step.

First, let's compute (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Let me denote y = x(1 - x). Then, (1 - x)(1 - λy) = (1 - x) - λy(1 - x).

But maybe expanding directly is better.

Compute (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx²):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1) = 1

1*(-λx) = -λx

1*(λx²) = λx²

(-x)*(1) = -x

(-x)*(-λx) = λx²

(-x)*(λx²) = -λx³

So, adding all these terms together:

1 - λx + λx² - x + λx² - λx³.

Combine like terms:

Constant term: 1

Linear terms: -λx - x = -(λ + 1)x

Quadratic terms: λx² + λx² = 2λx²

Cubic term: -λx³

So, altogether:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.

Therefore, (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = 1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³.

Now, multiply this by λ²:

λ² [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx² - λx³] = λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³.

Subtract 1 from this:

λ² - λ²(λ + 1)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0.

So, the equation becomes:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0.

Let me write it in standard polynomial form:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - λ²(λ + 1)x + (λ² - 1) = 0.

Alternatively, multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.

So, the equation is:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.

This is a cubic equation in x. We are looking for real solutions x in [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x, so x is not a fixed point. The fixed points satisfy f(x) = x, which is λx(1 - x) = x. Let's solve that equation to find the fixed points.

So, λx(1 - x) = x.

Bring all terms to one side:

λx(1 - x) - x = 0.

Factor x:

x [λ(1 - x) - 1] = 0.

So, x = 0 or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0.

Solving λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0:

λ(1 - x) = 1

1 - x = 1/λ

x = 1 - 1/λ.

So, the fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ, provided that 1 - 1/λ is in [0,1]. Since λ is between 0 and 4, 1/λ is between 0.25 and infinity when λ is between 0 and 4. Wait, actually, when λ is between 0 and 4, 1/λ is between 0.25 (when λ=4) and infinity (as λ approaches 0). But since x must be in [0,1], 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. So, 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 implies that 1/λ ≤ 1, so λ ≥ 1. Similarly, 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 is always true because 1/λ ≥ 0. So, the fixed point x=1 - 1/λ exists only when λ ≥ 1.

So, for λ < 1, the only fixed point is x=0. For λ ≥ 1, we have two fixed points: x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ.

But in our problem, we are looking for x such that f(x) ≠ x, so x is not a fixed point. Therefore, for λ < 1, x=0 is the only fixed point, so any solution x ≠ 0 would satisfy f(x) ≠ x. For λ ≥ 1, x=1 - 1/λ is another fixed point, so we need to exclude x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ.

But let's get back to the cubic equation:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.

We can factor this equation. Let me see if x=1 is a root. Plugging x=1:

λ³(1) - 2λ³(1) + λ²(λ + 1)(1) - (λ² - 1) =

λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³ + λ² - λ² + 1 =

(λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³) + (λ² - λ²) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0.

So, x=1 is not a root. How about x=0? Plugging x=0:

0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -(λ² - 1). So, this is zero only if λ² - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1 or λ=-1. But λ is between 0 and 4, so only λ=1. So, when λ=1, x=0 is a root. But for other λ, x=0 is not a root.

Wait, but earlier, we saw that x=0 is a fixed point, so in the equation f(f(x))=x, x=0 is a solution because f(f(0))=f(0)=0. So, x=0 is always a solution, but it's a fixed point, so we need to exclude it. So, in the cubic equation, x=0 is a root only when λ² - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1. So, for λ=1, x=0 is a root, but for other λ, x=0 is not a root of the cubic equation. Hmm, that's interesting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me check again. The cubic equation is:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.

When x=0, the equation becomes 0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -(λ² - 1). So, this equals zero only when λ² - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1 or λ=-1. Since λ is between 0 and 4, only λ=1. So, for λ=1, x=0 is a root of the cubic equation, but for other λ, x=0 is not a root. However, x=0 is always a fixed point, so f(f(0))=0, which is equal to x=0, so x=0 is always a solution to f(f(x))=x, but it's a fixed point, so we need to exclude it.

Therefore, for λ ≠1, the cubic equation does not have x=0 as a root, so all roots of the cubic equation are non-zero, and thus, for λ ≠1, the solutions to f(f(x))=x are either fixed points or period-2 points. But since we are looking for x where f(x) ≠x, we need to find solutions to the cubic equation that are not fixed points.

But for λ=1, x=0 is a root of the cubic equation, but it's a fixed point, so we need to see if there are other roots.

Wait, maybe it's better to factor the cubic equation. Let me try to factor it.

Looking at the cubic equation:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1) = 0.

Let me factor out λ² from the first three terms:

λ² [λx³ - 2λx² + (λ + 1)x] - (λ² - 1) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe factor by grouping.

Let me group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(λ³x³ - 2λ³x²) + (λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1)) = 0.

Factor out λ³x² from the first group:

λ³x²(x - 2) + [λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1)] = 0.

Not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe try to factor the cubic as (ax + b)(cx² + dx + e). Let me attempt that.

Assume the cubic factors as (a x + b)(c x² + d x + e) = 0.

Expanding, we get:

a c x³ + (a d + b c) x² + (a e + b d) x + b e = 0.

Comparing coefficients with our cubic equation:

a c = λ³

a d + b c = -2λ³

a e + b d = λ²(λ + 1)

b e = -(λ² - 1)

We need to find a, b, c, d, e such that these equations are satisfied.

Let me assume that a = λ², c = λ, so that a c = λ² * λ = λ³, which matches the first coefficient.

So, a = λ², c = λ.

Then, the second equation: a d + b c = λ² d + b λ = -2λ³.

Third equation: a e + b d = λ² e + b d = λ²(λ + 1).

Fourth equation: b e = -(λ² - 1).

So, let's write down the equations:

1. λ² d + b λ = -2λ³.

2. λ² e + b d = λ²(λ + 1).

3. b e = -(λ² - 1).

Let me solve equation 1 for d:

λ² d = -2λ³ - b λ

d = (-2λ³ - b λ)/λ² = -2λ - (b)/λ.

Similarly, from equation 3, b e = -(λ² - 1). Let me express e from equation 3:

e = -(λ² - 1","[1, '1']","(3,4]",[],False
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive angle θ in degrees such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The fraction has a numerator and a denominator, both of which are combinations of sine and cosine terms with different angles. Hmm, okay, let me write this down to visualize it better.

The expression is:

tan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]

Wow, that's a mouthful. I need to simplify both the numerator and the denominator. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to make this easier. Let me recall some identities that might help here.

First, I remember that cos(A - B) = cosA cosB + sinA sinB. Wait, but in the numerator, I have cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50. Hmm, that seems like two separate terms: (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) and (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50). 

Wait, actually, if I group them like that, each pair is of the form cosA cosB - sinA sinB, which is exactly the formula for cos(A + B). Because cos(A + B) = cosA cosB - sinA sinB. So, that means:

cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20 = cos(5 + 20) = cos25°
Similarly, cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50 = cos(35 + 50) = cos85°

So, the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°. Okay, that's a good start.

Now, let's look at the denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50. Hmm, this seems a bit more complicated. Let me see if I can group terms here as well.

Looking at the first two terms: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20. That looks like the sine addition formula: sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So, sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 = sin(5 + 20) = sin25°.

Similarly, the next two terms: -sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50. Let me factor out the negative sign: -(sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50). Again, that's the sine addition formula: sin(35 + 50) = sin85°. So, this becomes -sin85°.

Therefore, the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°.

So now, our expression for tan θ is:

tan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]

Alright, so now I have tan θ expressed in terms of cos25, cos85, sin25, and sin85. Maybe I can simplify this further using sum-to-product identities.

I remember that cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2] and sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. Let me apply these identities.

First, for the numerator: cos25 + cos85.

Using the identity, cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°). But cosine is even, so cos(-30°) = cos30°. So, numerator becomes 2 cos55° cos30°.

Similarly, for the denominator: sin25 - sin85.

Using the identity, sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°). Sine is odd, so sin(-30°) = -sin30°. Therefore, denominator becomes 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°.

So now, our expression is:

tan θ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°]

I can cancel out the 2 and cos55° from numerator and denominator, assuming cos55° ≠ 0, which it isn't because 55° is not 90° or 270°, so that's fine.

So, tan θ = [cos30°] / [-sin30°] = - [cos30° / sin30°]

I know that cos30° is √3/2 and sin30° is 1/2, so cos30° / sin30° = (√3/2) / (1/2) = √3. Therefore, tan θ = -√3.

Hmm, so tan θ = -√3. Now, I need to find the smallest positive angle θ where the tangent is -√3. Tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. Since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, it should be in the fourth quadrant, but wait, actually, the smallest positive angle with tan θ = -√3 is 120°, because tan(120°) = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. Alternatively, in the fourth quadrant, it would be 300°, but 120° is smaller.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The tangent function has a period of 180°, so the general solution is θ = 120° + k*180°, where k is an integer. The smallest positive angle would be 120°, right? Because 120° is less than 180°, and adding 180° would give 300°, which is larger.

But wait, let me confirm. If tan θ = -√3, then θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. So, the smallest positive angle is 120°, since 120° is less than 300°.

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Because when I simplified the denominator, I had sin25 - sin85, which became -2 cos55 sin30. So, the denominator was negative, and the numerator was positive, so the overall fraction was negative, leading to tan θ = -√3. So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant.

But since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, 120° is the answer. But wait, let me think again. Is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is in the second quadrant, but if I consider the principal value of arctangent, which is between -90° and 90°, but since tangent is periodic every 180°, the smallest positive angle would be 120°, as 120° is the first positive angle where tangent is -√3.

Wait, but hold on, is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is 60° more than 90°, but in terms of the unit circle, 120° is indeed the first angle after 0° where tangent is -√3. Alternatively, if we think of it as a negative angle, it would be -60°, but since we need a positive angle, 120° is the smallest.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe I can compute the numerator and denominator numerically to see if tan θ is indeed -√3.

Let me compute the numerator: cos25 + cos85.

cos25 ≈ 0.9063, cos85 ≈ 0.0872. So, 0.9063 + 0.0872 ≈ 0.9935.

Denominator: sin25 - sin85.

sin25 ≈ 0.4226, sin85 ≈ 0.9962. So, 0.4226 - 0.9962 ≈ -0.5736.

So, tan θ ≈ 0.9935 / (-0.5736) ≈ -1.732, which is approximately -√3 (since √3 ≈ 1.732). So, that checks out.

Therefore, tan θ = -√3, so θ = 120°, as that's the smallest positive angle where tangent is -√3.

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. Because sometimes, depending on the quadrant, the angle might be different. But in this case, since the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, the overall fraction is negative, so tan θ is negative. So, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. The smallest positive angle is 120°, as 120° is less than 300°, which is in the fourth quadrant.

Alternatively, if I consider the reference angle, which is 60°, then in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. So, 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying the numerator and denominator. Let me go back through the steps.

Numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50.

I grouped them as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos(5+20) + cos(35+50) = cos25 + cos85. That seems correct.

Denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50.

I grouped them as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin(5+20) - sin(35+50) = sin25 - sin85. That also seems correct.

Then, using sum-to-product identities:

Numerator: cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos55 cos30.

Denominator: sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos55 (-sin30).

So, tan θ = [2 cos55 cos30] / [-2 cos55 sin30] = - [cos30 / sin30] = -√3. That seems correct.

So, tan θ = -√3, so θ = 120°, as that's the smallest positive angle where tangent is -√3.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a smaller positive angle? For example, if I consider θ = 120°, but is there a θ between 0° and 180° that is smaller than 120° where tan θ = -√3? No, because tan θ is negative in the second and fourth quadrants, and the smallest positive angle in the second quadrant where tan θ = -√3 is 120°, as 60° is the reference angle.

Alternatively, if I think of θ as 180° - 60° = 120°, which is correct.

So, I think 120° is the correct answer.

Wait, but let me check with another approach. Maybe using the original expression, compute the numerator and denominator numerically and then compute tan θ.

Compute numerator:

cos5 ≈ 0.9962, cos20 ≈ 0.9397, so cos5 cos20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.9365.

cos35 ≈ 0.8192, cos50 ≈ 0.6428, so cos35 cos50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.5265.

sin5 ≈ 0.0872, sin20 ≈ 0.3420, so sin5 sin20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0298.

sin35 ≈ 0.5736, sin50 ≈ 0.7660, so sin35 sin50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.4395.

So, numerator = 0.9365 + 0.5265 - 0.0298 - 0.4395 ≈ (0.9365 + 0.5265) - (0.0298 + 0.4395) ≈ 1.463 - 0.4693 ≈ 0.9937.

Denominator:

sin5 cos20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0819.

sin35 cos50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.3695.

cos5 sin20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.3405.

cos35 sin50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.6284.

"Okay, so I have this function f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²), and I need to find its maximum value where both x and y are between -1 and 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with functions of two variables, one way to find maxima or minima is by using calculus, specifically finding the partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. That should give me the critical points, which could be potential maxima or minima. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can simplify or analyze the function a bit.

Looking at the function, it's symmetric in x and y. That is, if I swap x and y, the function remains the same. So, maybe the maximum occurs when x equals y? That might be a good starting point. Let me test that idea.

If x = y, then the function becomes f(x, x) = x√(1 - x²) + x√(1 - x²) = 2x√(1 - x²). So, now I have a single-variable function: g(x) = 2x√(1 - x²). I can find the maximum of this function by taking its derivative and setting it to zero.

Let me compute the derivative of g(x). Using the product rule, g'(x) = 2√(1 - x²) + 2x*(1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x). Wait, let me double-check that. The derivative of √(1 - x²) is (1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) = -x/√(1 - x²). So, applying the product rule:

g'(x) = 2√(1 - x²) + 2x*(-x/√(1 - x²)) = 2√(1 - x²) - (2x²)/√(1 - x²).

To combine these terms, I can write them with a common denominator:

g'(x) = [2(1 - x²) - 2x²]/√(1 - x²) = [2 - 2x² - 2x²]/√(1 - x²) = [2 - 4x²]/√(1 - x²).

Setting this equal to zero for critical points:

2 - 4x² = 0 => 4x² = 2 => x² = 1/2 => x = ±√(1/2) = ±(√2)/2.

Since we're looking for the maximum, and considering the domain of x is between -1 and 1, let's plug x = √2/2 into g(x):

g(√2/2) = 2*(√2/2)*√(1 - (1/2)) = √2 * √(1/2) = √2*(√2/2) = (2)/2 = 1.

Similarly, for x = -√2/2, g(-√2/2) = 2*(-√2/2)*√(1 - 1/2) = -√2*(√2/2) = -1. So, the maximum when x = y is 1.

But wait, is this the global maximum for the original function f(x, y)? Maybe I should check other possibilities where x ≠ y.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric substitution could help. Since the terms √(1 - y²) and √(1 - x²) remind me of sine and cosine functions. Let me try substituting x = sinθ and y = sinφ, where θ and φ are angles between -π/2 and π/2. Then, √(1 - x²) = cosθ and √(1 - y²) = cosφ.

So, substituting, f(x, y) becomes sinθ * cosφ + sinφ * cosθ = sin(θ + φ). Because sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So, f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ).

Now, the maximum value of sin(θ + φ) is 1, which occurs when θ + φ = π/2 + 2πk, where k is an integer. But since θ and φ are between -π/2 and π/2, the maximum occurs when θ + φ = π/2.

So, if θ + φ = π/2, then φ = π/2 - θ. Therefore, y = sinφ = sin(π/2 - θ) = cosθ. But x = sinθ, so y = cosθ = √(1 - x²). So, in this case, y = √(1 - x²). Similarly, x = √(1 - y²). So, this is consistent with the earlier substitution.

Therefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1, achieved when x = sinθ and y = cosθ for some θ, which implies that x² + y² = 1. So, the maximum occurs on the unit circle within the domain -1 ≤ x, y ≤ 1.

Wait, but earlier when I set x = y, I also got a maximum of 1. So, does that mean that the maximum is indeed 1, and it's achieved both when x = y = √2/2 and when x and y are such that x² + y² = 1?

Wait, let me check. If x = √2/2, then y = √2/2, and x² + y² = (1/2) + (1/2) = 1. So, actually, the point (x, y) = (√2/2, √2/2) lies on the unit circle. So, both approaches lead to the same conclusion.

Therefore, the maximum value of f(x, y) is 1.

But just to be thorough, I should also check the boundaries of the domain. Since x and y are between -1 and 1, the boundaries occur when x or y is -1 or 1.

Let me check the corners: (1,1), (1,-1), (-1,1), (-1,-1).

At (1,1): f(1,1) = 1*0 + 1*0 = 0.

At (1,-1): f(1,-1) = 1*0 + (-1)*0 = 0.

Similarly, at (-1,1) and (-1,-1), f is also 0. So, the function is 0 at all four corners.

What about the edges? For example, when x = 1, f(1, y) = 1*√(1 - y²) + y*0 = √(1 - y²). The maximum of this is 1, achieved when y = 0. Similarly, when y = 1, f(x,1) = x*0 + 1*√(1 - x²) = √(1 - x²), which also has a maximum of 1 at x = 0.

Similarly, when x = -1, f(-1, y) = (-1)*√(1 - y²) + y*0 = -√(1 - y²), which has a maximum of 0 at y = ±1. Similarly, when y = -1, f(x, -1) = x*0 + (-1)*√(1 - x²) = -√(1 - x²), which also has a maximum of 0 at x = ±1.

So, on the edges, the maximum value is 1, achieved at (1,0) and (0,1). But wait, earlier we found that the function can reach 1 at (√2/2, √2/2) as well. So, actually, the maximum is 1, and it's achieved at multiple points: (1,0), (0,1), and (√2/2, √2/2), as well as their symmetric counterparts in other quadrants, but since the function is symmetric, the maximum is still 1.

Wait, but hold on. When I substituted x = sinθ and y = sinφ, I assumed that x and y are between -1 and 1, which they are. But does that substitution cover all possible cases? Or are there other critical points where x ≠ y and x² + y² ≠ 1?

To make sure, let's go back to the original function and compute the partial derivatives.

Compute ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y.

First, ∂f/∂x:

f(x,y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²)

So, ∂f/∂x = √(1 - y²) + y*(1/(2√(1 - x²)))*(-2x) = √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²).

Similarly, ∂f/∂y = √(1 - x²) + x*(1/(2√(1 - y²)))*(-2y) = √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²).

To find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero.

So, we have:

1. √(1 - y²) - (xy)/√(1 - x²) = 0

2. √(1 - x²) - (xy)/√(1 - y²) = 0

Let me denote equation 1 as:

√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)  ...(1)

And equation 2 as:

√(1 - x²) = (xy)/√(1 - y²)  ...(2)

Now, let's square both sides of equation (1):

(1 - y²) = (x² y²)/(1 - x²)

Similarly, square equation (2):

(1 - x²) = (x² y²)/(1 - y²)

So, from equation (1):

(1 - y²)(1 - x²) = x² y²

Similarly, from equation (2):

(1 - x²)(1 - y²) = x² y²

So, both equations lead to the same equation: (1 - x²)(1 - y²) = x² y².

Let me expand the left side:

1 - x² - y² + x² y² = x² y²

Subtract x² y² from both sides:

1 - x² - y² = 0 => x² + y² = 1.

So, the critical points lie on the unit circle. Therefore, the maximum must occur on the unit circle, which aligns with our earlier substitution.

So, substituting x² + y² = 1 into equation (1):

√(1 - y²) = (xy)/√(1 - x²)

But since x² + y² = 1, √(1 - y²) = |x| and √(1 - x²) = |y|. Assuming x and y are positive (since we're looking for maximum, which likely occurs in the first quadrant), we can drop the absolute values:

x = (xy)/y => x = x. Hmm, that's trivial. Wait, let me substitute √(1 - y²) = x and √(1 - x²) = y.

So, equation (1):

x = (xy)/y => x = x, which is always true.

Similarly, equation (2):

y = (xy)/x => y = y, which is also always true.

So, the only condition is x² + y² = 1.

Therefore, all points on the unit circle are critical points. But we need to find which of these gives the maximum value.

Earlier, we saw that f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ) when x = sinθ and y = sinφ, but actually, with substitution x = sinθ and y = sinφ, we had f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). But wait, that might not be accurate because if x = sinθ and y = sinφ, then √(1 - x²) = cosθ and √(1 - y²) = cosφ, so f(x, y) = sinθ cosφ + sinφ cosθ = sin(θ + φ). So, the maximum of sin(θ + φ) is 1, which occurs when θ + φ = π/2.

But since x² + y² = 1, and x = sinθ, y = sinφ, we have sin²θ + sin²φ = 1. Hmm, that's a bit more complicated.

Wait, maybe it's better to parameterize x and y on the unit circle. Let me set x = cosα and y = sinα, where α is an angle. Then, x² + y² = cos²α + sin²α = 1, which satisfies the condition.

Then, f(x, y) = cosα * √(1 - sin²α) + sinα * √(1 - cos²α) = cosα * cosα + sinα * sinα = cos²α + sin²α = 1.

Wait, that's interesting. So, if I parameterize x and y on the unit circle as x = cosα, y = sinα, then f(x, y) = 1 for all α. That suggests that the function f(x, y) is constant and equal to 1 on the unit circle. But that contradicts our earlier result where f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ), which can vary between -1 and 1.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in substitution. Let me check again.

If I set x = cosα, y = sinα, then √(1 - y²) = √(1 - sin²α) = cosα, and √(1 - x²) = √(1 - cos²α) = sinα. So, f(x, y) = x√(1 - y²) + y√(1 - x²) = cosα * cosα + sinα * sinα = cos²α + sin²α = 1. So, yes, f(x, y) = 1 for all points on the unit circle.

But earlier, when I set x = sinθ and y = sinφ, I got f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). That seems conflicting. Wait, perhaps the substitution was different.

Wait, in the first substitution, I set x = sinθ and y = sinφ, which led to f(x, y) = sin(θ + φ). But in the second substitution, I set x = cosα and y = sinα, leading to f(x, y) = 1. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps the first substitution was incorrect because if x = sinθ and y = sinφ, then","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Specifically, vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, I remember that to find the area of a triangle in 3D space, one common method is to use the cross product of two sides. Let me think about how that works.

First, I know that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found by half the magnitude of their cross product. So, if I can find vectors OA and OB, then compute their cross product, and then find the magnitude of that cross product, I can get the area by taking half of that.

Wait, but actually, in this case, the triangle is OAB, so the two sides from point O are OA and OB. So, yes, the vectors OA and OB are the two sides meeting at point O. Therefore, the area should be half the magnitude of the cross product of OA and OB.

Let me write down the vectors:

OA = (1, 2, 3)
OB = (-3, -2, 1)

So, I need to compute OA × OB. The cross product formula for two vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is:

(a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)

Let me compute each component step by step.

First component: a2b3 - a3b2
a2 is 2, b3 is 1, so 2*1 = 2
a3 is 3, b2 is -2, so 3*(-2) = -6
So, first component is 2 - (-6) = 2 + 6 = 8

Second component: a3b1 - a1b3
a3 is 3, b1 is -3, so 3*(-3) = -9
a1 is 1, b3 is 1, so 1*1 = 1
So, second component is -9 - 1 = -10

Third component: a1b2 - a2b1
a1 is 1, b2 is -2, so 1*(-2) = -2
a2 is 2, b1 is -3, so 2*(-3) = -6
So, third component is -2 - (-6) = -2 + 6 = 4

So, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Now, I need to find the magnitude of this vector.

The magnitude of a vector (x, y, z) is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, let's compute each component squared:

8² = 64
(-10)² = 100
4² = 16

Adding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180

So, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Hmm, sqrt(180) can be simplified. Let me see, 180 = 36 * 5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). So, the magnitude is 6√5.

Therefore, the area of triangle OAB is half of this, which is (6√5)/2 = 3√5.

Wait, let me double-check my cross product calculation to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First component: a2b3 - a3b2 = 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. That seems right.

Second component: a3b1 - a1b3 = 3*(-3) - 1*1 = -9 -1 = -10. Correct.

Third component: a1b2 - a2b1 = 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 +6 = 4. Correct.

So, cross product is indeed (8, -10, 4). The magnitude squared is 64 + 100 + 16 = 180, so magnitude is sqrt(180) = 6√5. Then, half of that is 3√5. So, the area is 3√5.

Alternatively, I can think about using the formula for the area of a triangle given by coordinates. But since these are vectors from the origin, the cross product method is straightforward.

Another way to verify is to compute the lengths of OA and OB, and the angle between them, then use the formula (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta). But that would require computing the angle, which is more steps. The cross product method is more direct.

Wait, just to make sure, let me compute |OA| and |OB|.

|OA| = sqrt(1² + 2² + 3²) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 9) = sqrt(14)
|OB| = sqrt((-3)² + (-2)² + 1²) = sqrt(9 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(14)

So, both vectors have the same magnitude, sqrt(14). Then, the cross product magnitude is |OA||OB|sin(theta) = sqrt(14)*sqrt(14)*sin(theta) = 14 sin(theta). But we found that the cross product magnitude is 6√5, so 14 sin(theta) = 6√5, so sin(theta) = (6√5)/14 = (3√5)/7.

Then, the area is (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta) = (1/2)*14*(3√5)/7 = (1/2)*2*3√5 = 3√5. So, same result. That confirms it.

Therefore, I'm confident that the area is 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) with points \( O \), \( A \), and \( B \) given by the vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
= \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Calculating each component:
- First component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- Second component: \( -(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \)
- Third component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, find the magnitude of this cross product:
\[
\left| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a complex number \( z \) such that:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

And I need to find:

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}
\]

Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expressions like \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since \( z \) is a complex number, it might be helpful to express it in polar form. 

First, let me denote \( w = z + \frac{1}{z} \). So, in this case, \( w = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). I recall that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is actually the golden ratio, often denoted by \( \phi \). Interesting, so \( w = \phi \).

Now, if I can express \( z \) in terms of \( w \), maybe I can find a pattern or a recurrence relation for \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). Let me try to find a relationship between \( z^n \) and \( z^{n-1} \) or something like that.

I remember that for such expressions, there's a recursive formula. Specifically, if I let \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \), then \( a_n \) satisfies the recurrence relation:

\[
a_n = w \cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
\]

Is that right? Let me verify. If I multiply both sides of \( z + \frac{1}{z} = w \) by \( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \), I get:

\[
(z + \frac{1}{z})(z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}}) = w \cdot a_{n-1}
\]

Expanding the left side:

\[
z^n + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} + \frac{1}{z^n} + z^{n-2} = w \cdot a_{n-1}
\]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe another approach. Let me consider \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). Then, multiplying \( a_1 = w \) by \( a_{n-1} \):

\[
a_1 \cdot a_{n-1} = \left(z + \frac{1}{z}\right)\left(z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}}\right) = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} + z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}} = a_n + a_{n-2}
\]

So, rearranging:

\[
a_n = a_1 \cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
\]

Yes, that's correct. So, the recurrence relation is:

\[
a_n = w \cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
\]

Given that \( a_0 = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 2 \), and \( a_1 = w = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, I can use this recurrence relation to compute \( a_n \) for any \( n \). But computing up to \( n = 85 \) manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or periodicity in the sequence \( a_n \)?

Alternatively, perhaps I can find a closed-form expression for \( a_n \). Since the recurrence is linear and homogeneous, I can solve it using characteristic equations.

The characteristic equation for the recurrence \( a_n - w a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} = 0 \) is:

\[
r^2 - w r + 1 = 0
\]

Let me compute the roots of this quadratic equation. The discriminant is:

\[
D = w^2 - 4
\]

Given that \( w = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), let's compute \( w^2 \):

\[
w^2 = \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

So, the discriminant is:

\[
D = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Hmm, that's negative, so the roots will be complex. Let me write them as:

\[
r = \frac{w \pm \sqrt{D}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}
\]

This seems complicated. Maybe instead of going this route, I can express \( z \) in exponential form. Let me assume \( z = e^{i\theta} \), so that \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \). Then:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

So,

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}
\]

Wait, let me compute \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Since \( \sqrt{5} \approx 2.236 \), so \( 1 + \sqrt{5} \approx 3.236 \), divided by 4 is approximately 0.809. So, \( \cos\theta \approx 0.809 \). That corresponds to an angle \( \theta \) where cosine is about 0.809. Let me see, \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is approximately 0.8090, which is \( \pi/5 \) radians. So, \( \theta = \pi/5 \).

Therefore, \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \). So, \( z \) is a primitive 10th root of unity? Wait, because \( e^{i\pi/5} \) has order 10, since \( (e^{i\pi/5})^{10} = e^{i2\pi} = 1 \). So, \( z \) is a 10th root of unity.

Therefore, \( z^{10} = 1 \). So, \( z^{10} = 1 \), which implies that \( z^{n} = z^{n \mod 10} \). So, the powers of \( z \) cycle every 10. Therefore, \( z^{85} = z^{85 \mod 10} = z^5 \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{z^5} = z^{-5} \).

So, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^5 + z^{-5} \). So, I need to compute \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} \).

But since \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), \( z^5 = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Therefore, \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check. If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^5 = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^5} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \). So, yes, \( z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

Alternatively, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then \( z^5 = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \), and \( \frac{1}{z^5} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). So, same result.

Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -2 \).

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps. So, since \( z^{10} = 1 \), then \( z^{85} = z^{85 \mod 10} = z^5 \). So, yes, that's correct because 85 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 5. So, \( z^{85} = z^5 \).

But just to be thorough, let me compute \( z^5 \) using the original equation. Maybe I can find a pattern or use the recurrence relation.

Given that \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \), and we have the recurrence \( a_n = w a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \), with \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = w \).

Let me compute \( a_2 \):

\[
a_2 = w a_1 - a_0 = w^2 - 2
\]

We already computed \( w^2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so:

\[
a_2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Okay, \( a_2 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Now, \( a_3 = w a_2 - a_1 \):

\[
a_3 = w \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - w
\]

Let me compute this:

First, compute \( w \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \):

\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1)(-1) + (1)(\sqrt{5}) + (\sqrt{5})(-1) + (\sqrt{5})(\sqrt{5})}{4}
\]
\[
= \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{-1 + 0 + 5}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

So, \( a_3 = 1 - w \). Since \( w = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), then:

\[
a_3 = 1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

So, \( a_3 = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Next, \( a_4 = w a_3 - a_2 \):

\[
a_4 = w \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Compute \( w \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \):

\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - (\sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
\]

So, \( a_4 = -1 - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

Convert -1 to halves: \( -1 = -\frac{2}{2} \), so:

\[
a_4 = -\frac{2}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2 + 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

So, \( a_4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Now, \( a_5 = w a_4 - a_3 \):

\[
a_5 = w \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Compute \( w \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \):

\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-(1 + \sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \frac{-(1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5)}{4} = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

So, \( a_5 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \)

So, \( a_5 = -2 \). That's consistent with what I found earlier when I considered \( z^5 = -1 \). So, \( a_5 = z^5 + \frac{1}{z^5} = -2 \).

Now, let's see if the sequence is periodic. Let's compute \( a_6 \):

\[
a_6 = w a_5 - a_4 = w \cdot (-2) - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

Compute \( w \cdot (-2) \):

\[
\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot (-2) = - (1","[w*(-2), 'w \\cdot (-2)']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and the medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. I remember that the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG is twice as long as GD.

Now, the problem says that there's a line passing through G and parallel to BC. This line intersects AB at M and AC at N. I need to find the area of triangle ENG, given that the area of triangle ABC is 144.

Hmm, okay. Let me sketch this out mentally. Triangle ABC, centroid G. A line through G parallel to BC cuts AB at M and AC at N. So, MN is parallel to BC and passes through G.

Since MN is parallel to BC, triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem. That theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, the ratio of similarity between triangle AMN and triangle ABC is something I need to find. Since MN passes through the centroid G, which divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, maybe this ratio is related to that.

Wait, let me think. If MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, then the distance from A to MN is less than the distance from A to BC. Since G is the centroid, it's located 2/3 of the way along each median from the vertex. So, the height from A to MN would be 2/3 of the height from A to BC.

But wait, if MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, then the ratio of similarity should be the ratio of the distances from A. Since G is 2/3 along the median, the height from A to MN is 2/3 of the height from A to BC. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 2/3.

But hold on, if the ratio is 2/3, then the area ratio would be (2/3)^2 = 4/9. So, the area of triangle AMN would be 4/9 of the area of ABC, which is 144. So, 144 * 4/9 = 64. So, area of AMN is 64.

But wait, the problem is asking for the area of triangle ENG, not AMN. Hmm, so I need to figure out where points E and N are. Wait, E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. So, E is the midpoint of AC, and N is the intersection point of the line MN with AC.

So, triangle ENG is formed by points E, N, and G. Let me try to find the coordinates or use coordinate geometry to find the area.

Maybe assigning coordinates to the triangle would help. Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system. Let me set point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates so that the midpoints will have integer coordinates, making calculations easier.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 0)
- B: (2b, 0)
- C: (2c, 2d)

Then, the midpoints:
- D is the midpoint of BC: ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)
- E is the midpoint of AC: ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)
- F is the midpoint of AB: ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)

The centroid G is the intersection of the medians. The centroid's coordinates are the average of the vertices' coordinates:
G_x = (0 + 2b + 2c)/3 = (2b + 2c)/3
G_y = (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 = (2d)/3

So, G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

Now, the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. Let me find the equation of BC first. Points B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b).

Since MN is parallel to BC, it has the same slope, d/(c - b). The line MN passes through G, so its equation is:

(y - (2d)/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Now, I need to find where this line intersects AB and AC. Let's find point M on AB and point N on AC.

First, let's find point M on AB. AB is the line from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0). So, AB lies along the x-axis, y = 0.

Set y = 0 in the equation of MN:

0 - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify:

-2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:

-2d/3 * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Simplify:

-2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Bring the term on the right to the left:

x = (2b + 2c)/3 - 2(c - b)/3

Simplify numerator:

2b + 2c - 2c + 2b = 4b

So, x = 4b/3

Therefore, point M is at (4b/3, 0)

Similarly, find point N on AC. AC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). Let me parametrize AC. The parametric equations can be written as x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Now, substitute x and y into the equation of MN:

y - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Substitute x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t:

2d*t - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify left side:

2d*t - 2d/3 = 2d(t - 1/3)

Right side:

(d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2b/3 - 2c/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2c/3 - 2b/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)

Wait, maybe factor differently:

= (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3) = (d/(c - b))( (6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3 ) = (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

So, left side: 2d(t - 1/3) = (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

Divide both sides by d:

2(t - 1/3) = (1/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

Multiply both sides by 3(c - b):

6(c - b)(t - 1/3) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Expand left side:

6(c - b)t - 2(c - b) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Simplify:

6c*t - 6b*t - 2c + 2b = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Subtract 6c*t from both sides:

-6b*t - 2c + 2b = -2b - 2c

Bring all terms to left:

-6b*t - 2c + 2b + 2b + 2c = 0

Simplify:

-6b*t + 4b = 0

Factor:

-6b*t + 4b = 0 => b(-6t + 4) = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since AB has length 2b, which can't be zero), then:

-6t + 4 = 0 => t = 4/6 = 2/3

So, t = 2/3. Therefore, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3)

So, coordinates of N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

Now, we have points E, N, and G.

Point E is the midpoint of AC, which is (c, d)

Point N is (4c/3, 4d/3)

Point G is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

So, triangle ENG has vertices at E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), and G((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

To find the area of triangle ENG, I can use the shoelace formula.

First, let's list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Let me write them in order:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Back to E: (c, d)

Compute the shoelace sum:

Sum1 = c*(4d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*d

Sum2 = d*(4c/3) + (4d/3)*((2b + 2c)/3) + (2d/3)*c

Area = |Sum1 - Sum2| / 2

Compute Sum1:

First term: c*(4d/3) = (4cd)/3

Second term: (4c/3)*(2d/3) = (8cd)/9

Third term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*d = (2b + 2c)d / 3 = (2bd + 2cd)/3

So, Sum1 = (4cd)/3 + (8cd)/9 + (2bd + 2cd)/3

Convert all to ninths:

(12cd)/9 + (8cd)/9 + (6bd + 6cd)/9 = (12cd + 8cd + 6bd + 6cd)/9 = (26cd + 6bd)/9

Sum1 = (6bd + 26cd)/9

Compute Sum2:

First term: d*(4c/3) = (4cd)/3

Second term: (4d/3)*((2b + 2c)/3) = (4d/3)*(2b + 2c)/3 = (8bd + 8cd)/9

Third term: (2d/3)*c = (2cd)/3

So, Sum2 = (4cd)/3 + (8bd + 8cd)/9 + (2cd)/3

Convert all to ninths:

(12cd)/9 + (8bd + 8cd)/9 + (6cd)/9 = (12cd + 8bd + 8cd + 6cd)/9 = (26cd + 8bd)/9

Sum2 = (8bd + 26cd)/9

Now, compute Sum1 - Sum2:

(6bd + 26cd)/9 - (8bd + 26cd)/9 = (6bd - 8bd + 26cd - 26cd)/9 = (-2bd)/9

Take absolute value and divide by 2:

Area = | -2bd / 9 | / 2 = (2bd / 9) / 2 = bd / 9

So, the area of triangle ENG is bd / 9.

Now, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC? Using coordinates, it's |(Ax(By - Cy) + Bx(Cy - Ay) + Cx(Ay - By))/2|

Plugging in A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d):

Area ABC = |0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0)| / 2 = |0 + 4bd + 0| / 2 = |4bd| / 2 = 2|bd|

Given that area ABC is 144, so 2|bd| = 144 => |bd| = 72

Therefore, bd = ±72, but since area is positive, we can say bd = 72.

So, the area of triangle ENG is bd / 9 = 72 / 9 = 8

Therefore, the area is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with coordinates, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, the shoelace formula: I think I did it correctly, but let me verify.

Coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Compute Sum1:

E.x * N.y = c * (4d/3) = 4cd/3

N.x * G.y = (4c/3) * (2d/3) = 8cd/9

G.x * E.y = ((2b + 2c)/3) * d = (2bd + 2cd)/3

Sum1 = 4cd/3 + 8cd/9 + (2bd + 2cd)/3

Convert to ninths:

12cd/9 + 8cd/9 + 6bd/9 + 6cd/9 = (12cd + ","[6, '6']",8,"[8, '8']",False

"Okay, so I have this fraction, 21 over (2 squared times 5 to the seventh power), and I need to convert it into a finite decimal. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that a fraction will be a finite decimal if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator is already 2² multiplied by 5⁷, so that should work out.

First, let me write down the fraction: 21/(2² * 5⁷). I need to convert this into a decimal. I think the way to do this is to make the denominator a power of 10 because decimals are based on tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc., which are powers of 10. Since 10 is 2 times 5, and the denominator is already a product of powers of 2 and 5, I can adjust the numerator and denominator to make the denominator a power of 10.

So, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷. Let me calculate what that is. 2 squared is 4, and 5 to the seventh power is... let me compute that step by step. 5^1 is 5, 5^2 is 25, 5^3 is 125, 5^4 is 625, 5^5 is 3125, 5^6 is 15625, and 5^7 is 78125. So, 2² is 4, and 5⁷ is 78125. Multiplying those together, 4 * 78125. Let me do that multiplication: 78125 * 4. 78125 * 2 is 156250, so times 4 is 312500. So the denominator is 312500.

So, the fraction is 21/312500. Now, to convert this into a decimal, I can perform the division 21 divided by 312500. Alternatively, since the denominator is a power of 10, I can adjust the numerator to make the denominator 10^n. Let me see, 312500 is 10^5 multiplied by 3.125, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, I can think of 312500 as 10^5 * 3.125, but maybe a better approach is to adjust the numerator and denominator so that the denominator becomes a power of 10.

Wait, another way is to note that 2² * 5⁷ can be written as 5⁵ * (2² * 5²) because 5⁷ is 5⁵ * 5², and 2² * 5² is 10², which is 100. So, 2² * 5⁷ = 5⁵ * 100. Therefore, the denominator is 5⁵ * 100. Hmm, but 5⁵ is 3125, so 3125 * 100 is 312500, which matches what I had before.

Alternatively, maybe I can adjust the fraction so that the denominator becomes 10^7, since 5⁷ is part of the denominator. Let me see: 2² is 4, so 2² * 5⁷ is 4 * 5⁷. To make the denominator 10^7, I need to multiply both numerator and denominator by 2^5, because 10^7 is 2^7 * 5^7. So, currently, the denominator is 2² * 5⁷, so to get to 2^7 * 5^7, I need to multiply by 2^(7-2) = 2^5. So, I'll multiply numerator and denominator by 2^5.

2^5 is 32. So, multiplying numerator 21 by 32 gives 21 * 32. Let me compute that: 20*32 is 640, and 1*32 is 32, so total is 672. The denominator becomes 2^7 * 5^7, which is 10^7, which is 10,000,000. So now the fraction is 672/10,000,000.

To convert this into a decimal, I can write it as 0.0000672 because 672 divided by 10,000,000 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. Let me verify that: 672 divided by 10 is 67.2, divided by 10 again is 6.72, again is 0.672, again is 0.0672, again is 0.00672, again is 0.000672, and again is 0.0000672. Yes, that seems right.

Alternatively, I could have done the division 21 divided by 312500 directly. Let me try that to confirm. 21 divided by 312500. Since 312500 goes into 21 zero times, I add a decimal point and some zeros. 312500 goes into 210000 zero times. 312500 goes into 2100000 how many times? Let me see: 312500 * 6 is 1,875,000, which is less than 2,100,000. 312500 * 7 is 2,187,500, which is more than 2,100,000. So it goes 6 times. 6 * 312500 is 1,875,000. Subtract that from 2,100,000, we get 225,000. Bring down the next zero, making it 2,250,000. 312500 goes into that 7 times because 312500 * 7 is 2,187,500. Subtracting gives 62,500. Bring down a zero, making it 625,000. 312500 goes into that exactly 2 times. So putting it all together, we have 0.0000672.

Wait, let me recount the decimal places. When I did 21 divided by 312500, I added a decimal and then started with 210000, which is 210000.0. So the first division step after the decimal is 210000 divided by 312500, which is 0. So we have 0., then 0.0, then 0.00, then 0.000, then 0.0000, then 0.00006, and so on. Wait, maybe I miscounted the decimal places. Let me think again.

Alternatively, since the denominator is 10^7 after multiplying numerator and denominator by 32, the decimal should have 7 places. So 672 divided by 10^7 is 0.0000672, which is 6.72 x 10^-5. So that seems correct.

Another way to think about it is to express the original fraction as 21/(2² * 5⁷). To make the denominator a power of 10, we need to have equal numbers of 2s and 5s. Since there are more 5s (7) than 2s (2), we need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7-2)=2^5=32 to balance it out. So, 21*32=672, and denominator becomes 10^7=10,000,000. So, 672/10,000,000=0.0000672.

Yes, that makes sense. So the finite decimal representation of 21/(2² * 5⁷) is 0.0000672.
</think>

The fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) can be converted into a finite decimal by adjusting the denominator to a power of 10. 

First, note that the denominator \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\) can be balanced by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \(2^5\) to make the denominator \(10^7\). This gives:

\[
\frac{21 \times 32}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \times 2^5} = \frac{672}{10^7}
\]

Converting this to a decimal involves placing the numerator 672 over 10,000,000, which results in moving the decimal point seven places to the left:

\[
\frac{672}{10,000,000} = 0.0000672
\]

Thus, the finite decimal representation is:

"좋아, 이 문제는 양의 정수 n > 1에 대해 2^24가 완전한 n번째 제곱인 경우가 몇 개인지를 구하는 문제다. 처음에 이 문제를 보았을 때, 완전한 n번째 제곱이란 무엇인지부터 생각해봐야겠어. 완전한 n번째 제곱이란, 어떤 정수 k에 대해 k^n = 2^24인 경우를 말하는 거 같아. 그러니까, 2^24를 n번째 제곱으로 표현할 수 있는 n의 개수를 찾는 거라고 이해했어.

먼저, 2^24를 n번째 제곱으로 표현할 수 있는 조건은 무엇일까? 만약 k^n = 2^24라면, k는 2^m 형태의 수여야겠지. 왜냐하면 2^24는 2의冪이기 때문이다. 그래서 k = 2^m이라고 가정하면, k^n = (2^m)^n = 2^{m*n} = 2^24. 이때 지수 부분이 같아야 하기 때문에 m*n = 24가 되어야 한다. 즉, m = 24/n이어야 한다. 그런데 m은 정수여야 하기 때문에, n이 24의 약수여야 한다는 결론이 나올 수 있을 것 같아.

그럼, n > 1인 양의 정수 중에서 24의 약수인 n의 개수를 세면 될 것 같아. 24의 약수는 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24이지. 그런데 문제에서 n > 1이기 때문에 1은 제외하고, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24까지 총 7개가 될 것 같았어. 그런데, 이 중에서 n이 24의 약수이기만 하면 k = 2^{24/n}이 정수가 되기 때문에, 2^24가 완전한 n번째 제곱이 되는 n의 개수는 7개라고 생각했어.

하지만, 이쯤에서 조금 더 생각을 해봐야겠어. 왜냐하면, n이 24의 약수이기만 하면 k가 정수가 되기 때문에, 2^24 = (2^{24/n})^n이 성립하니까, n이 24의 약수인 모든 n > 1에 대해 2^24는 완전한 n번째 제곱이 되는 거지. 그래서 24의 약수 중 n > 1인 약수의 개수를 세면 답이 될 것 같아.

24의 약수는 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. 총 8개인데, n > 1이기 때문에 1을 제외하면 7개가 남는다. 그래서 7개라고 생각했어. 그런데, 혹시 이 중에서 n이 24보다 큰 수는 있을 수 없을까? 예를 들어, n이 24보다 크면 24/n이 1보다 작아지기 때문에 m = 24/n이 정수가 될 수 없을 테니까, n은 24 이하여야 한다. 그래서 24의 약수 중에서 n > 1인 약수는 7개밖에 없을 것 같아.

그래서, 2^24가 완전한 n번째 제곱인 n의 개수는 7개라고 생각했어. 그래서, 이 문제의 답은 7개인 것 같아.

양의 정수 \( n > 1 \)에 대해 \( 2^{24} \)이 완전한 \( n^{\text{th}} \) 제곱인 경우를 구하기 위해, \( 2^{24} \)를 \( n \)번째 제곱으로 표현할 수 있는 조건을 살펴보았다. 

\( 2^{24} \)를 \( n \)번째 제곱으로 표현할 수 있는 경우, \( k^n = 2^{24} \)를 만족하는 정수 \( k \)가 존재해야 한다. 이때 \( k \)는 \( 2^m \) 형태의 수여야 하며, \( (2^m)^n = 2^{24} \)이어야 한다. 이는 \( m \times n = 24 \)를 의미한다. 따라서 \( m = \frac{24}{n} \)이 정수여야 하기 때문에, \( n \)은 24의 약수여야 한다.

24의 약수는 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24이다. 문제에서 \( n > 1 \)이기 때문에 1을 제외하고, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24까지 총 7개가 있다.

따라서, \( 2^{24} \)가 완전한 \( n^{\text{th}} \) 제곱인 \( n \)의 개수는 7개이다.

"힐러리가 가지고 있는 동전은 10센트짜리와 5센트짜리로 총 11개이며, 이들의 총 가치는 75센트입니다. 이 문제를 해결하기 위해 다음과 같이 접근할 수 있습니다.

먼저, 10센트짜리 동전의 개수를 x, 5센트짜리 동전의 개수를 y로 설정합니다. 그러면 총 개수는 x + y = 11이 됩니다. 또한, 총 가치는 10x + 5y = 75센트입니다.

이제 첫 번째 방정식을 통해 y를 x로 표현할 수 있습니다: y = 11 - x. 이 값을 두 번째 방정식에 대입하면 10x + 5(11 - x) = 75가 됩니다. 이를 풀어보면 10x + 55 - 5x = 75, 즉 5x = 20이므로 x = 4입니다. 따라서 y = 11 - 4 = 7입니다.

따라서 힐러리가 가지고 있는 5센트짜리 동전의 개수는 7개입니다.

"좋아, 이 문제를 풀기 위해 먼저 폴과 제시가 선택할 수 있는 소수 목록을 정리해 봅시다. 처음 여섯 개의 소수는 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13이죠. 총 6개의 소수가 있습니다.

폴과 제시는 각각 이 중에서 무작위로 하나씩 선택합니다. 그래서 폴이 선택할 수 있는 방법은 6가지, 제시도 6가지입니다. 따라서 총 경우의 수는 6 × 6 = 36가지입니다.

이제, 그들이 선택한 숫자의 합이 짝수일 확률을 구해야 합니다. 합이 짝수인 경우는 두 수가 모두 짝수이거나 모두 홀수일 때입니다. 그런데 주의할 점은 소수 중에서 2는 유일한 짝수 소수입니다. 나머지 3, 5, 7, 11, 13는 모두 홀수입니다.

먼저, 폴이 2를 선택하고 제시도 2를 선택하는 경우입니다. 이 경우 합은 2 + 2 = 4, 짝수입니다. 이 경우의 수는 1 × 1 = 1가지입니다.

다음으로, 폴이 홀수 소수를 선택하고 제시도 홀수 소수를 선택하는 경우입니다. 폴이 홀수 소수를 선택할 수 있는 방법은 5가지(3,5,7,11,13), 제시도 5가지입니다. 그래서 이 경우의 수는 5 × 5 = 25가지입니다.

합이 짝수인 총 경우의 수는 1 + 25 = 26가지입니다. 그래서 확률은 26/36입니다. 이 분수를 단순화하면 13/18이 됩니다.

따라서, 확률은 13/18입니다.

2. **합이 짝수인 경우**:
   - 두 수 모두 짝수이거나 모두 홀수일 때 합이 짝수입니다.
   - 소수 중에서 유일한 짝수는 2입니다.
   - **경우 1**: 폴이 2를 선택하고 제시도 2를 선택합니다.
     - 경우의 수: \(1 \times 1 = 1\)가지
   - **경우 2**: 폴이 홀수 소수를 선택하고 제시도 홀수 소수를 선택합니다.
     - 홀수 소수는 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 총 5개입니다.
     - 경우의 수: \(5 \times 5 = 25\)가지
   - **합이 짝수인 총 경우의 수**: \(1 + 25 = 26\)가지

3. **확률 계산**:
   - 확률 = \(\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}\)

먼저, 450을 소인수 분해합니다. 450 = 2 × 3² × 5²입니다. 따라서, 찾는 수는 2, 3², 5²의 배수이어야 합니다.

1. **2와 5²(25)의 배수 조건**:
   - 25의 배수는 끝자리가 00, 25, 50, 75 중 하나이지만, 모든 자릿수가 0과 1로만 이루어져야 하므로 끝자리가 00이어야 합니다.
   - 또한, 2의 배수이기 위해 마지막 자릿수가 0이어야 합니다. 따라서, 수는 00으로 끝나야 합니다.

2. **3²(9)의 배수 조건**:
   - 모든 자릿수의 합이 9의 배수이어야 합니다. 예를 들어, 11100의 자릿수 합은 1+1+1+0+0=3, 11111100의 자릿수 합은 1+1+1+1+1+1+0+0=6, 11111111100의 자릿수 합은 9입니다.

"Okay, so I have this fraction, 4321 over 5 to the 7th power times 2 to the 8th power. I need to find the sum of the digits in its finite decimal representation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that a fraction will have a finite decimal representation if the denominator, after simplifying the fraction, has no prime factors other than 2 and 5. In this case, the denominator is already 5^7 * 2^8, so that's good—it should convert to a finite decimal.

Now, to convert the fraction into a decimal, I need to make sure the denominator is a power of 10 because 10 is 2*5. So, the idea is to adjust the fraction so that the denominator becomes 10 raised to some power. 

Looking at the denominator, 5^7 * 2^8, I notice that 5^7 and 2^7 would make 10^7, but there's an extra 2^1 left. So, I can rewrite the denominator as 10^7 * 2^1, which is 10^7 * 2. That means the denominator is 2 * 10^7.

So, the fraction becomes 4321 divided by (2 * 10^7). I can separate this into two parts: 4321 divided by 2, and then divided by 10^7. Let me compute 4321 divided by 2 first.

4321 divided by 2 is 2160.5. Wait, that's a decimal. Hmm, maybe I should handle it differently. Alternatively, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 5 to make the denominator a power of 10. Let me try that.

The denominator is 5^7 * 2^8. If I multiply numerator and denominator by 5, the denominator becomes 5^8 * 2^8, which is (5*2)^8 = 10^8. So, the new fraction is (4321 * 5) / 10^8.

Calculating 4321 * 5: 4000*5 is 20,000, 300*5 is 1,500, 20*5 is 100, and 1*5 is 5. Adding those together: 20,000 + 1,500 is 21,500; 21,500 + 100 is 21,600; 21,600 + 5 is 21,605. So, the numerator becomes 21,605.

Therefore, the fraction is 21,605 / 10^8. To write this as a decimal, I move the decimal point eight places to the left. Starting from 21,605, which is 21605.0, moving the decimal eight places left would give me 0.21605000. Wait, let me count: 21605.0 becomes 0.21605000 when moving the decimal eight places. So, the decimal representation is 0.21605000.

But wait, 21,605 divided by 10^8 is 0.21605, but since 10^8 is 100,000,000, it's 0.21605000. So, the decimal is 0.21605000.

Now, I need to find the sum of each digit in this decimal. Let's write it out: 0.21605000. The digits after the decimal are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0.

So, adding them up: 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0. Let's compute that step by step.

2 + 1 is 3. 3 + 6 is 9. 9 + 0 is 9. 9 + 5 is 14. 14 + 0 is 14. 14 + 0 is 14. 14 + 0 is 14.

Wait, but hold on, the decimal is 0.21605000, so the digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0. So, adding those: 2 + 1 is 3, plus 6 is 9, plus 0 is 9, plus 5 is 14, plus 0 is 14, plus 0 is 14, plus 0 is 14. So, the sum is 14.

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes I might make a mistake in adding.

2 + 1 = 3

3 + 6 = 9

9 + 0 = 9

9 + 5 = 14

14 + 0 = 14

14 + 0 = 14

14 + 0 = 14

Yes, that seems correct. So, the sum of the digits is 14.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any digits. The decimal is 0.21605000, so counting each digit after the decimal:

1st digit: 2

2nd: 1

3rd: 6

4th: 0

5th: 5

6th: 0

7th: 0

8th: 0

Yes, that's eight digits. So, adding all eight digits: 2+1+6+0+5+0+0+0=14.

Therefore, the sum of the digits is 14.

But just to be thorough, let me verify the initial fraction conversion again.

Original fraction: 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8)

We multiplied numerator and denominator by 5 to get 4321*5=21605 and denominator becomes 5^8 * 2^8=10^8.

So, 21605 / 10^8 = 0.21605000.

Yes, that's correct. So, the decimal is 0.21605000, and the digits after the decimal are 2,1,6,0,5,0,0,0.

Sum is 2+1+6+0+5+0+0+0=14.

I think that's solid. So, the answer should be 14.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the digits is \boxed{14}.
</think>

To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

First, we note that the denominator \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) can be rewritten as \(10^7 \cdot 2\). To convert the fraction into a decimal, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 5, which gives us:

\[
\frac{4321 \times 5}{5^7 \cdot 2^8 \times 5} = \frac{21605}{10^8}
\]

This simplifies to the decimal \(0.21605000\).

Next, we sum the digits of this decimal. The digits after the decimal point are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0. Adding these together:

\[
2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 14
\]

Thus, the sum of the digits is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the product of sines: sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°. Hmm, that's a lot of sine terms multiplied together. I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using certain trigonometric identities or product formulas. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the angles are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, increasing by 20° each time. So, the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, and 160°. That's eight terms in total. Maybe there's a pattern or a symmetry here that I can exploit.

I recall that sin(180° - x) = sinx. So, let's see which of these angles are supplementary. For example, sin160° is equal to sin20°, because 160° = 180° - 20°. Similarly, sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, and sin100° = sin80°. So, that means:

sin160° = sin20°
sin140° = sin40°
sin120° = sin60°
sin100° = sin80°

So, substituting these into the original product, we can rewrite the product as:

sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin80° sin60° sin40° sin20°

Wait, that's interesting. So, the product becomes [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Because each of the first four terms is repeated again in the second half. So, the original product is the square of the product of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, and sin80°.

So, now the problem reduces to finding [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Maybe I can compute the product inside the square first and then square it.

I remember that there's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Let me recall. I think it's something like the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k=1 to n-1 is equal to n/(2^{n-1}). But wait, that's for angles in radians and specific cases. Maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, I remember that for multiple angles, sometimes using complex numbers or roots of unity can help, but that might be complicated. Alternatively, maybe using product-to-sum identities? But that might get messy with four terms.

Wait, another thought: I remember that sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4. Maybe that identity can help here. Let me check.

Let me test this identity with A = 20°. Then, sin20° sin40° sin80°. Let's compute sin20° sin40° sin80°.

Using the identity: sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.

So, if A = 20°, then sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4.

Wait, sin3A would be sin60°, which is √3/2. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = (√3/2)/4 = √3/8.

Wait, that's a useful result. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = √3/8.

But in our product, we have sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. So, that's [sin20° sin40° sin80°] * sin60°. We already know that sin20° sin40° sin80° is √3/8, so multiplying by sin60°, which is √3/2, gives:

(√3/8) * (√3/2) = (3/16).

So, sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = 3/16.

Therefore, the original product is [3/16]^2 = 9/256.

Wait, is that correct? Let me double-check.

First, let's verify the identity: sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.

Let me compute sin20° sin40° sin80°.

Compute sin20° sin40° sin80°:

Using the identity, A = 20°, so sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4 = (√3/2)/4 = √3/8. That seems correct.

Then, multiplying by sin60°, which is √3/2, gives (√3/8)*(√3/2) = (3/16). So, that's correct.

Therefore, the product inside the square is 3/16, so the original product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me think again. The original product is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°, which we rewrote as [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. But is that accurate?

Wait, let's list the angles again:

sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, sin160°.

We know that sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, sin140° = sin40°, sin160° = sin20°. So, substituting, the product becomes:

sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin80° sin60° sin40° sin20°.

Which is indeed [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.

So, yes, that's correct. Therefore, the product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me compute this numerically to check.

Compute sin20° ≈ 0.3420

sin40° ≈ 0.6428

sin60° ≈ 0.8660

sin80° ≈ 0.9848

sin100° ≈ 0.9848

sin120° ≈ 0.8660

sin140° ≈ 0.6428

sin160° ≈ 0.3420

Multiply all together:

0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198

0.2198 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1903

0.1903 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1879

0.1879 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1855

0.1855 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1607

0.1607 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.1033

0.1033 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0353

Now, 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625, which is very close to 0.0353. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the value is 9/256.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using the identity for multiple angles or product formulas.

Alternatively, I remember that the product of sines of equally spaced angles can be expressed using certain formulas. For example, the product sin(π/n) sin(2π/n)...sin((n-1)π/n) = n/(2^{n-1}).

But in this case, the angles are in degrees, and not necessarily in the form of π/n. Let me see.

Wait, 20° is π/9 radians, 40° is 2π/9, 60° is π/3, 80° is 4π/9, 100° is 5π/9, 120° is 2π/3, 140° is 7π/9, 160° is 8π/9.

So, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(π/3) sin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) sin(2π/3) sin(7π/9) sin(8π/9).

But since sin(π - x) = sinx, we can pair them as:

sin(π/9) sin(8π/9) = [sin(π/9)]^2

sin(2π/9) sin(7π/9) = [sin(2π/9)]^2

sin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) = [sin(4π/9)]^2

And then we have sin(π/3) and sin(2π/3), which are both √3/2.

So, the product becomes [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (√3/2)^2.

Wait, that's similar to what I did earlier. So, [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (3/4).

But I know that sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me recall. There's a formula that sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8. Let me verify that.

Yes, I think that's a known identity. So, if that's the case, then [3√3/8]^2 * (3/4) = (27/64) * (3/4) = 81/256.

Wait, but that contradicts my earlier result of 9/256. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Wait, let me compute [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (3/4).

If sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8, then squaring that gives (27/64), and multiplying by (3/4) gives 81/256.

But earlier, I got 9/256. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the earlier approach. Let me check.

In the first approach, I considered that the product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2, which I computed as (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

But in the second approach, using radians, I get 81/256.

But numerically, when I computed the product, I got approximately 0.0353, which is close to 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625, but 81/256 ≈ 0.3164, which is much larger. So, that can't be.

Wait, so perhaps the second approach is incorrect. Let me see.

Wait, in the second approach, I considered the product as [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * (√3/2)^2.

But actually, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(π/3) sin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) sin(2π/3) sin(7π/9) sin(8π/9).

But sin(5π/9) = sin(4π/9), sin(7π/9) = sin(2π/9), sin(8π/9) = sin(π/9). So, the product is [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * [sin(π/3) sin(2π/3)].

But sin(π/3) = sin(2π/3) = √3/2, so their product is (√3/2)^2 = 3/4.

So, the product is [sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9)]^2 * 3/4.

If sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(4π/9) = 3√3/8, then the product is (27/64) * 3/4 = 81/256.

But earlier, I thought the product was [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 = (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

But numerically, the product is approximately 0.0353, which is close to 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625.

So, which one is correct? There must be a mistake in one of the approaches.

"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out what shape the equation \( z = c \) represents in cylindrical coordinates. The options are straight line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point is defined by these three components.

The equation given is \( z = c \). That means, for any point in space, the z-coordinate is fixed at the constant value \( c \). I need to visualize what this looks like. If I fix the z-coordinate, what does that represent geometrically?

In Cartesian coordinates, if I have \( z = c \), that's a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But wait, in cylindrical coordinates, does this change anything? I don't think so because the z-coordinate is the same in both systems. So, regardless of \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is fixed, the shape should still be a plane.

Let me double-check. In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) can vary from 0 to infinity, \( \theta \) can go from 0 to \( 2\pi \), and \( z \) is fixed. So, for every possible \( r \) and \( \theta \), the point is somewhere on the plane \( z = c \). That makes sense because it's not restricting \( r \) or \( \theta \), just fixing \( z \).

Wait, could it be a cylinder? No, because a cylinder in cylindrical coordinates would have a fixed \( r \), like \( r = c \). Similarly, a cone would have \( z \) proportional to \( r \), like \( z = kr \) for some constant \( k \). A sphere would involve all three coordinates, probably something like \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \). A circle would be in a plane with fixed \( z \) and fixed \( r \), but here \( r \) isn't fixed. A straight line would require more constraints, like both \( r \) and \( \theta \) being fixed or something.

So, yeah, since \( z \) is fixed and \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary freely, it's a plane. Therefore, the answer should be (C) 평면.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is the magnitudes of a and b, which are 2 and 7 respectively, and their cross product, which is the vector (3, 2, 6). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors has a magnitude equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can set up an equation to solve for sinθ, and then find θ.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector. The cross product is (3, 2, 6), so its magnitude is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 is 13, plus 36 is 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49), which is 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.

Now, plugging into the formula: 7 = ||a|| ||b|| sinθ. We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so that becomes 7 = 2 * 7 * sinθ. Simplifying the right side: 2*7 is 14, so 7 = 14 sinθ. Dividing both sides by 14 gives sinθ = 7/14, which simplifies to sinθ = 1/2.

Alright, so sinθ is 1/2. Now, I need to find the angle θ where sine is 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) is 1/2, and sin(150°) is also 1/2. But since we're looking for the smallest possible angle between the vectors, it should be the acute angle, which is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cross product magnitude is 7, and the product of the magnitudes is 2*7=14. So 7/14 is indeed 1/2. So sinθ is 1/2, which corresponds to 30° and 150°. Since we want the smallest angle, 30° is the answer.

But hold on, is there any possibility that the angle could be smaller? I don't think so because the sine function reaches 1/2 at 30°, and beyond that, it starts decreasing again. So 30° is the smallest angle where sinθ is 1/2. Therefore, the smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is 30 degrees.

I think that's it. Let me just recap: cross product magnitude gives me sinθ, which is 1/2, leading to θ being 30°, which is the smallest possible angle. Yeah, that makes sense.

**Final Answer**
The smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta\), we substitute the known values:
\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin \theta
\]
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is either \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are looking for the smallest angle, we choose \(30^\circ\).

Thus, the smallest possible angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a function f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015, and another function g(x) which is defined as f(x + 5). I need to find the sum of the roots of g(x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for any polynomial, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial like f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, for f(x), the sum of the roots would be 49/1, which is 49. But wait, that's for f(x). I need the sum of the roots for g(x), which is f(x + 5). How does shifting the function affect the roots?

Let me recall that if you have a function g(x) = f(x + h), then the graph of g is the graph of f shifted h units to the left. So, if f(x) has roots at x = r1, r2, r3, then g(x) will have roots at x = r1 - h, r2 - h, r3 - h. That makes sense because if you plug x = r1 - h into g(x), you get f((r1 - h) + h) = f(r1) = 0.

So, if the roots of f(x) are r1, r2, r3, then the roots of g(x) are r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r1 - 5) + (r2 - 5) + (r3 - 5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) - 15.

From earlier, I know that the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49. So, substituting that in, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be 49 - 15 = 34. Is that right? Let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe I can find g(x) explicitly and then use Vieta's formula on it. Let's try that approach to confirm.

Given that g(x) = f(x + 5), so I need to substitute x + 5 into f(x). Let's compute each term step by step.

First, f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let me expand each term:

1. (x + 5)³: I know that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So, (x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

2. -49(x + 5)²: First, expand (x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25. Then multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225.

3. 623(x + 5): That's 623x + 3115.

4. -2015: That's just a constant term.

Now, let's combine all these terms together:

g(x) = (x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.

Now, let's combine like terms:

- The x³ term: 1x³.

- The x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².

- The x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 is 208. So, 208x.

- The constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, so g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. Hmm, so it's a cubic polynomial with leading coefficient 1, and the coefficient of x² is -34. Therefore, using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. That matches my earlier result.

So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.

Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in expanding, let me go through the expansion again quickly.

(x + 5)³: x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125. Correct.

-49(x + 5)²: -49(x² + 10x + 25) = -49x² - 490x - 1225. Correct.

623(x + 5): 623x + 3115. Correct.

Adding all together:

x³ +15x² +75x +125 -49x² -490x -1225 +623x +3115 -2015.

Combine x³: x³.

x²: 15 -49 = -34.

x: 75 -490 +623 = 75 + (623 -490) = 75 + 133 = 208.

Constants: 125 -1225 +3115 -2015.

125 -1225 = -1100.

-1100 +3115 = 2015.

2015 -2015 = 0.

Yes, that's correct. So, g(x) is indeed x³ -34x² +208x, and the sum of its roots is 34.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that shifting the function horizontally doesn't change the shape of the graph, just its position. So, the roots are shifted, but their sum changes by the amount shifted times the number of roots. Since it's a cubic, there are three roots, each shifted by -5, so the total shift in the sum is -15, leading to 49 -15 =34. That also makes sense.

I think I'm confident now that 34 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the roots of \( g \) is \boxed{34}.
</think>

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \).

First, we recognize that the sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the sum of the roots is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) term divided by the coefficient of \( x^3 \) term, which is \( \frac{49}{1} = 49 \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted by -5. If the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15
\]

Given that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[
49 - 15 = 34
\]

To confirm, we can expand \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \):

\[
f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Expanding each term:

1. \( (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 \)
2. \( -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225 \)
3. \( 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115 \)
4. The constant term is -2015.

Combining all terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015
\]

Simplifying:

- The \( x^3 \) term: \( x^3 \)
- The \( x^2 \) terms: \( 15x^2 - 49x^2 = -34x^2 \)
- The \( x \) terms: \( 75x - 490x + 623x = 208x \)
- The constant terms: \( 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015 = 0 \)

Thus, \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \). Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is \( \frac{34}{1} = 34 \).

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"Okay, so I have this expression to compute: \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}\) is the same as \(\sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\) is \(\csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

I wonder if there are any trigonometric identities that relate these terms. I know that \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\) and \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\). Maybe substituting these in could simplify things.

So, substituting, the expression becomes:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Simplifying the constants, that's \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\), so now we have:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly. Maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that sometimes, when dealing with multiple angles, using complementary angles or some addition formulas might be useful.

Looking at the angles: 10°, 20°, and 40°. I notice that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, but I don't see an immediate pattern. Wait, 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are related through doubling angles. Maybe that's a clue.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\) or something similar? Let me recall that \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\). Maybe that could be useful if I can relate these angles somehow.

Wait, 10°, 20°, and 40° are all related through doubling: 10°, 20° is 2*10°, 40° is 2*20°, and 80° is 2*40°, but I don't know if that's directly helpful here.

Another thought: Maybe using the identity for \(\tan(A + B)\) or \(\tan(A - B)\). Let me see if I can express some of these terms in terms of others.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that relates \(\tan \theta\) and \(\cot \theta\). Since \(\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)\), so maybe I can express all terms in terms of tangent.

Let me try that. So, \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). So, substituting back into the expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, so now I have three tangent squared terms: 10°, 50°, and 70°. I wonder if there's a relationship between these angles. Let me note that 10° + 50° = 60°, and 50° + 70° = 120°, but not sure if that helps.

Wait, 10°, 50°, and 70° are all related to 60°, which is a nice angle. Maybe I can use some identity involving 60°. Let me think about the tangent addition formula.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that for angles adding up to 90°, their tangents multiply to 1. For example, \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 80^\circ = 1\), but 80° isn't directly in our expression. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: Maybe using the identity that \(\tan^2 \theta + \tan^2 (60^\circ - \theta) + \tan^2 (60^\circ + \theta) = 9\). Is that a real identity? Let me check for a specific angle.

Let me test it with \(\theta = 10^\circ\). Then, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ\). Wait, that's exactly the terms I have! So, if this identity holds, then the sum would be 9. Let me verify this.

I think the identity is indeed \(\tan^2 \theta + \tan^2 (60^\circ - \theta) + \tan^2 (60^\circ + \theta) = 9\). Let me see if that's correct.

Let me compute each term for \(\theta = 10^\circ\):

- \(\tan 10^\circ \approx 0.1763\), so \(\tan^2 10^\circ \approx 0.0311\)
- \(\tan 50^\circ \approx 1.191753592\), so \(\tan^2 50^\circ \approx 1.420\)
- \(\tan 70^\circ \approx 2.747477\), so \(\tan^2 70^\circ \approx 7.548\)

Adding them up: 0.0311 + 1.420 + 7.548 ≈ 9.0. Wow, that's exactly 9. So, the identity holds for \(\theta = 10^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of these three tangent squared terms is 9.

So, going back to our expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ = 3 + 9 = 12
\]

Wait, hold on. Wait, no. Wait, in the expression, we have \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ\), which is 9, so adding the 3 gives 12. But wait, let me double-check.

Wait, no, the original expression after substitution was:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

But then I converted \(\cot 20^\circ\) to \(\tan 70^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) to \(\tan 50^\circ\), so the expression becomes:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

Which is 3 + 9 = 12. So, the total expression is 12.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. Let me go back step by step.

Original expression:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

Which is:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Expressed in terms of tangent and cotangent:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Then, since \(\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)\), so:

\[
\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ
\]
\[
\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ
\]

So substituting back:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

And as per the identity, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9\), so total is 3 + 9 = 12.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is 12.

Wait, but let me verify this with another approach to be sure. Maybe using another identity or calculating numerically.

Let me compute each term numerically:

1. \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\):

First, \(\cos 10^\circ \approx 0.984807753\), so \(\cos^2 10^\circ \approx 0.96984631\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{0.96984631} \approx 1.03112889\).

2. \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}\):

\(\sin 20^\circ \approx 0.342020143\), so \(\sin^2 20^\circ \approx 0.116977778\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{0.116977778} \approx 8.555723205\).

3. \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\):

\(\sin 40^\circ \approx 0.6427876097\), so \(\sin^2 40^\circ \approx 0.4131759112\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{0.4131759112} \approx 2.420352248\).

Now, adding them up:

1.03112889 + 8.555723205 + 2.420352248 ≈ 1.0311 + 8.5557 + 2.4204 ≈ 12.0072.

Hmm, that's approximately 12.0072, which is very close to 12. Considering the approximations in the decimal places, it's likely that the exact value is 12.

Therefore, the expression evaluates to 12.

Another way to think about it: Maybe using the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\). Let me recall that:

\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]

If I set \(\theta = 10^\circ\), then \(3\theta = 30^\circ\), and \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\). So, plugging in:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}
\]

Let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\). Then:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3t^2) = 3(3t - t^3)
\]

Expanding both sides:

Left side: \(\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3} t^2\)

Right side: \(9t - 3t^3\)

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3} t^2 - 9t + 3t^3 = 0
\]

Divide both sides by 3:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} - \sqrt{3} t^2 - 3t + t^3 = 0
\]

Rearranged:

\[
t^3 - \sqrt{3} t^2 - 3t + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3} = 0
\]

Hmm, not sure if this helps directly, but maybe if I can find a relationship between \(t = \tan 10^\circ\), \(u = \tan 50^\circ\), and \(v = \tan 70^\circ\). Since 10°, 50°, and 70° are related through 60°, perhaps their tangents satisfy some cubic equation.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity that \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 50^\circ \tan 70^\circ = \tan 30^\circ\). Wait, is that true?

Let me check:

\(\tan 10^\circ \approx 0.1763\), \(\tan 50^\circ \approx 1.191753592\), \(\tan 70^\circ \approx 2.747477\).

Multiplying them: 0.1763 * 1.191753592 ≈ 0.21, then 0.21 * 2.747477 ≈ 0.577. And \(\tan","[0.577000000000000, '0.577']",12,"[12, '12']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find a unique odd integer t such that 0 < t < 23, and t + 2 is the modular inverse of t modulo 23. Hmm, let me try to understand what this means.

First, modular inverse. If t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23, that means when I multiply t by t + 2, the result should be congruent to 1 modulo 23. In other words, t*(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. So, I can write that as an equation:

t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23.

Expanding that, it becomes:

t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23.

Let me rearrange this equation to make it a standard quadratic equation:

t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.

So, I need to solve this quadratic congruence equation modulo 23. Since 23 is a prime number, I can use some methods from number theory to solve this.

One approach is to complete the square. Let me try that. The equation is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. To complete the square, I can write it as:

t² + 2t + 1 ≡ 2 mod 23.

Because I added 1 to both sides to complete the square. So, (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23.

Now, I need to find t such that (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23. This means that t + 1 is a square root of 2 modulo 23. So, I need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23.

I remember that for a prime modulus p, if a is a quadratic residue modulo p, then it has two square roots. So, I need to find integers x such that x² ≡ 2 mod 23.

Let me try to compute the squares modulo 23 to see which numbers squared give 2.

Let me list the squares of numbers from 1 to 11 modulo 23 because beyond 11, the squares will repeat due to symmetry (since (23 - x)² ≡ x² mod 23).

1² = 1 mod 23
2² = 4 mod 23
3² = 9 mod 23
4² = 16 mod 23
5² = 25 ≡ 2 mod 23. Oh, wait, 5² is 25, which is 2 mod 23. So, 5 is a square root of 2 mod 23.

Similarly, since 23 - 5 = 18, 18² should also be 2 mod 23. Let me check: 18² = 324. Dividing 324 by 23: 23*14=322, so 324 - 322 = 2. Yes, 18² ≡ 2 mod 23.

So, the square roots of 2 mod 23 are 5 and 18.

Therefore, t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 or t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23.

Solving for t:

Case 1: t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 4 mod 23.

Case 2: t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 17 mod 23.

So, the solutions are t ≡ 4 or 17 mod 23.

But the problem states that t must be an odd integer. Let's check the values:

t ≡ 4 mod 23: 4 is even, so this doesn't satisfy the condition.

t ≡ 17 mod 23: 17 is odd, so this is a valid solution.

Since 0 < t < 23, the only possible value is t = 17.

Wait, let me double-check. If t = 17, then t + 2 = 19. Is 19 the inverse of 17 mod 23?

Let me compute 17*19 mod 23.

17*19 = 323. Now, divide 323 by 23: 23*14 = 322, so 323 - 322 = 1. So, 17*19 ≡ 1 mod 23. Yes, that's correct.

Therefore, t = 17 is the unique odd integer satisfying the given conditions.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't skip anything.

1. Set up the equation t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23.
2. Expanded to t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.
3. Completed the square to get (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23.
4. Found that 5 and 18 are square roots of 2 mod 23.
5. Solved for t, getting t ≡ 4 or 17 mod 23.
6. Checked which of these are odd: 17 is odd, 4 is even.
7. Verified that t = 17 satisfies the original condition.

Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that t = 17 is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The unique odd integer \( t \) is \boxed{17}.
</think>

Given \(0 < t < 23\) and \(t + 2\) is the modular inverse of \(t\) modulo 23, we need to find the unique odd integer \(t\).

First, we know that if \(t + 2\) is the modular inverse of \(t\) modulo 23, then:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we complete the square:
\[ t^2 + 2t + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ (t + 1)^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23. Checking the squares of numbers from 1 to 11 modulo 23, we find:
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the square roots of 2 modulo 23 are 5 and 18. Therefore:
\[ t + 1 \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t + 1 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \]

Solving for \(t\):
- If \(t + 1 \equiv 5 \pmod{23}\), then \(t \equiv 4 \pmod{23}\).
- If \(t + 1 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}\), then \(t \equiv 17 \pmod{23}\).

Since \(t\) must be an odd integer, we check the solutions:
- \(t = 4\) is even.
- \(t = 17\) is odd.

Verifying, we find that \(17 \times 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}\), confirming that 19 is indeed the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23.

Thus, the unique odd integer \(t\) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is \(x\). Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the inverse cotangent function, giving an angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\). I wonder if there's a relationship between these two functions that I can use here.

Wait, I recall that \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) for positive \(y\). So, if I let \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Is that right? Let me check with an example. If \(x = 1\), then \(\cot^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so yes, that seems correct. So, in this case, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). That simplifies things a bit.

So, substituting that into the original equation, I get:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Which simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Alright, so now I have \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). I remember the double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin\theta \cos\theta\). So, substituting that in, I get:
\[
2\sin\theta \cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}
\]
But I also know that \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so I can express \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of \(x\). Let me draw a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, so that \(\tan\theta = x/1 = x\). Then, the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\).

Therefore, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Plugging these into the equation:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
So, that gives:
\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[
2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)
\]
Which simplifies to:
\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]
Bringing all terms to one side:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]
This is a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Plugging in the values:
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]
Simplifying \(\sqrt{32}\) as \(4\sqrt{2}\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]
So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

But wait, I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be restrictions on the domain or range.

Let me consider the original equation again:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
We found that \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 2\tan^{-1}(x)\). But is this always true?

Wait, actually, I think I made a mistake earlier. Let me double-check that step. I said that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), but is that always the case?

I know that \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) when \(y > 0\). So, if \(x > 0\), then \(\frac{1}{x} > 0\), and the identity holds. However, if \(x < 0\), then \(\frac{1}{x} < 0\), and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) would be in a different range.

Wait, actually, the range of \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is usually \((0, \pi)\), similar to \(\tan^{-1}(y)\) which is \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\). So, if \(y\) is positive, \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is in \((0, \frac{\pi}{2})\), and if \(y\) is negative, it's in \((\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)\). Similarly, \(\tan^{-1}(y)\) is in \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\), so for negative \(y\), it's in \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, 0)\).

So, if \(x\) is positive, then \(\frac{1}{x}\) is positive, and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). But if \(x\) is negative, then \(\frac{1}{x}\) is negative, and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) would be in \((\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)\), whereas \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) would be in \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, 0)\). So, in that case, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \neq \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Therefore, my earlier substitution only holds when \(x > 0\). If \(x < 0\), I need to adjust the equation accordingly.

So, let's consider two cases: \(x > 0\) and \(x < 0\).

**Case 1: \(x > 0\)**

As before, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation becomes:
\[
\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Which leads to the quadratic equation and solutions \(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(x > 0\), both solutions are positive because \(3 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 5.828\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2} \approx 0.172\), both positive. So, both are valid in this case.

**Case 2: \(x < 0\)**

Here, \(\frac{1}{x}\) is negative, so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is in \((\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)\). Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Since \(x < 0\), \(\theta\) is in \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, 0)\). Let me also denote \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), which is in \((\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)\).

I need to find \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\). Let me see if I can express \(\phi\) in terms of \(\theta\).

Since \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), and \(x < 0\), let me set \(x = -a\) where \(a > 0\). Then, \(\frac{1}{x} = -\frac{1}{a}\), so \(\phi = \cot^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{a}\right)\). I know that \(\cot^{-1}(-y) = \pi - \cot^{-1}(y)\) for \(y > 0\). So, \(\phi = \pi - \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{a}\right)\).

But \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{a}\right) = \tan^{-1}(a)\), so \(\phi = \pi - \tan^{-1}(a)\). Since \(a = -x\), and \(x < 0\), \(a > 0\). Therefore, \(\phi = \pi - \tan^{-1}(-x)\).

But \(\tan^{-1}(-x) = -\tan^{-1}(x)\), so \(\phi = \pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, is that correct? Let me check.

Wait, \(\tan^{-1}(-x) = -\tan^{-1}(x)\), so \(\phi = \pi - (-\tan^{-1}(x)) = \pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\). Hmm, but \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is negative because \(x < 0\), so \(\pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\) would be in \((\pi - \frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)\), which is \((\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi)\), which matches the range of \(\phi\). So, that seems correct.

Therefore, \(\phi = \pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the sum \(\theta + \phi\) is:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \pi + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2\tan^{-1}(x) + \pi
\]
So, the original equation becomes:
\[
\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x) + \pi) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
But \(\sin(\alpha + \pi) = -\sin\alpha\), so:
\[
-\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Which implies:
\[
\sin(2\tan^{-1}(x)) = -\frac{1}{3}
\]
So, similar to before, let me set \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = -\frac{1}{3}
\]
Again, using the double-angle identity:
\[
2\sin\theta \cos\theta = -\frac{1}{3}
\]
Expressing \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of \(x\). Since \(x < 0\), let me represent \(x = -a\) where \(a > 0\). Then, \(\tan\theta = x = -a\), so in the right triangle, the opposite side is \(-a\) (but since lengths are positive, we can consider the magnitude), adjacent side is 1, hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{a^2 + 1}\).

Therefore, \(\sin\theta = \frac{-a}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}}\). Plugging into the equation:
\[
2 \cdot \left( \frac{-a}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + 1}} \right) = -\frac{1}{3}
\]
Simplifying:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{-a}{a^2 + 1} = -\frac{1}{3}
\]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[
2 \cdot \frac{a}{a^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Which is the same equation as in the positive case:
\[
\frac{2a}{a^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[
6a = a^2 + 1
\]
Bringing all terms to one side:
\[
a^2 - 6a + 1 = 0
\]
Solving this quadratic equation:
\[
a = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]
Since \(a > 0\), both solutions are valid because \(3 + 2\sqrt{2} > 0\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2} \approx 0.172 > 0\). Therefore, \(a = 3 + ","[3, '3 + ']",3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2},"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. Both lines are given in parametric form, which is good because I remember that parametric equations are pretty straightforward for lines. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.

The first line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
And the second line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Hmm, the problem says they are parallel, which makes sense because the direction vectors look like they might be scalar multiples of each other. Let me check that. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which is exactly the direction vector of the second line. So yes, they are parallel because their direction vectors are scalar multiples (specifically, multiplied by 2). That means the lines don't intersect and are indeed parallel, so the distance between them should be constant.

Now, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember that the formula involves taking a vector connecting any two points on the lines and then projecting it onto a vector that's perpendicular to the direction of the lines. The length of this projection gives the distance. Alternatively, I think the formula is something like the magnitude of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting the two points, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Let me recall the exact formula.

I think the distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be calculated using the formula:
\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|}
\]
where \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the lines, and \(\vec{w}\) is the vector connecting any two points on the two lines.

So, let me define the points on each line. Let's take the points when the parameters \(t\) and \(u\) are zero. For the first line, when \(t = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). For the second line, when \(u = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). So, the vector connecting these two points is:
\[
\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Okay, so \(\vec{w}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\). The direction vector \(\vec{v}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) from the first line. Since the lines are parallel, I can use either direction vector, but since the second one is just a multiple, it might be simpler to use the first one.

Now, I need to compute the cross product of \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\). Let me write that out. The cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\) is calculated as:
\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 \\ v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 \\ v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Plugging in the values:
- \(v_1 = 2\), \(v_2 = -9\), \(v_3 = -2\)
- \(w_1 = -8\), \(w_2 = 7\), \(w_3 = 5\)

So, computing each component:
1. First component: \(v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 = (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) = -45 + 14 = -31\)
2. Second component: \(v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 = (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6\)
3. Third component: \(v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 = (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) = 14 - 72 = -58\)

So, the cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\) is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product. The magnitude \(|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364}
\]
Calculating each term:
- \((-31)^2 = 961\)
- \(6^2 = 36\)
- \((-58)^2 = 3364\)

Adding them up: \(961 + 36 = 997\), then \(997 + 3364 = 4361\). So, the magnitude is \(\sqrt{4361}\).

Wait, let me check that addition again. 961 + 36 is indeed 997, and 997 + 3364. Let me compute 997 + 3364:

997 + 3000 = 3997

3997 + 364 = 4361. Yes, that's correct.

So, \(|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}| = \sqrt{4361}\). Hmm, I wonder if 4361 is a perfect square. Let me check. 66 squared is 4356, which is close. 66^2 = 4356, so 4361 is 66^2 + 5, which is 4356 + 5 = 4361. So, it's not a perfect square. So, I'll just leave it as \(\sqrt{4361}\) for now.

Next, I need the magnitude of the direction vector \(\vec{v}\). The direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so its magnitude is:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]
So, \(|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{89}\).

Now, plugging these into the distance formula:
\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}}
\]
I can simplify this by rationalizing or combining the square roots:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}}
\]
Let me compute 4361 divided by 89. Let's see, 89 times 49 is 4361 because 89*50=4450, which is 89 more than 4361. So, 4450 - 89 = 4361, so 89*49=4361. Therefore, \(\frac{4361}{89} = 49\). So, the square root of 49 is 7.

Wait, that's a nice simplification! So, \(d = \sqrt{49} = 7\).

Wait, let me verify that division again. 89 times 49: 89*40=3560, 89*9=801, so 3560+801=4361. Yes, that's correct. So, 4361 divided by 89 is indeed 49, so the square root is 7.

Therefore, the distance between the two parallel lines is 7 units.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations, let me go through the steps again.

1. Identified the direction vectors and confirmed they are scalar multiples (2 times), so lines are parallel.
2. Took points when parameters are zero: (3, -10, 1) and (-5, -3, 6).
3. Calculated the vector connecting these points: (-8, 7, 5).
4. Computed the cross product of direction vector (2, -9, -2) and connecting vector (-8, 7, 5):
   - First component: (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) = -45 +14 = -31
   - Second component: (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 -10 = 6
   - Third component: (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) =14 -72 = -58
   So, cross product is (-31, 6, -58)
5. Calculated the magnitude of cross product: sqrt(961 + 36 + 3364) = sqrt(4361)
6. Calculated magnitude of direction vector: sqrt(4 + 81 +4) = sqrt(89)
7. Divided the two magnitudes: sqrt(4361)/sqrt(89) = sqrt(49) =7

Everything seems to check out. So, I think the distance is indeed 7.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the two parallel lines is \boxed{7}.
</think>

The first line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The second line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which are scalar multiples, confirming the lines are parallel.

To find the distance between the lines, we use the formula involving the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting points on the lines. The points on the lines when parameters are zero are \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The connecting vector is:
\[
\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\) is calculated as:
\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The magnitude of this cross product is:
\[
|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\vec{v}\) is:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{89}
\]

The distance \(d\) is:
\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Thus, the distance between the two parallel lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"좋아, 이 문제는 주어진 직사각형 영역의 내부에 엄격히 포함되는 정수 좌표의 점의 개수를 구하는 문제입니다. 주어진 꼭짓점은 (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), (5,-4)입니다. 먼저, 이 직사각형의 모양을 그려보고, 그 내부에 있는 정수 좌표를 어떻게 세어야 할지 생각해 봅시다.

먼저, 직사각형의 꼭짓점을 보면, x좌표는 5와 -5, y좌표는 4와 -4입니다. 그래서 이 직사각형은 x축을 기준으로 대칭이고, y축을 기준으로도 대칭인 것 같습니다. 직사각형의 길이와 너비를 계산해 보겠습니다.

x축 방향으로는 5에서 -5까지이기 때문에 길이는 5 - (-5) = 10입니다. y축 방향으로는 4에서 -4까지이기 때문에 너비는 4 - (-4) = 8입니다. 그래서 직사각형의 크기는 10x8입니다.

하지만 이 직사각형은 내부에 엄격히 포함되는 점을 세어야 합니다. 즉, 경계선 위에 있는 점은 포함하지 않습니다. 그래서 x좌표는 -5 < x < 5, y좌표는 -4 < y < 4인 정수 좌표를 찾는 것입니다.

x좌표의 경우, -5 < x < 5이기 때문에 x는 -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4입니다. 총 9개의 값이 있습니다.

y좌표의 경우, -4 < y < 4이기 때문에 y는 -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3입니다. 총 7개의 값이 있습니다.

이제, x좌표와 y좌표의 조합으로 내부에 있는 점의 개수를 구합니다. x좌표의 개수는 9개, y좌표의 개수는 7개이기 때문에 9 × 7 = 63개의 점이 있습니다.

하지만, 이 때 주의할 점은, 직사각형이 정사각형이 아니라 길쭉한 직사각형이기 때문에, x와 y의 범위가 다르기 때문에 각각의 범위를 정확히 계산하는 것이 중요합니다. 예를 들어, x좌표는 -5에서 5까지이지만, 엄격히 포함이기 때문에 -5와 5는 제외합니다. 마찬가지로 y좌표도 -4와 4는 제외합니다.

또한, 이 문제는 정수 좌표만을 고려하므로, 실수 좌표는 전혀 고려하지 않습니다. 따라서, x와 y가 모두 정수인 점만을 세어야 합니다.

이제, x좌표의 경우, -4부터 4까지의 정수는 총 9개입니다. (-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). y좌표의 경우, -3부터 3까지의 정수는 총 7개입니다. (-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3).

따라서, 내부에 있는 정수 좌표의 점의 개수는 9 × 7 = 63개입니다.

하지만, 혹시나 실수로 경계선을 포함한 점을 세는 경우가 있을까봐 다시 한번 확인해 봅니다. 예를 들어, x=5, y=4는 경계에 있는 점이기 때문에 포함하지 않습니다. 마찬가지로 x=-5, y=-4도 포함하지 않습니다. 따라서, x좌표는 -4부터 4까지, y좌표는 -3부터 3까지의 정수만을 포함합니다.

또한, 이 직사각형은 x축과 y축을 기준으로 대칭이기 때문에, 각 사분면에 있는 점의 개수가 같을 것입니다. 예를 들어, x>0, y>0인 영역에 있는 점의 개수는 (4 × 3) = 12개입니다. 이는 4개의 사분면에 걸쳐 12 × 4 = 48개의 점이 있을 수 있지만, 이는 중간에 x=0이나 y=0을 포함하지 않기 때문에, 중간에 있는 점을 포함하지 않으면서, x=0과 y=0을 포함하는 점도 있습니다. 그래서, 이 방법으로는 좀 더 복잡해질 수 있습니다. 그래서, 처음에 생각한 방법이 더 간단하고 정확합니다.

따라서, x좌표 9개, y좌표 7개, 총 63개의 점이 내부에 엄격히 포함됩니다.
</think>

주어진 직사각형의 내부에 엄격히 포함되는 정수 좌표의 점의 개수는 x좌표가 -4부터 4까지 9개, y좌표가 -3부터 3까지 7개로, 9 × 7 = 63개입니다.

"Okay, so I have this vector problem here, and I need to compute the cross product of (2b - a) and (3c + a). Hmm, cross products can be a bit tricky, but I think I remember some properties that might help me here. Let me jot down what I know.

First, the problem gives me three cross products:

1. a × b = [6, -7, 3]
2. a × c = [4, 7, 2]
3. b × c = [1, -7, 18]

And I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, cross product is distributive over vector addition, right? So maybe I can expand this expression using the distributive property. Let me recall the formula:

(u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x

So applying that to (2b - a) × (3c + a), I can expand it as:

2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a

Wait, let me make sure I got the signs right. It's (2b - a) × (3c + a), so expanding it:

2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a

Yes, that seems right. Now, let's compute each term step by step.

First term: 2b × 3c. I can factor out the scalars, so that's 2*3*(b × c) = 6*(b × c). From the given, b × c is [1, -7, 18], so multiplying by 6 gives [6, -42, 108].

Second term: 2b × a. Hmm, cross product is anti-commutative, so b × a = - (a × b). Therefore, 2b × a = 2*(-a × b) = -2*(a × b). From the given, a × b is [6, -7, 3], so multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6].

Third term: -a × 3c. Again, scalars can be factored out, so that's -3*(a × c). From the given, a × c is [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6].

Fourth term: -a × a. Wait, the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, right? So -a × a = -0 = 0. So this term is just zero.

So now, putting it all together, I have:

First term: [6, -42, 108]
Second term: [-12, 14, -6]
Third term: [-12, -21, -6]
Fourth term: [0, 0, 0]

Now, I need to add these four vectors component-wise.

Let me write them down:

First component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) + 0 = 6 -12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18

Second component: -42 + 14 + (-21) + 0 = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49

Third component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) + 0 = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96

So adding them up, the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First component: 6 (from first term) minus 12 (second term) minus 12 (third term) is indeed -18.

Second component: -42 (first term) plus 14 (second term) minus 21 (third term) is -42 +14 = -28, then -28 -21 = -49. That's correct.

Third component: 108 (first term) minus 6 (second term) minus 6 (third term) is 108 -12 = 96. Yep, that's right.

So, putting it all together, the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, just to make sure I didn't mess up the signs anywhere. Let me go through each term again.

First term: 2b × 3c = 6*(b × c) = 6*[1, -7, 18] = [6, -42, 108]. Correct.

Second term: 2b × a = 2*(b × a) = 2*(-a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]. Correct.

Third term: -a × 3c = -3*(a × c) = -3*[4,7,2] = [-12, -21, -6]. Correct.

Fourth term: -a × a = 0. Correct.

Adding them up:

First components: 6 -12 -12 +0 = -18

Second components: -42 +14 -21 +0 = -49

Third components: 108 -6 -6 +0 = 96

Yes, that all checks out. So I think I did it right.

**Final Answer**
The result of $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

To compute the cross product \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

We know the following cross products:
1. \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\)
3. \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\)

Calculating each term:
1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\)

Adding these results component-wise:
- First component: \(6 - 12 - 12 + 0 = -18\)
- Second component: \(-42 + 14 - 21 + 0 = -49\)
- Third component: \(108 - 6 - 6 + 0 = 96\)

Thus, the result of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is:

\[

"Okay, so I need to figure out the average price Juan paid for his 70s stamps. Hmm, let me start by understanding the problem.

First, Juan organizes his stamps by country and by decade. The countries involved are Brazil, France, Peru, and Spain. Each of these countries has different prices per stamp: Brazil and France are 6 cents each, Peru is 4 cents each, and Spain is 5 cents each. The table provided shows the number of stamps he has from each country for each decade, like the 50s, 60s, 70s, and 80s.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the table is structured with columns for each decade (50s, 60s, 70s, 80s) and rows for each country (Brazil, France, Peru, Spain). Each cell in the table represents the number of stamps from that country in that decade.

So, for the 70s, I need to find out how many stamps he has from each country and then calculate the total cost for each country in the 70s. After that, I can find the total number of stamps in the 70s and the total cost, and then divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to get the average price per stamp.

Let me parse the Asymptote code to get the exact numbers. The code labels each cell with the number of stamps. For the 70s column, which is the third column (since 50s is first, 60s is second, 70s is third, 80s is fourth), the numbers are as follows:

- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

Wait, let me double-check. The Asymptote code labels each cell with the number of stamps. For the 70s, the cells are:

- 12 (Brazil)
- 12 (France)
- 6 (Peru)
- 13 (Spain)

Yes, that's correct. So, in the 70s, Juan has 12 stamps from Brazil, 12 from France, 6 from Peru, and 13 from Spain.

Now, each country's stamps have different prices:

- Brazil: $6$ cents each
- France: $6$ cents each
- Peru: $4$ cents each
- Spain: $5$ cents each

So, I need to calculate the total cost for each country in the 70s and then sum them up.

Let me compute each country's total cost:

1. Brazil: 12 stamps * 6 cents = 72 cents
2. France: 12 stamps * 6 cents = 72 cents
3. Peru: 6 stamps * 4 cents = 24 cents
4. Spain: 13 stamps * 5 cents = 65 cents

Now, adding these up to get the total cost for the 70s:

72 (Brazil) + 72 (France) + 24 (Peru) + 65 (Spain) = let's compute step by step.

72 + 72 = 144

144 + 24 = 168

168 + 65 = 233 cents

So, the total cost for all 70s stamps is 233 cents.

Next, I need the total number of stamps in the 70s. That's 12 + 12 + 6 + 13.

12 + 12 = 24

24 + 6 = 30

30 + 13 = 43 stamps

So, there are 43 stamps in total from the 70s.

Now, the average price per stamp is total cost divided by total number of stamps.

So, average price = 233 cents / 43 stamps

Let me compute that.

233 divided by 43. Hmm, 43 times 5 is 215, because 40*5=200 and 3*5=15, so 200+15=215.

233 - 215 = 18

So, 5 with a remainder of 18. So, 5 + 18/43.

18 divided by 43 is approximately 0.4186...

So, 5.4186... cents.

Rounded to the first decimal place, that's 5.4 cents.

Wait, let me verify the division again to make sure.

43 into 233:

43*5=215

233-215=18

So, 18/43 is approximately 0.4186, so total is 5.4186, which is approximately 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal.

Alternatively, if I use a calculator, 233 ÷ 43.

Let me compute 43*5=215, 43*5.4=43*(5 + 0.4)=215 + 17.2=232.2

Wait, 43*5.4=232.2, which is just 0.8 less than 233.

So, 5.4 + (0.8/43) ≈ 5.4 + 0.0186 ≈ 5.4186, which is still approximately 5.4186, so 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal.

Alternatively, if I compute 233 ÷ 43:

43 goes into 233 how many times?

43*5=215, as above.

233-215=18.

Bring down a zero: 180.

43 goes into 180 four times (43*4=172), remainder 8.

Bring down another zero: 80.

43 goes into 80 once (43*1=43), remainder 37.

Bring down another zero: 370.

43 goes into 370 eight times (43*8=344), remainder 26.

Bring down another zero: 260.

43 goes into 260 six times (43*6=258), remainder 2.

So, the decimal is 5.4186..., so 5.4186...

Rounded to the first decimal place, it's 5.4.

Wait, but sometimes when the second decimal is 5 or more, we round up. Here, the second decimal is 1, which is less than 5, so we keep it as 5.4.

Wait, no, wait. Wait, 5.4186 is 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal place because the second decimal is 1, which is less than 5, so we don't round up.

Wait, but actually, 5.4186 is approximately 5.42 when rounded to the second decimal, but since the question asks for the first decimal, it's 5.4.

Wait, but let me make sure. The number is 5.4186. The first decimal is 4, the second is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we don't round up the first decimal. So, it's 5.4.

Alternatively, if the number was 5.45, we would round up to 5.5, but here it's 5.4186, so 5.4.

Therefore, the average price per stamp in the 70s is approximately 5.4 cents.

Wait, but let me double-check all my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, the number of stamps in the 70s:

Brazil: 12

France: 12

Peru: 6

Spain: 13

Total: 12+12=24, 24+6=30, 30+13=43. That's correct.

Total cost:

Brazil: 12*6=72

France: 12*6=72

Peru: 6*4=24

Spain:13*5=65

Total cost: 72+72=144, 144+24=168, 168+65=233. Correct.

233 divided by 43: 5.4186... So, 5.4 when rounded to the first decimal.

Yes, that seems correct.

I think that's the answer.
</think>

The average price per 70s stamp is calculated by dividing the total cost of all 70s stamps by the total number of 70s stamps. 

Total cost = (12×6) + (12×6) + (6×4) + (13×5) = 72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 cents.

Total stamps = 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 stamps.

Average price = 233 / 43 ≈ 5.4186, which rounds to 5.4 cents.

"Okay, so I have this problem about a trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. They also tell me that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me draw a rough sketch. Since AD is parallel to BC, ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC. Let me label the vertices in order: A at the bottom left, B at the bottom right, C at the top right, and D at the top left. So, sides AB and CD are the non-parallel sides.

Now, AC is one of the diagonals, and it's perpendicular to CD. That means when AC meets CD at point C, they form a right angle. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC is equal to angle CAD.

Given that, maybe I can use some properties of trapezoids and angle bisectors. Let me recall that in a trapezoid, the area is given by the formula: (1/2)*(sum of the two bases)*height. Here, the area is 42, so (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height = 42. But I don't know the lengths of AD, BC, or the height yet.

Since AC is an angle bisector, maybe I can apply the Angle Bisector Theorem. In triangle ABD, if AC bisects angle BAD, then the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments created on side BD. Wait, but BD isn't necessarily a side here. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle. So, the area of triangle ACD would be (1/2)*AC*CD. If I can find AC and CD, I can compute this area.

But I don't know AC or CD. Maybe I can express them in terms of other sides or angles. Let me denote some variables. Let me let angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, angle ACD is 90 degrees. So, in triangle ACD, angle at C is 90, angle at A is θ, so angle at D must be 90 - θ.

Wait, but in trapezoid ABCD, AD is parallel to BC, so angle BAD and angle ABC are supplementary. Hmm, not sure if that helps directly.

Let me think about the properties of the trapezoid. Since AD || BC, the height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between AD and BC. Let me denote this height as h. So, the area is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*h = 42.

Now, since AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC is a diagonal, maybe I can find some relations using right triangles. Let me consider triangle ACD. It's a right triangle with legs AC and CD, and hypotenuse AD. So, AD = sqrt(AC² + CD²).

Also, since AC bisects angle BAD, which is angle at A. So, angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. Let me denote AB as one of the sides. Maybe I can express AB in terms of AC and some trigonometric functions.

Wait, in triangle ABC, if AC is the angle bisector, then by the Angle Bisector Theorem, the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of BC to CD. Wait, no, the Angle Bisector Theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it should divide side BD into segments proportional to AB and AD.

But BD is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe I need to consider triangle ABD. In triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. So, (AB)/(AD) = (BC)/(CD). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, the Angle Bisector Theorem says that if a bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. So, in triangle ABD, if AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, then it divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. So, (AB)/(AD) = (BC)/(CD). Wait, but BD is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up the sides.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points. Let me place point A at (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AC is perpendicular to CD, maybe I can set up coordinates such that calculations are easier.

Let me assume that AD is horizontal for simplicity. So, point A is at (0,0), and point D is at (d,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, point B must be somewhere along the y-axis, say at (0, h), and point C would be at (c, h). Wait, but then AC is the diagonal from (0,0) to (c, h), and CD is from (c, h) to (d,0). Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes should be -1.

Let me compute the slopes. The slope of AC is (h - 0)/(c - 0) = h/c. The slope of CD is (0 - h)/(d - c) = (-h)/(d - c). Since they are perpendicular, (h/c)*(-h/(d - c)) = -1. So, (h²)/(c(d - c)) = 1. Therefore, h² = c(d - c).

Also, since AC bisects angle BAD, which is the angle at A between AB and AD. Since AB is from (0,0) to (0, h), which is vertical, and AD is from (0,0) to (d,0), which is horizontal. So, angle BAD is 90 degrees, and AC bisects it, so angle BAC is 45 degrees. Wait, is that right?

Wait, if angle BAD is 90 degrees, and AC bisects it, then each angle is 45 degrees. So, angle BAC = angle CAD = 45 degrees. Therefore, triangle ABC is a 45-45-90 triangle? Wait, no, triangle ABC is not necessarily a right triangle. Wait, but AC is the angle bisector, making angle BAC 45 degrees.

Wait, in coordinate terms, if AC makes a 45-degree angle with AB, which is vertical, then the slope of AC should be tan(45) = 1. But the slope of AC is h/c, so h/c = 1, which means h = c. So, h = c.

But earlier, we had h² = c(d - c). Since h = c, substituting, we get c² = c(d - c). Dividing both sides by c (assuming c ≠ 0), we get c = d - c, so 2c = d, so d = 2c.

So, d = 2c, and h = c. So, point D is at (2c, 0), point C is at (c, c), and point B is at (0, c). Wait, point B is at (0, h) which is (0, c). So, coordinates are: A(0,0), B(0,c), C(c,c), D(2c,0).

Now, let's compute the area of the trapezoid ABCD. The formula is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height. AD is the length from A(0,0) to D(2c,0), which is 2c. BC is the length from B(0,c) to C(c,c), which is c. The height is the vertical distance between the two bases, which is c (since AD is at y=0 and BC is at y=c). So, area = (1/2)*(2c + c)*c = (1/2)*(3c)*c = (3/2)c².

Given that the area is 42, so (3/2)c² = 42. Solving for c²: c² = (42*2)/3 = 28. So, c² = 28, so c = sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7).

Now, I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Points A(0,0), C(c,c), D(2c,0). The area can be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates: (1/2)| (x_A(y_C - y_D) + x_C(y_D - y_A) + x_D(y_A - y_C) ) |.

Plugging in the coordinates: (1/2)| 0*(c - 0) + c*(0 - 0) + 2c*(0 - c) | = (1/2)| 0 + 0 - 2c² | = (1/2)*| -2c² | = (1/2)*(2c²) = c².

Since c² = 28, the area of triangle ACD is 28.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me verify another way. Since triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC and CD. AC has length sqrt(c² + c²) = c*sqrt(2). CD has length sqrt( (2c - c)² + (0 - c)² ) = sqrt(c² + c²) = c*sqrt(2). So, both legs are c*sqrt(2), so area is (1/2)*(c*sqrt(2))*(c*sqrt(2)) = (1/2)*(2c²) = c² = 28. Yep, same result.

So, the area of triangle ACD is 28.

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: √(2x) divided by √(3x - 1) equals 3/2. Hmm, let me write that down to visualize it better. It's √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2. Alright, I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.

First, I remember that when dealing with square roots in equations, it's often helpful to eliminate the radicals by squaring both sides. That should simplify things a bit. So, if I square both sides of the equation, I can get rid of the square roots. Let me try that.

Squaring the left side: (√(2x)/√(3x - 1))². That should be equal to (2x)/(3x - 1). And squaring the right side: (3/2)² is 9/4. So now, my equation becomes (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.

Alright, now I have a proportion here. I can cross-multiply to solve for x. So, cross-multiplying gives me 2x * 4 = 9 * (3x - 1). Let me compute both sides.

Left side: 2x * 4 is 8x. Right side: 9*(3x - 1) is 27x - 9. So now, the equation is 8x = 27x - 9.

Hmm, okay, let's get all the x terms on one side. I'll subtract 8x from both sides to get 0 = 19x - 9. Wait, that's 27x - 8x is 19x, so 0 = 19x - 9. Then, adding 9 to both sides gives 9 = 19x. So, x is 9/19.

Wait, but before I conclude, I should check if this solution is valid in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. So, let me plug x = 9/19 back into the original equation and see if it holds true.

First, compute √(2x). 2x is 2*(9/19) which is 18/19. So, √(18/19). Then, compute √(3x - 1). 3x is 27/19, so 27/19 - 1 is 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19. So, √(8/19).

Now, the left side of the equation is √(18/19)/√(8/19). Let's simplify that. The denominators are the same, so it's √18 / √8. Which is √(18/8). Simplify 18/8 to 9/4, so √(9/4) is 3/2. Which is exactly the right side of the equation. So, yes, it checks out.

Therefore, x = 9/19 is the correct solution.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes. Let me go through the steps again.

Starting with √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2.

Square both sides: (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.

Cross-multiplying: 8x = 27x - 9.

Subtract 8x: 0 = 19x - 9.

Add 9: 9 = 19x.

So, x = 9/19. Yep, that seems consistent.

And when I checked by plugging back in, it worked out. So, I think that's solid.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps seem straightforward, and the check confirms the solution. So, I'm confident that x is 9/19.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( x \) is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{19}}.
</think>

To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
\left( \frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x - 1}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):

\[
2x \cdot 4 = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Subtracting \(8x\) from both sides:

\[
0 = 19x - 9
\]

Adding 9 to both sides:

\[
9 = 19x
\]

Thus, solving for \(x\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

We verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation and confirming it holds true. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where four points A, B, C, D are randomly and independently chosen on a circle. I need to find the probability that the line segments AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I should visualize the problem. Imagine a circle with four points on its circumference. These points are placed randomly, so their positions are independent of each other. The question is about the probability that when I connect A to B and C to D, these two chords intersect each other inside the circle.

I remember that for two chords to intersect inside a circle, the four points must be arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, if I go around the circle, I should encounter the points in the order A, C, B, D or some rotation of that order. If they are in order like A, B, C, D, then the chords AB and CD won't intersect because they are on opposite sides of the circle.

So, the key here is the arrangement of the four points. Since the points are chosen randomly, all possible orderings are equally likely. I think the number of ways the four points can be arranged around the circle is related to permutations, but since the circle doesn't have a fixed starting point, it's a bit different.

Wait, actually, when dealing with points on a circle, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! for n points because rotations are considered the same. But in this case, since we're dealing with four points, the number of distinct orderings is (4-1)! = 6. But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I should fix one point and arrange the others relative to it. Let's fix point A at a certain position on the circle. Then, the positions of B, C, and D are determined relative to A. Since the circle is continuous, the exact positions don't matter, only their order around the circumference.

So, fixing A, the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 different orders around the circle. Each of these orders is equally likely because the points are chosen independently and uniformly.

Now, out of these 6 possible arrangements, how many result in the chords AB and CD intersecting? Let's list them:

1. A, B, C, D
2. A, B, D, C
3. A, C, B, D
4. A, C, D, B
5. A, D, B, C
6. A, D, C, B

Wait, actually, since we fixed A, the order is determined by the positions of B, C, D. So, the possible orderings are the permutations of B, C, D. Let me think of them as sequences starting from A and going clockwise.

So, the possible orderings are:

1. A, B, C, D
2. A, B, D, C
3. A, C, B, D
4. A, C, D, B
5. A, D, B, C
6. A, D, C, B

Now, for each of these, I need to check if AB and CD intersect.

Let's analyze each case:

1. A, B, C, D: Here, AB is from A to B, and CD is from C to D. Since B and C are adjacent, and D is after C, the chords AB and CD don't intersect because they are on opposite sides of the circle.

2. A, B, D, C: AB is from A to B, CD is from D to C. Since D is between B and C, CD is a chord that goes from D to C, which is adjacent to B. So, AB is from A to B, and CD is from D to C. Do they intersect? Let me draw this mentally. A is fixed, then B, then D, then C. So, AB is a chord from A to B, and CD is from C to D. Since C is next to D, CD is a small chord near D and C. AB is a chord from A to B, which is on the other side. So, they don't intersect.

Wait, maybe I should think in terms of the order. If the points are A, B, D, C, then the chords AB and CD would not cross because AB is between A and B, and CD is between C and D, which are on the opposite side.

3. A, C, B, D: Here, AB is from A to B, and CD is from C to D. Let's see the order: A, then C, then B, then D. So, AB is from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, does AB cross CD? Let me imagine: A is first, then C, then B, then D. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, these two chords would cross each other because AB goes from A to B, passing through the area where CD is from C to D. So, yes, they intersect.

4. A, C, D, B: AB is from A to B, CD is from C to D. The order is A, C, D, B. So, AB is from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is between C and D. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after D, and CD is from C to D. So, do they intersect? Let me visualize: A, then C, then D, then B. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is between C and D. So, these chords would intersect because AB passes through the area where CD is. So, yes, they intersect.

5. A, D, B, C: AB is from A to B, CD is from C to D. The order is A, D, B, C. So, AB is from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, AB is a chord from A to B, which is after D, and CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, do they intersect? Let me think: A, D, B, C. So, AB is from A to B, which is after D. CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, which is after D, and CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, these chords would intersect because AB is crossing over the area where CD is. So, yes, they intersect.

6. A, D, C, B: AB is from A to B, CD is from C to D. The order is A, D, C, B. So, AB is from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is after A. Wait, no, CD is from C to D, which is after A? Wait, no, the order is A, D, C, B. So, CD is from C to D, but D is before C in this order? Wait, no, in the order A, D, C, B, moving clockwise, D comes after A, then C comes after D, then B comes after C. So, CD is from C to D, but D is before C in the clockwise order. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, in the order A, D, C, B, moving clockwise, the points are A, then D, then C, then B. So, CD is from C to D, but D is before C in this order. So, CD would actually be a chord that goes from C back to D, which is counterclockwise. But in terms of intersection, does that matter? Hmm, maybe not, because chords are just straight lines regardless of direction.

Wait, perhaps I should think in terms of the arcs. If the points are in the order A, D, C, B, then AB is from A to B, which is a long chord going from A to B, passing through the area where D and C are. CD is from C to D, which is a chord between C and D, which are adjacent in this order. So, do AB and CD intersect? Let me visualize: A is first, then D, then C, then B. So, AB is a chord from A to B, which is after C. CD is from C to D, which is between D and C. So, AB is a chord that goes from A to B, passing through the area where CD is. So, yes, they intersect.

Wait, but in this case, CD is from C to D, which are adjacent, so CD is a small chord near D and C. AB is a chord from A to B, which is after C. So, AB would pass over the area where CD is, so they intersect.

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two circles with the same center D. One has a radius of 1, and the other has a radius of 2. So, the bigger circle is twice as big as the smaller one. The problem mentions a shaded area, and it says that the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of angle ADC, which is the angle at point D between points A and C. Hmm, I think points A and C must be points where the shaded area is defined, maybe where the two circles intersect or something like that.

Wait, actually, the problem says ""작은"" which is Korean for ""small."" So, it's asking for the measure of the small angle ADC. So, angle ADC is the smaller angle between the two points A and C on the circles.

Let me try to sketch this in my mind. There's a center D, with two concentric circles. The smaller one has radius 1, the larger one radius 2. The shaded area is some region, and its total area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, the area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. Therefore, the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

Now, I need to figure out what this shaded area is. Since there are two circles, maybe the shaded area is a segment or a sector of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle? Or perhaps it's a lens-shaped area where the two circles overlap? Wait, but since they have the same center, they don't overlap in a lens shape; they are concentric. So, the area between them would be an annulus. But the problem mentions a shaded area, which is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. So, maybe it's a sector of the annulus?

Wait, if the circles are concentric, then any sector of the larger circle minus the corresponding sector of the smaller circle would form a sort of ring segment. So, the area of such a segment would be (1/2)*R²θ - (1/2)*r²θ, where θ is the central angle in radians. So, the area would be (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ.

Given that, the shaded area is (1/2)*(2² - 1²)*θ = (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)*θ. And this area is equal to (5/3)π. So, setting up the equation:

(3/2)*θ = (5/3)π

Solving for θ:

θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π radians.

But wait, the problem asks for the measure of angle ADC in degrees. So, I need to convert radians to degrees. Since π radians is 180 degrees, θ in degrees is (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.

But wait, the problem mentions ""작은"" which is the small angle. So, if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would actually be 160 degrees because the total around a point is 360 degrees. Wait, no, 200 degrees is the angle, but since it's a central angle, the smaller angle would be the minimum between θ and 360 - θ. So, if θ is 200 degrees, the smaller angle is 160 degrees. But wait, 200 degrees is more than 180, so the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations. The area of the shaded region is (3/2)*θ = (5/3)π. So, θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = 10π/9 radians. Converting that to degrees: 10π/9 * (180/π) = 200 degrees. So, the central angle is 200 degrees, but since we're asked for the smaller angle, it's 360 - 200 = 160 degrees.

Wait, but is the shaded area a sector of the annulus? Or is it something else? Let me think again. If the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle, then yes, the area would be (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ. So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle. But in that case, the area would be (1/2)*R²*(θ - sinθ) - (1/2)*r²*(θ - sinθ). But that seems more complicated, and the problem doesn't mention anything about segments, just the total shaded area. So, I think it's more likely that it's a sector area.

Wait, but let me confirm. If the shaded area is a sector of the annulus, then the area is (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ. So, plugging in R=2, r=1, we get (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)*θ. And this equals (5/12)*Area of larger circle, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So, (3/2)*θ = (5/3)π, so θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = 10π/9 radians, which is 200 degrees. So, the central angle is 200 degrees, but since it's asking for the smaller angle, it's 160 degrees.

Wait, but 200 degrees is the angle, and the smaller angle would be 160 degrees because 360 - 200 = 160. So, the measure of the small angle ADC is 160 degrees.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the area calculation. The area of the annulus sector is indeed (1/2)*(R² - r²)*θ. So, with R=2, r=1, it's (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)*θ. Setting that equal to (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So, (3/2)*θ = (5/3)π. Solving for θ: θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = 10π/9 radians. Converting to degrees: 10π/9 * (180/π) = 200 degrees. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the measure of the small angle ADC is 160 degrees.

"Okay, so I have this expression to compute: \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. I remember that there are product-to-sum formulas, but I'm not sure if they apply directly here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the sine addition and subtraction formulas. Let me think.

The expression is a product of two sine functions, each involving arcsin terms. Let me denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). So, the expression becomes \(\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\beta - \alpha)\). That seems a bit simpler.

Now, I remember that there's a product identity for sine functions: \(\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]\). Maybe I can apply that here. Let me set \(A = \alpha + \beta\) and \(B = \beta - \alpha\). Then, the product becomes:

\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))]
\]

Simplifying the arguments inside the cosines:

First term: \((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha) = \alpha + \beta - \beta + \alpha = 2\alpha\)

Second term: \((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha) = \alpha + \beta + \beta - \alpha = 2\beta\)

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos(2\alpha) - \cos(2\beta)]
\]

Alright, so now I need to compute \(\cos(2\alpha)\) and \(\cos(2\beta)\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), I can use the double-angle identity for cosine: \(\cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\).

Let's compute \(\cos(2\alpha)\):

\[
\cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Similarly, compute \(\cos(2\beta)\):

\[
\cos(2\beta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

So, plugging these back into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} (0.18) = 0.09
\]

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I set \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, I used the product identity correctly, which transformed the product into a difference of cosines. Then, I applied the double-angle formula correctly for both \(\cos(2\alpha)\) and \(\cos(2\beta)\). The calculations for each cosine term seem right: 0.4 squared is 0.16, times 2 is 0.32, subtracted from 1 gives 0.68. For 0.5, squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5, subtracted from 1 gives 0.5. Then, subtracting 0.5 from 0.68 gives 0.18, and half of that is 0.09.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem without using the product identity. Let me try another method to verify.

Another approach: Let me compute \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin(\beta - \alpha)\) separately and then multiply them.

First, compute \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\). Using the sine addition formula:

\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Similarly, compute \(\sin(\beta - \alpha)\) using the sine subtraction formula:

\[
\sin(\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

So, the product becomes:

\[
[\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta] \cdot [\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha]
\]

Let me expand this product:

First, multiply \(\sin \alpha \cos \beta\) with each term in the second bracket:

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \beta \cdot \sin \beta \cos \alpha = \sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta
\]
\[
\sin \alpha \cos \beta \cdot (-\cos \beta \sin \alpha) = -\sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta
\]

Next, multiply \(\cos \alpha \sin \beta\) with each term in the second bracket:

\[
\cos \alpha \sin \beta \cdot \sin \beta \cos \alpha = \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta
\]
\[
\cos \alpha \sin \beta \cdot (-\cos \beta \sin \alpha) = -\cos \alpha \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \beta
\]

So, combining all these terms:

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \beta
\]

Notice that the first and last terms cancel each other out:

\[
\sin \alpha \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha \cos \beta \sin \beta = 0
\]

So, we're left with:

\[
- \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta
\]

Factor this expression:

\[
\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta
\]

This can be written as:

\[
(\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 - (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2
\]

Which is a difference of squares, so it factors as:

\[
(\cos \alpha \sin \beta - \sin \alpha \cos \beta)(\cos \alpha \sin \beta + \sin \alpha \cos \beta)
\]

Wait, but that seems like going in circles because the original product was \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\sin(\beta - \alpha)\), which is similar to this. Maybe I should compute the numerical values instead.

Given that \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), let's compute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\), \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). Then, we can find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\) using the Pythagorean identity: \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}\).

Compute \(\cos \alpha\):

\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} \approx 0.9165
\]

Compute \(\cos \beta\):

\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.8660
\]

Now, plug these into the expression \(\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta\):

First, compute \(\cos^2 \alpha\):

\[
(0.9165)^2 \approx 0.84
\]

Compute \(\sin^2 \beta\):

\[
(0.5)^2 = 0.25
\]

So, \(\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta \approx 0.84 \times 0.25 = 0.21\)

Next, compute \(\sin^2 \alpha\):

\[
(0.4)^2 = 0.16
\]

Compute \(\cos^2 \beta\):

\[
(0.8660)^2 \approx 0.75
\]

So, \(\sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta \approx 0.16 \times 0.75 = 0.12\)

Subtracting these:

\[
0.21 - 0.12 = 0.09
\]

So, the product is 0.09, which matches the result I got earlier using the product identity. That's reassuring.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of this expression as \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B)\), which is a known identity. Wait, actually, the identity is \(\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B\). Let me verify that.

Yes, indeed, using the identity:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

So, in this case, if I let \(A = \beta\) and \(B = \alpha\), then:

\[
\sin(\beta + \alpha)\sin(\beta - \alpha) = \sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha
\]

Which is exactly the expression I had earlier: \(\sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha\). So, plugging in the values:

\[
\sin^2 0.5 - \sin^2 0.4 = (0.5)^2 - (0.4)^2 = 0.25 - 0.16 = 0.09
\]

Wow, that was much simpler! I should have thought of that identity earlier. It directly gives the result without going through the product expansion.

So, regardless of the method, the result is 0.09. Therefore, the value of the original expression is 0.09.

Just to make sure, let me compute it numerically using approximate values.

Compute \(\arcsin 0.4\): Let's find the angle whose sine is 0.4. Using a calculator, \(\arcsin 0.4 \approx 0.4115\) radians.

Compute \(\arcsin 0.5\): That's a standard angle, \(\pi/6\) or approximately 0.5236 radians.

Now, compute \(\alpha + \beta \approx 0.4115 + 0.5236 = 0.9351\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(0.9351)\): Using a calculator, \(\sin(0.9351) \approx 0.8078\).

Next, compute \(\beta - \alpha \approx 0.5236 - 0.4115 = 0.1121\) radians.

Compute \(\sin(0.1121)\): Using a calculator, \(\sin(0.1121) \approx 0.1119\).

Now, multiply these two results: \(0.8078 \times 0.1119 \approx 0.0903\), which is approximately 0.09. So, that confirms the result numerically.

Therefore, I'm confident that the value of the expression is 0.09.

**Final Answer**
The value of the expression is \boxed{0.09}.
</think>

Let \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). The given expression is \(\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the identity for the product of sines, we have:
\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2\alpha) - \cos(2\beta)]

We compute \(\cos(2\alpha)\) and \(\cos(2\beta)\) using the double-angle identity \(\cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\):

\[
\cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 0.68

\[
\cos(2\beta) = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 0.5

Substituting these values back into the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} (0.18) = 0.09

"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a committee with 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats. I need to figure out how many ways there are to form a subcommittee of 5 people, but with the condition that each party must have at least one member in the subcommittee. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with combinations, the total number of ways to choose a group without any restrictions is calculated using the combination formula. The combination formula is C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n - k)!), where n is the total number of items, and k is the number of items to choose.

So, in this case, the total number of people is 8 Republicans + 6 Democrats = 14 people. If there were no restrictions, the number of ways to choose 5 people would be C(14, 5). Let me calculate that:

C(14, 5) = 14! / (5! * (14 - 5)!) = (14 * 13 * 12 * 11 * 10) / (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 2002.

But wait, that's without any restrictions. The problem says that each party must have at least one member. So, I can't have a subcommittee that's all Republicans or all Democrats. Therefore, I need to subtract the cases where all 5 are Republicans or all 5 are Democrats.

Let me calculate those two cases separately.

First, the number of ways to choose all Republicans: there are 8 Republicans, so choosing 5 from them is C(8, 5). Let me compute that:

C(8, 5) = 8! / (5! * (8 - 5)!) = (8 * 7 * 6) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 56.

Next, the number of ways to choose all Democrats: there are 6 Democrats, so choosing 5 from them is C(6, 5). Calculating that:

C(6, 5) = 6! / (5! * (6 - 5)!) = 6 / 1 = 6.

So, the total number of invalid subcommittees (all Republicans or all Democrats) is 56 + 6 = 62.

Therefore, the number of valid subcommittees is the total number without restrictions minus the invalid ones:

2002 - 62 = 1940.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Total number of ways: C(14,5) is indeed 2002. All Republicans: C(8,5) is 56, and all Democrats: C(6,5) is 6. So, 56 + 6 is 62. Subtracting that from 2002 gives 1940. That seems right.

Alternatively, I could think about it by considering the different possible distributions of Republicans and Democrats in the subcommittee. Since each party must have at least one member, the possible splits are:

- 1 Republican and 4 Democrats
- 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats
- 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats
- 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat

I can calculate each of these and sum them up.

Let's compute each case:

1. 1R and 4D: C(8,1) * C(6,4)
   - C(8,1) = 8
   - C(6,4) = 15
   - So, 8 * 15 = 120

2. 2R and 3D: C(8,2) * C(6,3)
   - C(8,2) = 28
   - C(6,3) = 20
   - So, 28 * 20 = 560

3. 3R and 2D: C(8,3) * C(6,2)
   - C(8,3) = 56
   - C(6,2) = 15
   - So, 56 * 15 = 840

4. 4R and 1D: C(8,4) * C(6,1)
   - C(8,4) = 70
   - C(6,1) = 6
   - So, 70 * 6 = 420

Now, adding all these up: 120 + 560 + 840 + 420.

Let me compute that step by step:

120 + 560 = 680

680 + 840 = 1520

1520 + 420 = 1940

So, that's the same result as before. That gives me more confidence that 1940 is the correct answer.

I think both methods confirm that the number of ways is 1940. So, I can be pretty sure that's the right answer.

**Final Answer**
The number of ways is \boxed{1940}.
</think>

To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each party, we start by calculating the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \( C(14, 5) \):

\[
C(14, 5) = \frac{14!}{5!(14 - 5)!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we subtract the cases where all members are from one party. We calculate the number of ways to choose all Republicans and all Democrats:

- All Republicans: \( C(8, 5) \)
  \[
  C(8, 5) = \frac{8!}{5!(8 - 5)!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
  \]

- All Democrats: \( C(6, 5) \)
  \[
  C(6, 5) = \frac{6!}{5!(6 - 5)!} = 6
  \]

Adding these invalid cases together:
\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Subtracting the invalid cases from the total:
\[
2002 - 62 = 1940
\]

We can also verify this by considering the different valid distributions of Republicans and Democrats:

- 1 Republican and 4 Democrats: \( C(8, 1) \times C(6, 4) = 8 \times 15 = 120 \)
- 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats: \( C(8, 2) \times C(6, 3) = 28 \times 20 = 560 \)
- 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats: \( C(8, 3) \times C(6, 2) = 56 \times 15 = 840 \)
- 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat: \( C(8, 4) \times C(6, 1) = 70 \times 6 = 420 \)

Adding these valid cases together:
\[
120 + 560 + 840 + 420 = 1940

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. Alright, I need to find the positive value of x that satisfies this equation.

First, I remember that to get rid of a cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation. That should help me simplify things. So, if I cube both sides, the left side becomes just x² - 4x + 4, and the right side becomes 16 cubed. Let me calculate 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and then 256 times 16... let me do that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 is 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.

Now, my equation is x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Hmm, okay, so I can rewrite this as a quadratic equation. Let me subtract 4096 from both sides to set it to zero. That gives me x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation becomes x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.

Alright, now I have a quadratic equation: x² - 4x - 4092 = 0. I need to solve for x. I can use the quadratic formula here, which is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values into the formula.

First, let's calculate the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. So, b squared is (-4)², which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 times 1 times (-4092), which is 4 * (-4092) = -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 16 + 16368 is 16384. That's a perfect square, right? Because 128 squared is 16384. Let me check: 128 times 128. 100 times 128 is 12800, 28 times 128 is 3584, so 12800 + 3584 is 16384. Yep, that's correct.

So, the square root of the discriminant is 128. Now, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [-(-4) ± 128] / (2*1). Simplifying that, -(-4) is 4, so x = [4 ± 128] / 2. That gives me two possible solutions.

First solution: (4 + 128)/2 = 132/2 = 66. Second solution: (4 - 128)/2 = (-124)/2 = -62. But wait, the problem specifies that x is a positive number, so I can discard the negative solution. Therefore, x must be 66.

Let me double-check my work to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the original equation: ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. If x is 66, then x² is 66 squared, which is 4356. Then, 4x is 4*66 = 264. So, x² - 4x + 4 is 4356 - 264 + 4. Let's compute that: 4356 - 264 is 4092, and 4092 + 4 is 4096. The cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, since 16 cubed is 4096. So, that checks out.

I think I did everything correctly. I cubed both sides, solved the quadratic, checked the discriminant, found the roots, and verified the positive solution. So, yeah, x is 66.

**Final Answer**
The positive value of \( x \) is \boxed{66}.
</think>

To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\) for a positive \(x\), we start by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we rewrite this as a quadratic equation by subtracting 4096 from both sides:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]

Simplifying further, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). First, we calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384
\]

The square root of the discriminant is:

\[
\sqrt{16384} = 128
\]

Substituting back into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm 128}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
\]

Since we are looking for a positive value, we discard \(-62\). Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) is:

\[
\boxed{66}

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify it.

First, I notice that the angles inside the cosines are doubling each time: 2π/15, then 4π/15, then 8π/15, and then 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is more than π, so maybe I can use the identity that relates cos(θ) to cos(θ - 2π) or something like that. Let me check: cos(16π/15) is the same as cos(16π/15 - 2π) which is cos(-14π/15). But cosine is even, so that's equal to cos(14π/15). Hmm, 14π/15 is still more than π/2, but maybe that's useful later.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for multiple angles or product-to-sum formulas. I remember that the product of cosines can sometimes be expressed as a sum, but with four terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, perhaps there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines with angles in geometric progression.

Wait, I think there's a formula for the product of cosines where each angle is double the previous one. Let me recall. I think it's something like cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * ... * cos(2^{n}θ) = something involving sine functions. Let me try to remember or derive it.

I recall that sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so maybe I can use that recursively. Let's see:

If I have sin(θ) * 2 cosθ = sin(2θ)
Then sin(2θ) * 2 cos(2θ) = sin(4θ)
Similarly, sin(4θ) * 2 cos(4θ) = sin(8θ)
And so on.

So, if I multiply all these together, I get:

sin(θ) * 2 cosθ * 2 cos(2θ) * 2 cos(4θ) * ... * 2 cos(2^{n}θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)

So, rearranging, the product of the cosines is sin(2^{n+1}θ) / (2^{n} sinθ)

In this case, I have four cosines: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), cos(16π/15). Let me see if this fits the pattern.

Let me set θ = 2π/15. Then the angles are θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ. So n=3 because we have four terms (from θ to 8θ, which is 2^3 θ). So according to the formula, the product would be sin(16θ) / (2^3 sinθ). Let's compute that.

First, θ = 2π/15, so 16θ = 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15. But 32π/15 is more than 2π, so let's subtract 2π to find the equivalent angle: 32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15).

So the product becomes sin(2π/15) / (8 sin(2π/15)) = 1/8.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check.

So, using the formula:

Product = [cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * cos8θ] = sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ)

With θ = 2π/15, 16θ = 32π/15, which is equivalent to 32π/15 - 2π = 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15)) = 1/8.

But wait, the original product is cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). I used θ=2π/15, so the last term is cos(16θ) = cos(32π/15) = cos(2π/15) because cos is periodic with period 2π. But wait, cos(32π/15) is actually cos(32π/15 - 2π) = cos(2π/15). So yes, that's correct.

But wait, in the formula, the product is up to cos(8θ), which is cos(16π/15). So yes, that's correct. So the product is indeed 1/8.

Wait, but let me check if I applied the formula correctly. The formula says that the product from k=0 to n of cos(2^k θ) is sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ). Wait, no, in my earlier thought, I think I might have miscounted the number of terms. Let me check again.

Wait, the formula is for the product of cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * ... * cos(2^{n}θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ). So in this case, we have four terms: θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ, which is n=3 because 2^3=8. So the product is sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So yes, that's correct.

So with θ=2π/15, 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.

Wait, but let me compute the product numerically to check. Let me compute each cosine term:

cos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135
cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691
cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045
cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781

Multiplying them together: 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118; 0.6118 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639; -0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625. Hmm, 0.0625 is 1/16, not 1/8. Wait, that's a problem. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, that's conflicting with my earlier conclusion. So either my formula is wrong or my calculation is wrong. Let me check the numerical values again.

Wait, cos(8π/15) is cos(96°), which is indeed negative because 96° is in the second quadrant where cosine is negative. Similarly, cos(16π/15) is cos(192°), which is also negative because 192° is in the third quadrant where cosine is negative. So multiplying two negative terms gives positive, so the overall product should be positive. But according to my calculation, it's approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16.

But according to the formula, it should be 1/8. So there's a discrepancy here. That means I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula is:

Product_{k=0}^{n} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ)

Wait, in my case, I have four terms: cosθ, cos2θ, cos4θ, cos8θ, which is k=0 to 3, so n=3. Therefore, the product should be sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So with θ=2π/15, 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.

But numerically, I got approximately 1/16. So where is the mistake?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me recalculate the product more accurately.

Compute each cosine:

cos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135454576
cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691306064
cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045284633
cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781476007

Now multiply them step by step:

First, 0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 ≈ 0.6118034009

Next, 0.6118034009 * (-0.1045284633) ≈ -0.0639000000

Then, -0.0639000000 * (-0.9781476007) ≈ 0.0625

So the product is approximately 0.0625, which is 1/16.

But according to the formula, it should be 1/8. So there's a conflict. Therefore, I must have made a mistake in applying the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the product up to cos(2^n θ), but in my case, the last term is cos(16π/15), which is cos(8θ) where θ=2π/15. So n=3, so the product should be sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). But 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.

But numerically, I get 1/16. So perhaps the formula is different. Maybe I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula is:

Product_{k=0}^{n} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ)

So for n=3, it's sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So that's correct.

But in my case, the product is cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * cos8θ, which is exactly the product from k=0 to 3 of cos(2^k θ). So according to the formula, it should be sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). So with θ=2π/15, 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(8 sin(2π/15))=1/8.

But numerically, I get 1/16. So perhaps I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me check the values again.

Wait, cos(8π/15) is cos(96°), which is approximately -0.1045284633. Cos(16π/15)=cos(192°)=cos(180°+12°)= -cos(12°)≈-0.9781476007.

So the product is:

cos(24°)*cos(48°)*cos(96°)*cos(192°) ≈ 0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 * (-0.1045284633) * (-0.9781476007)

Let me compute step by step:

First, 0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 ≈ 0.6118034009

Then, 0.6118034009 * (-0.1045284633) ≈ -0.0639000000

Then, -0.0639000000 * (-0.9781476007) ≈ 0.0625

So 0.0625 is 1/16, not 1/8. So there's a discrepancy. Therefore, my formula must be incorrect or I'm applying it wrong.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the product up to cos(2^n θ), but in my case, the last term is cos(8θ)=cos(16π/15). So n=3, so the product is sin(16θ)/(8 sinθ). But 16θ=32π/15=2π/15 + 2π","[2, '2']",\frac{1}{16},"[1/16, '\\frac{1}{16}']",False
"Alright, so I have this problem about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, and the height AM is 11 units. There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

First, let me visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base is BC, and the height AM splits BC into two equal parts, BM and MC. So, M is the midpoint of BC. The height AM is 11, so the coordinates might help here. Maybe I can place point A at (0,11), M at (0,0), and then B and C on the x-axis at (-x,0) and (x,0) respectively. That way, AM is the vertical line from (0,11) to (0,0), and BC is the base from (-x,0) to (x,0).

Point D is on AM, and AD is 10. Since AM is 11, D must be 10 units below A, so its coordinates would be (0,1). That makes sense because from A at (0,11), moving down 10 units along the y-axis gets us to (0,1).

Now, the key part is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.

Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are equal. Let's denote each of those angles as φ. So, in triangle ABC, the angles are θ at A, and φ at B and C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have θ + 2φ = 180°, so φ = (180° - θ)/2.

Now, looking at triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C form triangle BDC, and angle at D is 3θ. I need to find some relationship here. Maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.

But before that, let me note the coordinates of all points:

- A: (0,11)
- M: (0,0)
- B: (-x,0)
- C: (x,0)
- D: (0,1)

So, BD is the line from (-x,0) to (0,1), and CD is the line from (x,0) to (0,1). Let me compute the lengths of BD and CD.

Using the distance formula:

BD = sqrt[ (0 - (-x))² + (1 - 0)² ] = sqrt(x² + 1)
CD = sqrt[ (0 - x)² + (1 - 0)² ] = sqrt(x² + 1)

So, BD = CD. That means triangle BDC is also isosceles with BD = CD. Therefore, the base angles at B and C in triangle BDC are equal. Let me denote each of those angles as ψ. So, in triangle BDC, the angles are 3θ at D, and ψ at B and C. So, 3θ + 2ψ = 180°, which gives ψ = (180° - 3θ)/2.

But wait, in triangle ABC, the angles at B and C are φ, which is (180° - θ)/2. So, in triangle BDC, the angles at B and C are ψ, which is (180° - 3θ)/2. Hmm, is there a relationship between φ and ψ?

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the slopes of BD and CD, then compute the angles. But that might get complicated. Alternatively, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry to find the angles.

Alternatively, perhaps using trigonometric identities. Let me think about triangle ABD and triangle ACD.

Wait, since BD = CD, triangle BDC is isosceles, so the angles at B and C are equal, which I already noted. So, angle at B in triangle BDC is ψ, and angle at C is ψ. So, angle BDC is 3θ.

But in triangle ABC, angle at B is φ, which is (180° - θ)/2. So, in triangle BDC, angle at B is ψ, which is (180° - 3θ)/2.

But angle at B in triangle ABC is φ, and angle at B in triangle BDC is ψ. Are these related? Maybe, because point D is on AM, which is the altitude. So, perhaps the angles at B in ABC and BDC are related through some other triangle.

Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, sides BD = CD = sqrt(x² + 1), and BC = 2x. So, sides are BD = CD = sqrt(x² + 1), and BC = 2x.

Using the Law of Sines on triangle BDC:

BD / sin(angle at C) = BC / sin(angle at D)

So, sqrt(x² + 1) / sin(ψ) = 2x / sin(3θ)

But ψ = (180° - 3θ)/2, so sin(ψ) = sin( (180° - 3θ)/2 ) = sin(90° - 3θ/2) = cos(3θ/2)

So, sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3θ/2) = 2x / sin(3θ)

Cross-multiplying:

sqrt(x² + 1) * sin(3θ) = 2x * cos(3θ/2)

Hmm, that's one equation.

Now, let's look at triangle ABC. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, and height AM = 11, so AB = AC = sqrt(x² + 11²) = sqrt(x² + 121). The base BC is 2x.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ, so using the Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cosθ

But AB = AC, so:

(2x)² = 2*(sqrt(x² + 121))² - 2*(sqrt(x² + 121))² * cosθ

Simplify:

4x² = 2*(x² + 121) - 2*(x² + 121)*cosθ

Divide both sides by 2:

2x² = (x² + 121) - (x² + 121)*cosθ

Rearrange:

2x² - (x² + 121) = - (x² + 121)*cosθ

So,

x² - 121 = - (x² + 121)*cosθ

Multiply both sides by -1:

121 - x² = (x² + 121)*cosθ

So,

cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)

That's equation (1).

Now, going back to the equation from triangle BDC:

sqrt(x² + 1) * sin(3θ) = 2x * cos(3θ/2)

Let me express sin(3θ) in terms of sinθ and cosθ. Using the identity:

sin(3θ) = 3sinθ - 4sin³θ

But I also have cos(3θ/2). Maybe using the identity for cos(3θ/2) in terms of cosθ.

Alternatively, perhaps express everything in terms of cosθ, since I have cosθ from equation (1).

Let me denote cosθ = c, so c = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)

Then, sinθ = sqrt(1 - c²) = sqrt(1 - [(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]² )

But that might get messy. Alternatively, maybe using multiple-angle identities.

Alternatively, let me express sin(3θ) and cos(3θ/2) in terms of sinθ and cosθ.

First, sin(3θ) = 3sinθ - 4sin³θ

And cos(3θ/2) can be expressed using the half-angle formula:

cos(3θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + cos(3θ))/2 )

But cos(3θ) can be expressed as 4cos³θ - 3cosθ.

So, cos(3θ) = 4c³ - 3c

Therefore, cos(3θ/2) = sqrt( (1 + 4c³ - 3c)/2 )

Hmm, this is getting complicated, but let's proceed.

So, substituting back into the equation:

sqrt(x² + 1) * [3sinθ - 4sin³θ] = 2x * sqrt( (1 + 4c³ - 3c)/2 )

But c = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²), so let's compute 4c³ - 3c:

4c³ - 3c = 4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]

This is getting really complicated. Maybe there's a better approach.

Alternatively, perhaps using coordinate geometry to find the angles.

Since D is at (0,1), B is at (-x,0), and C is at (x,0). So, vectors BD and CD can be found.

Vector BD is from B to D: (0 - (-x), 1 - 0) = (x,1)
Vector CD is from C to D: (0 - x, 1 - 0) = (-x,1)

The angle at D, angle BDC, is the angle between vectors DB and DC. Wait, no, angle BDC is at D, so it's the angle between DB and DC.

Wait, actually, in terms of vectors, the angle at D is between vectors DB and DC. So, vectors from D to B and D to C.

Vector DB is B - D = (-x - 0, 0 - 1) = (-x, -1)
Vector DC is C - D = (x - 0, 0 - 1) = (x, -1)

So, the angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC, which is 3θ.

The cosine of the angle between two vectors u and v is (u · v)/(|u||v|)

So, cos(angle BDC) = [(-x)(x) + (-1)(-1)] / (|DB| |DC|)

Compute numerator: (-x)(x) + (-1)(-1) = -x² + 1

Denominator: |DB| = sqrt(x² + 1), |DC| = sqrt(x² + 1), so denominator is (sqrt(x² + 1))² = x² + 1

So,

cos(3θ) = (-x² + 1)/(x² + 1)

But from earlier, we have cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)

So, we have two expressions:

cos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)  [from vectors]
and
cosθ = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²)  [from triangle ABC]

We can use the triple angle formula for cosine:

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

So, substituting cosθ from equation (1):

cos(3θ) = 4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]

But we also have cos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

So, equate the two expressions:

4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)] = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

Let me denote t = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). Then, the equation becomes:

4t³ - 3t = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

But t = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). Let me express (1 - x²)/(1 + x²) in terms of t.

Let me compute (1 - x²)/(1 + x²):

Let me denote s = x². Then,

(1 - s)/(1 + s) = ?

But t = (121 - s)/(121 + s)

Let me solve for s in terms of t:

t = (121 - s)/(121 + s)

Cross-multiplying:

t(121 + s) = 121 - s

121t + ts = 121 - s

Bring terms with s to one side:

ts + s = 121 - 121t

s(t + 1) = 121(1 - t)

So,

s = [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1)

Now, (1 - s)/(1 + s) = [1 - s]/[1 + s] = [ (1 + s) - 2s ] / (1 + s) = 1 - [2s/(1 + s)]

But maybe it's better to express (1 - s)/(1 + s) in terms of t.

From s = [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1), then:

1 - s = 1 - [121(1 - t)] / (t + 1) = [ (t + 1) - 121(1 - t) ] / (t + 1 )

= [ t + 1 - 121 + 121t ] / (t + 1 )

= [ (1 + 121t) + (t - 121) ] / (t + 1 )

Wait, maybe better to compute numerator and denominator separately.

1 - s = 1 - [121(1 - t)/(t + 1)] = [ (t + 1) - 121(1 - t) ] / (t + 1 )

= [ t + 1 - 121 + 121t ] / (t + 1 )

= [ (t + 121t) + (1 - 121) ] / (t + 1 )

= [ 122t -","[122, '122']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the expression x⁴ + 4x² is a quartic polynomial, but it's actually a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it simpler. Let me try that.

Let y = x². Then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. So now I have a quadratic inequality in y. I can split this into two separate inequalities:

1. y² + 4y > -4
2. y² + 4y < 21

I'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions must be satisfied.

Starting with the first inequality: y² + 4y > -4.

Let me rewrite this as y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Wait, that's because I can add 4 to both sides to get y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, y² + 4y + 4 is a perfect square. It factors to (y + 2)² > 0.

So, (y + 2)² > 0. Since a square is always non-negative, this inequality holds for all real numbers except where the square is zero. So, y + 2 ≠ 0, which means y ≠ -2. But y is x², and x² is always non-negative, so y can't be negative. Therefore, y ≠ -2 is automatically satisfied because y is at least 0. So, the first inequality is always true for all real x. That means I don't have to worry about the first part; it doesn't restrict the solution set.

Now, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.

Let me rewrite this as y² + 4y - 21 < 0. To solve this quadratic inequality, I need to find the roots of the equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.

Calculating the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100. That's a perfect square, so the roots will be rational.

So, y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2.

Calculating both roots:

1. y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3
2. y = (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7

So, the roots are y = 3 and y = -7. Since the quadratic opens upwards (because the coefficient of y² is positive), the inequality y² + 4y - 21 < 0 will hold between the roots. That is, for y between -7 and 3.

But wait, y = x², which is always non-negative. So, y can't be less than 0. Therefore, the lower bound of y is 0, not -7. So, the solution for y is 0 ≤ y < 3.

Translating back to x, since y = x², we have 0 ≤ x² < 3. Taking square roots, this means that x is between -√3 and √3, but not including the endpoints because x² is strictly less than 3.

So, x must satisfy -√3 < x < √3.

But wait, let me double-check. The original inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. We transformed it into y² + 4y < 21, which gave us y < 3, and since y is non-negative, 0 ≤ y < 3. So, x² < 3, which gives x in (-√3, √3). That seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me test a value inside the interval and outside to make sure.

Let's pick x = 0. Then x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0. Is 0 between -4 and 21? Yes, so 0 is a valid solution.

Now, let's pick x = 2. Then x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32. Is 32 less than 21? No, so x = 2 is not a solution, which is consistent with our interval since 2 is greater than √3 (~1.732).

What about x = -2? Similarly, x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32, which is also not less than 21. So, x = -2 is excluded, which is correct.

How about x = √3? Then x² = 3, so x⁴ + 4x² = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so 21 is not included. Therefore, x cannot be √3 or -√3.

What about a number just less than √3, say x = 1.7? x² = 2.89, x⁴ = (2.89)² ≈ 8.3521. Then x⁴ + 4x² ≈ 8.3521 + 11.56 ≈ 19.9121, which is less than 21. So, that works.

And a number just above √3, say x = 1.8. x² = 3.24, x⁴ = (3.24)² ≈ 10.4976. Then x⁴ + 4x² ≈ 10.4976 + 12.96 ≈ 23.4576, which is greater than 21. So, that's excluded, which is correct.

Therefore, the solution set is all real numbers x such that -√3 < x < √3.

I think that's it. So, in interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, consider the inequality \(y^2 + 4y > -4\):
- Rewriting it as \(y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0\), we get \((y + 2)^2 > 0\).
- This is always true for all real \(y\) except \(y = -2\). Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, this condition is automatically satisfied.

Next, consider the inequality \(y^2 + 4y < 21\):
- Rewriting it as \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\), we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
  \[
  y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
  \]
  This gives the roots \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\).
- The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) holds for \( -7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, we have \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Translating back to \(x\), we get \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\), which means \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the solution in interval notation is \(\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}\).","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, okay. I remember that in problems involving symmetric equations, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or identities. Let me recall some relevant formulas.

First, I know that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) can be expressed in terms of \( x + y + z \), \( xy + yz + zx \), and \( xyz \). The formula is:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz
\]

Given that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \) and \( xyz = 4 \), maybe I can plug these into the formula. But wait, I don't know \( x + y + z \) or \( xy + yz + zx \) yet. Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). Then the equation becomes:

\[
4 = S^3 - 3S P + 3 \times 4
\]
\[
4 = S^3 - 3S P + 12
\]
\[
S^3 - 3S P = 4 - 12
\]
\[
S^3 - 3S P = -8
\]
So, equation (1): \( S^3 - 3S P = -8 \)

Now, looking at the third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or rewrite this expression.

I notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, \( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \). Similarly, \( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \), and \( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \). So, the entire expression can be written as:

\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12
\]

Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can factor it further or express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \). Let me try expanding each term:

First, \( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + x y^2 \), which is the same as the original terms. So, perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, another thought: I remember that \( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \). Let me write that down:

\[
(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz
\]

Looking at the third equation, it's \( x^2 y + x y^2 + x^2 z + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 = 12 \). So, that's exactly the left-hand side of the above equation minus \( 3xyz \). Therefore, we can write:

\[
(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12
\]

Substituting the known value of \( xyz = 4 \):

\[
S P - 3 \times 4 = 12
\]
\[
S P - 12 = 12
\]
\[
S P = 24
\]

So, equation (2): \( S P = 24 \)

Now, from equation (1): \( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \). But we know from equation (2) that \( S P = 24 \). Let's substitute that into equation (1):

\[
S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8
\]
\[
S^3 - 72 = -8
\]
\[
S^3 = 64
\]
\[
S = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4
\]

So, \( S = x + y + z = 4 \). Now, from equation (2): \( S P = 24 \), so:

\[
4 P = 24
\]
\[
P = 6
\]

Therefore, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I used the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) correctly, substituted the known values, and got \( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \).
2. Then, I looked at the third equation and recognized it as \( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz \), which led me to \( S P - 12 = 12 \), so \( S P = 24 \).
3. Substituted \( S P = 24 \) into the first equation, solved for \( S^3 = 64 \), so \( S = 4 \).
4. Then, \( P = 24 / 4 = 6 \).

Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in the reasoning. So, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is 6.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
</think>

Given the equations:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \):

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = (x + y + z)^3 - 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz
\]

Let \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
4 = S^3 - 3S P + 12
\]
\[
S^3 - 3S P = -8
\]

Next, we consider the third equation. Recognizing it as part of the expansion of \( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) \), we have:

\[
(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12
\]

Substituting \( xyz = 4 \):

\[
S P - 12 = 12
\]
\[
S P = 24
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \( S^3 - 3S P = -8 \)
2. \( S P = 24 \)

Substituting \( S P = 24 \) into the first equation:

\[
S^3 - 72 = -8
\]
\[
S^3 = 64
\]
\[
S = 4
\]

Using \( S = 4 \) in \( S P = 24 \):

\[
4 P = 24
\]
\[
P = 6
\]

Thus, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving fractions, I need to consider the numerator and the denominator separately because the sign of the fraction depends on the signs of both.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

Alright, so the numerator is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), and the denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\). I know that absolute values are always non-negative, so the numerator is either positive or zero. But since it's in the numerator, if it's zero, the whole expression becomes zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality because we're looking for values less than zero. So, I can note that the numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which is when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). At these points, the expression is zero, so they won't be part of the solution.

Next, let's factor both the numerator and the denominator to see if I can simplify or find critical points.

Starting with the numerator: \(|x^2 - 81|\). That's the absolute value of a difference of squares, so it factors as \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, as I thought earlier.

Now, the denominator: \(x^2 - 36x\). I can factor out an x, so it becomes \(x(x - 36)\). So, the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are important points because the expression is undefined at these values, so they can't be part of the solution either.

So, summarizing the critical points where the expression is zero or undefined: \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into intervals. I'll need to test each interval to see where the expression is negative.

The intervals are:

1. \( (-\infty, -9) \)
2. \( (-9, 0) \)
3. \( (0, 9) \)
4. \( (9, 36) \)
5. \( (36, \infty) \)

Now, I'll pick a test point from each interval and plug it into the expression to determine the sign.

Starting with the first interval, \( (-\infty, -9) \). Let's choose \(x = -10\).

Numerator: \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\) (positive)
Denominator: \((-10)^2 - 36*(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460\) (positive)
So, the expression is \(19/460\), which is positive. Since we're looking for negative values, this interval doesn't work.

Next interval: \( (-9, 0) \). Let's pick \(x = -5\).

Numerator: \(|(-5)^2 - 81| = |25 - 81| = | -56 | = 56\) (positive)
Denominator: \((-5)^2 - 36*(-5) = 25 + 180 = 205\) (positive)
So, the expression is \(56/205\), which is positive. Still not what we want.

Third interval: \( (0, 9) \). Let's choose \(x = 1\).

Numerator: \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = | -80 | = 80\) (positive)
Denominator: \(1^2 - 36*1 = 1 - 36 = -35\) (negative)
So, the expression is \(80/(-35)\), which is negative. This interval works because we're looking for where the expression is less than zero.

Fourth interval: \( (9, 36) \). Let's pick \(x = 10\).

Numerator: \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\) (positive)
Denominator: \(10^2 - 36*10 = 100 - 360 = -260\) (negative)
So, the expression is \(19/(-260)\), which is negative. This interval also works.

Fifth interval: \( (36, \infty) \). Let's choose \(x = 40\).

Numerator: \(|40^2 - 81| = |1600 - 81| = |1519| = 1519\) (positive)
Denominator: \(40^2 - 36*40 = 1600 - 1440 = 160\) (positive)
So, the expression is \(1519/160\), which is positive. Doesn't work.

So, from the test points, the expression is negative in intervals \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \). But wait, I should check if the expression is defined at the endpoints. At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined. At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined. So, the solution is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative, excluding the critical points.

But hold on, I should also consider the behavior around \(x = 9\). Since the numerator is zero there, but the denominator is \(9^2 - 36*9 = 81 - 324 = -243\), which is negative. So, just to the left of 9, the denominator is negative, and the numerator is positive, so the expression is negative. Just to the right of 9, the denominator is still negative because \(x = 10\) gives denominator as -260, which is negative, and numerator is positive, so expression is negative. So, the expression is negative on both sides of 9, but at 9 itself, it's zero. So, 9 is not included.

Similarly, at \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, but the denominator is \((-9)^2 - 36*(-9) = 81 + 324 = 405\), which is positive. So, just to the left of -9, the numerator is positive, denominator positive, so expression positive. Just to the right of -9, numerator is positive, denominator positive, so expression positive. So, -9 is not included.

At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so it's undefined. So, we have to exclude 0.

At \(x = 36\), denominator is zero, so undefined.

So, putting it all together, the solution is \(x\) in \( (0, 9) \) union \( (9, 36) \).

But wait, let me double-check. Is there any other point where the expression could change sign? I don't think so because the numerator is always positive except at x = 9 and x = -9, where it's zero, and the denominator changes sign at x = 0 and x = 36.

So, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is between 0 and 36, but excluding 0 and 36. But wait, in the interval \( (0, 9) \), the denominator is negative because \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). For x between 0 and 36, x is positive, but (x - 36) is negative, so the product is negative. So, denominator is negative in \( (0, 36) \). But the numerator is always positive except at x = 9 and x = -9.

So, in \( (0, 9) \), numerator is positive, denominator negative: expression negative.

In \( (9, 36) \), numerator is positive, denominator negative: expression negative.

So, the expression is negative in \( (0, 36) \), excluding the points where it's zero or undefined. But wait, at x = 9, the expression is zero, so we have to exclude that point. So, the solution is \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) \).

But wait, let me check if the numerator is positive in all these intervals. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative. So, it's positive except at x = 9 and x = -9. So, in all intervals except at those points, the numerator is positive.

So, the sign of the expression depends solely on the denominator. So, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is when \(x^2 - 36x < 0\). Let's solve that inequality separately.

\(x^2 - 36x < 0\)

Factor: \(x(x - 36) < 0\)

This is a quadratic inequality. The critical points are x = 0 and x = 36. The parabola opens upwards, so it's negative between the roots. So, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\).

But in this interval, we have to exclude the points where the numerator is zero, which is x = 9 and x = -9. But x = -9 is not in this interval, so only x = 9 is in \(0 < x < 36\). So, we have to exclude x = 9.

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) excluding x = 9, which is \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) \).

So, putting it all together, the solution set is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 0, 9, and 36.

I think that's it. Let me just recap:

- The numerator is always non-negative, zero at x = 9 and x = -9.

- The expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is between 0 and 36.

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular field that's surrounded by a running track. The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. I need to find the maximum possible area of the field. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch it out in my mind. The field is a rectangle, so it has two lengths and two widths. The track goes around it, but instead of just the rectangle's perimeter, it's made up of two straight parts and two semicircular parts. So, the track is like a rectangle with semicircles on each end, right? That makes the track a combination of straight lines and curves.

Wait, actually, if the track is surrounding the field, then the straight parts of the track would be the same as the lengths of the rectangle, and the curved parts would be the semicircles on each end. So, the total length of the track would be the sum of the two straight sides and the circumference of the two semicircles.

Let me denote the length of the rectangle as 'L' and the width as 'W'. Then, the two straight parts of the track would each be length 'L', so together that's 2L. The two semicircular parts would each have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 'W'. Since each semicircle has a circumference of π*(diameter)/2, which is π*W/2. But since there are two semicircles, together they make a full circle, so the total circumference from the curves would be π*W.

So, the total length of the track is 2L + π*W = 400 meters. That's the constraint given.

Now, the area of the field is the area of the rectangle, which is L*W. I need to maximize this area given the constraint 2L + π*W = 400.

This sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember from calculus that I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or substitution to solve such problems. Since it's a single constraint, substitution might be simpler here.

Let me express L in terms of W from the constraint equation. So, 2L = 400 - π*W, which means L = (400 - π*W)/2.

Now, substitute this into the area formula: Area = L*W = [(400 - π*W)/2] * W = (400W - π*W²)/2.

So, the area A(W) = (400W - π*W²)/2. To find the maximum area, I need to find the value of W that maximizes A(W). This is a quadratic function in terms of W, and since the coefficient of W² is negative (-π/2), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

The vertex of a parabola given by A(W) = aW² + bW + c is at W = -b/(2a). In this case, A(W) = (-π/2)W² + (400/2)W, so a = -π/2 and b = 200.

So, W = -b/(2a) = -200 / (2*(-π/2)) = -200 / (-π) = 200/π.

Wait, let me double-check that calculation. The standard form is A(W) = aW² + bW + c, so here a = -π/2 and b = 200. So, the vertex is at W = -b/(2a) = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = -200/(-π) = 200/π. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the width W that maximizes the area is 200/π meters. Now, let's find the corresponding length L.

From earlier, L = (400 - π*W)/2. Plugging W = 200/π into this:

L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100 meters.

So, the length is 100 meters and the width is 200/π meters. Now, let's compute the area.

Area = L*W = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π square meters.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify the calculations again.

Starting from the constraint: 2L + πW = 400.

If W = 200/π, then πW = 200. So, 2L = 400 - 200 = 200, so L = 100. That seems correct.

Then, area is 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π. Yes, that's approximately 6366.1977 square meters, but since the question asks for the exact value, I should leave it in terms of π.

Alternatively, maybe I can express it as (20000/π) m². But let me think if there's another way to represent it.

Wait, another approach: sometimes, when dealing with such optimization problems, especially with circles and rectangles, the maximum area occurs when the shape is as close to a square as possible, but in this case, because of the semicircular ends, it's a bit different.

But in this case, the calculations seem consistent. Let me just recap:

1. The track is made of two straight sides (each length L) and two semicircular ends (each with diameter W).
2. The total length of the track is 2L + πW = 400.
3. The area of the field is L*W.
4. Express L in terms of W: L = (400 - πW)/2.
5. Substitute into area: A = (400W - πW²)/2.
6. Take derivative of A with respect to W: dA/dW = (400 - 2πW)/2 = 200 - πW.
7. Set derivative to zero: 200 - πW = 0 → W = 200/π.
8. Then L = 100.
9. Area = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.

Yes, that all checks out. So, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let's go through the steps again quickly.

- Total track length: 2L + πW = 400.
- Express L: L = (400 - πW)/2.
- Area: A = L*W = [(400 - πW)/2]*W = (400W - πW²)/2.
- To maximize A, take derivative: dA/dW = (400 - 2πW)/2 = 200 - πW.
- Set to zero: 200 - πW = 0 → W = 200/π.
- Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100.
- Area = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.

Yes, everything seems consistent. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning or calculations. So, the maximum area is 20000 divided by π square meters.
</think>

The maximum area of the field is achieved when the width is \( \frac{200}{\pi} \) meters and the length is 100 meters. The area is calculated as:

\[
\text{Area} = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \text{ square meters}

"Okay, so I have this problem about triangle RST where angle R is given, and I need to find sin T. Hmm, let me try to visualize the triangle first. The Asymptote code shows that it's a right-angled triangle with the right angle at S. So, points R, S, and T form a right triangle with the right angle at S. That means angle R and angle T are the other two angles, and they must add up to 90 degrees since the total in a triangle is 180.

The Asymptote code also labels the hypotenuse RT as 5 units long. So, RT is the hypotenuse, and RS and ST are the legs. Since it's a right-angled triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem here if needed.

Given that sin R is 2/5, I need to find sin T. Let me recall that in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, sin R = opposite side / hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle R would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So, sin R = ST / RT = 2/5. That means ST = 2 units because 2/5 of 5 is 2.

Wait, hold on. If RT is 5 and sin R is 2/5, then ST is 2. So, ST = 2. Now, since it's a right-angled triangle at S, the sides RS and ST are the legs, and RT is the hypotenuse. So, I can find RS using the Pythagorean theorem. Let me write that down:

RS² + ST² = RT²

We know ST is 2 and RT is 5, so plugging in:

RS² + 2² = 5²
RS² + 4 = 25
RS² = 25 - 4
RS² = 21
RS = sqrt(21)

Okay, so RS is sqrt(21). Now, I need to find sin T. Let's think about angle T. In triangle RST, angle T is at point T, so the sides relative to angle T are: the opposite side is RS, and the hypotenuse is RT. So, sin T = opposite / hypotenuse = RS / RT.

We already found RS is sqrt(21) and RT is 5, so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me double-check. Angle R is at point R, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle R are ST and RS, respectively. Since sin R = 2/5, that's opposite over hypotenuse, so ST is 2, hypotenuse is 5, so RS is sqrt(21). Then, for angle T, which is at point T, the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is still RT, which is 5. So, yes, sin T should be sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, since in a right-angled triangle, the two non-right angles are complementary, meaning angle R + angle T = 90 degrees. So, sin T would be equal to cos R. Because sin(90 - x) = cos x. So, if sin R = 2/5, then cos R would be sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, sin T = cos R = sqrt(21)/5. That confirms my earlier result.

So, I think that's the answer. Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Given sin R = 2/5 in a right-angled triangle, we found the opposite side ST = 2, hypotenuse RT = 5, then used Pythagoras to find RS = sqrt(21). Then, since sin T is opposite over hypotenuse for angle T, which is RS / RT = sqrt(21)/5. Alternatively, using the co-function identity, sin T = cos R, which also gives sqrt(21)/5. Both methods lead to the same answer, so I feel confident.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.
</think>

Given a right-angled triangle \( \triangle RST \) with the right angle at \( S \), we know that \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \). We need to find \( \sin{T} \).

1. In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle \( R \), the opposite side is \( ST \) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \). Given \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \), we have:
   \[
   \sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
   \]
   Therefore, \( ST = 2 \) and \( RT = 5 \).

2. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( RS \):
   \[
   RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   RS^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
   \]
   \[
   RS^2 + 4 = 25
   \]
   \[
   RS^2 = 21
   \]
   \[
   RS = \sqrt{21}
   \]

3. To find \( \sin{T} \), we note that the opposite side to angle \( T \) is \( RS \) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \). Thus:
   \[
   \sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
   \]

4. Additionally, since angles \( R \) and \( T \) are complementary, \( \sin{T} = \cos{R} \). Calculating \( \cos{R} \):
   \[
   \cos{R} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2{R}} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
   \]

Thus, the value of \( \sin{T} \) is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The answer needs to be expressed in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. Then, I have to find \( a + b \).

Hmm, okay. So, the shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But since one of the points is variable (any point on the graph), I think I need to use calculus to minimize the distance function.

Let me recall that the distance between two points \( (x, y) \) and \( (0, 0) \) is given by \( \sqrt{(x - 0)^2 + (y - 0)^2} \), which simplifies to \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since the point \( (x, y) \) lies on the given graph, I can substitute \( y \) with the function \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \).

So, substituting, the distance becomes \( \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \). To make it easier, I can square the distance to avoid dealing with the square root, which should give me the same minimum point. So, let me define a function \( D(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \).

Simplifying \( D(x) \):

First, square the second term: \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \).

So, \( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \).

Now, I need to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( D(x) \). To do this, I'll take the derivative of \( D(x) \) with respect to \( x \), set it equal to zero, and solve for \( x \).

Let's compute \( D'(x) \):

First, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \) to make differentiation easier. \( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \).

So, \( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \).

Simplify:

\( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \).

Combine like terms:

\( D(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \).

Now, take the derivative:

\( D'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) \).

Calculating term by term:

- The derivative of \( \frac{1}{2}x^4 \) is \( 2x^3 \).
- The derivative of \( -2x^2 \) is \( -4x \).
- The derivative of \( \frac{9}{2} \) is 0.

So, \( D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \).

To find critical points, set \( D'(x) = 0 \):

\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \).

Factor out 2x:

\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \).

So, the solutions are \( x = 0 \) or \( x^2 - 2 = 0 \) which gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum distance. Since distance is always positive, I can evaluate \( D(x) \) at each critical point and see which is the smallest.

First, evaluate at \( x = 0 \):

\( D(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \).

Next, evaluate at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

Compute \( D(\sqrt{2}) \):

First, \( x^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^2 = 4 \).

\( x^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

So, \( D(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = (-2) + 4.5 = 2.5 \).

Similarly, \( D(-\sqrt{2}) \) will be the same as \( D(\sqrt{2}) \) because all terms are even powers, so it's also 2.5.

So, comparing \( D(0) = 4.5 \) and \( D(\sqrt{2}) = 2.5 \), clearly \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \) give a smaller distance.

Therefore, the minimal distance occurs at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). Let's pick \( x = \sqrt{2} \) for simplicity.

Now, compute the distance at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

First, find \( y \):

\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( (\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

So, the point is \( (\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).

Now, compute the distance from the origin:

\( \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 } = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{ \frac{4}{2} + \frac{1}{2} } = \sqrt{ \frac{5}{2} } \).

Simplify \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \):

\( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\( \frac{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

So, the minimal distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since 10 is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, this satisfies the condition.

Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I computed \( D(x) \) at \( x = \sqrt{2} \), I got 2.5, which is \( \frac{5}{2} \). So, the squared distance is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \). That seems correct.

But let me verify the point on the graph. When \( x = \sqrt{2} \), \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( (\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). So, the point is \( (\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2}) \). The distance from the origin is indeed \( \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 1/2} = \sqrt{5/2} = \sqrt{10}/2 \). So, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using the formula for the distance from a point to a curve. But I think the method I used is correct.

Alternatively, another way is to parametrize the point on the curve as \( (x, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)) \) and then find the minimum distance squared, which is \( x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \). Then, take the derivative, set to zero, which is exactly what I did.

So, I think my answer is correct. Therefore, \( a = 10 \), \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{12}.
</think>

To find the shortest distance between the origin and a point on the graph \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance function. The distance between the origin \((0, 0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph is given by:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

To simplify, we square the distance function:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2
\]

Simplifying further:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]

Expanding and combining like terms:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Taking the derivative of \( D(x) \) with respect to \( x \):

\[
D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0 \implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \implies x = 0, \pm\sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluating \( D(x) \) at these critical points:

- \( D(0) = \frac{9}{2} \)
- \( D(\sqrt{2}) = D(-\sqrt{2}) = 2.5 \)

The minimum distance occurs at \( x = \pm\sqrt{2} \). For \( x = \sqrt{2} \), the corresponding \( y \)-coordinate is:

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

The distance from the origin is:

\[
\sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 } = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, the shortest distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3, and it's -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3. I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, that sounds like I need to find the values of x such that f(x) equals 0 and 6, respectively, and then add those x values together.

Let me start with f inverse of 0. That means I need to solve f(x) = 0. Since f is piecewise, I have to check both pieces.

First, for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. So, set that equal to 0:

3 - x = 0

Solving for x, I get x = 3. Okay, so that's one solution. But wait, I should check if this x is within the domain of that piece, which is x ≤ 3. Since 3 is equal to 3, it's valid. So, f inverse of 0 is 3.

But hold on, maybe there's another solution in the other piece? Let me check the second piece for f(x) = 0 as well. The second piece is for x > 3, so f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let me set that equal to 0:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0

I can factor out a -x:

-x(x² - 2x - 3) = 0

So, either -x = 0, which gives x = 0, but x has to be greater than 3 here, so that's not valid. Or, x² - 2x - 3 = 0. Let's solve that quadratic equation.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2.

So, x = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or x = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1. Hmm, both 3 and -1. But in this piece, x has to be greater than 3, so x = 3 is the boundary, but it's not included in this piece. So, x = 3 is already covered in the first piece, and x = -1 is less than 3, so it's not in the domain of this piece either. Therefore, the only solution is x = 3.

So, f inverse of 0 is 3.

Now, moving on to f inverse of 6. Again, I need to solve f(x) = 6. Let's check both pieces.

First, for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. So, set that equal to 6:

3 - x = 6

Solving for x: -x = 6 - 3 = 3, so x = -3. Now, check if x = -3 is in the domain x ≤ 3. Yes, it is. So, that's a valid solution. So, f inverse of 6 is -3? Wait, hold on, is that the only solution?

Wait, maybe there's another solution in the second piece. Let me check the second piece for f(x) = 6 as well. The second piece is for x > 3, so f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Set that equal to 6:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Let me rearrange that:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Now, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor by grouping.

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(x³ - 2x²) + (-3x + 6) = 0

Factor out x² from the first group and -3 from the second group:

x²(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0

Now, factor out (x - 2):

(x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0

So, the solutions are x = 2 or x² - 3 = 0, which gives x = sqrt(3) or x = -sqrt(3). But wait, in this piece, x has to be greater than 3. So, x = 2 is less than 3, so it's not in the domain. Similarly, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, which is less than 3, and -sqrt(3) is negative, so also less than 3. Therefore, none of these solutions are valid in the second piece.

So, the only solution is x = -3 from the first piece. Therefore, f inverse of 6 is -3.

Wait, hold on a second. Let me double-check my factoring. I had:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

I multiplied by -1 to get x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Then, grouping:

(x³ - 2x²) + (-3x + 6) = 0

x²(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0

So, (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0

Yes, that seems correct. So, the roots are x = 2, x = sqrt(3), x = -sqrt(3). None of these are greater than 3, so indeed, no solution in the second piece. So, f inverse of 6 is -3.

Therefore, f inverse of 0 is 3, and f inverse of 6 is -3. So, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

For f inverse of 0, I found x = 3, which is correct because f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0. And for f inverse of 6, I found x = -3, because f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6. So, that's correct.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions in the second piece for f(x) = 6. Maybe I made a mistake in factoring or solving.

So, starting again with f(x) = 6 for x > 3:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Bring 6 to the left:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

Multiply by -1:

x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Trying to factor this, maybe I can use rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Testing x=1: 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0

x=2: 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, wait, x=2 is a root. So, I can factor (x - 2) out.

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 by (x - 2).

Using synthetic division:

2 | 1  -2  -3  6

          2   0  -6

      1   0  -3  0

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² - 3). So, same as before. So, roots are x=2, x=√3, x=-√3. None of these are greater than 3, so no solution in the second piece.

Therefore, f inverse of 6 is indeed -3.

So, adding f inverse of 0 (which is 3) and f inverse of 6 (which is -3) gives 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a possibility that f(x) = 6 could have another solution in the second piece? Maybe I should graph the function or analyze its behavior.

For x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's see its behavior as x increases beyond 3.

As x approaches infinity, the -x³ term dominates, so f(x) tends to negative infinity. At x=3, let's compute f(3):

f(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, at x=3, f(x)=0. Then, as x increases beyond 3, f(x) starts at 0 and goes to negative infinity. So, it's decreasing for x > 3.

Wait, is that true? Let me check the derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.

f'(x) for x > 3 is derivative of -x³ + 2x² + 3x, which is -3x² + 4x + 3.

At x=3, f'(3) = -27 + 12 + 3 = -12. So, the slope is negative at x=3, meaning it's decreasing there. Since the leading term is -3x², which is negative, the function is concave down and decreasing for large x. So, it's decreasing for x > 3, starting from f(3)=0 and going down. Therefore, f(x) for x > 3 never reaches 6 because it's decreasing from 0 to negative infinity. So, no solution in the second piece for f(x)=6.

Therefore, my earlier conclusion is correct. f inverse of 6 is -3.

So, adding f inverse of 0 (3) and f inverse of 6 (-3) gives 0.

Wait, but let me just confirm f(-3):

f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6, correct.

And f(3) = 0, correct.

So, yeah, the sum is 0.

I think that's the answer.
</think>

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise. To find \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \), we solve for \( x \) in each piece.

For \( f^{-1}(0) \):
- In the first piece (\( x \leq 3 \)): \( 3 - x = 0 \) gives \( x = 3 \).
- In the second piece (\( x > 3 \)): Solving \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \) yields no valid solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( f^{-1}(6) \):
- In the first piece (\( x \leq 3 \)): \( 3 - x = 6 \) gives \( x = -3 \).
- In the second piece (\( x > 3 \)): Solving \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \) yields no valid solutions for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results: \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

"Alright, so I have this problem about a regular octahedron, which is a polyhedron with eight triangular faces, right? It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases. The problem says that from point P, the distances to five of the six vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex.

Hmm, okay. Let me think about the properties of a regular octahedron. I remember that in a regular octahedron, all edges are of equal length, and it's symmetric. The vertices can be considered as points in 3D space. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the vertices to make this easier.

I recall that a regular octahedron can be embedded in 3D space with vertices at (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,-1). So, let me denote these points as A, B, C, D, E, F respectively. So, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), and F is (0,0,-1).

Now, point P is somewhere in space, and the distances from P to five of these vertices are given. Let me denote the coordinates of P as (x, y, z). Then, the distance from P to each vertex can be written using the distance formula.

So, the distance from P to A is sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 3.

Similarly, the distance from P to B is sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 7.

Distance to C is sqrt[x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] = 8.

Distance to D is sqrt[x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] = 9.

Distance to E is sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] = 11.

And the distance to F is sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2], which is what we need to find.

Hmm, okay. So, I have five equations here with three variables x, y, z. That seems overdetermined, but maybe there's a relationship or a trick to find the sixth distance without solving for x, y, z directly.

Wait, I remember something about the properties of regular octahedrons and the sum of squares of distances from a point to all vertices. Is there a formula or theorem related to that?

Let me think. For a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to all six vertices is constant, regardless of where the point is. Is that true? Or is it something else?

Wait, actually, I think it's related to the concept of the moment of inertia or something in geometry. Maybe the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to all vertices is equal to a constant plus six times the square of the distance from the point to the centroid.

But in a regular octahedron, the centroid is at the origin (0,0,0) because of the symmetry. So, if that's the case, then the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices should be equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the centroid plus some constant.

Wait, let me recall the formula. For any point P in space, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex of a regular polyhedron can be expressed in terms of the number of vertices, the distance from P to the centroid, and some constant related to the polyhedron.

Specifically, for a regular octahedron, the formula is:

Sum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P - G|^2 + C,

where G is the centroid, and C is a constant depending on the octahedron.

Since the centroid G is at (0,0,0), this simplifies to:

Sum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P|^2 + C.

But I need to find what C is. Let me compute the sum of the squares of the distances from the origin to each vertex.

Each vertex is at a distance of 1 from the origin, right? Because the coordinates are (1,0,0), etc. So, the distance from the origin to each vertex is 1, so the square is 1. There are six vertices, so the sum is 6*1 = 6.

But wait, in the formula, it's 6|P|^2 + C. So, if I plug in P as the origin, then the sum of the squares of the distances from the origin to each vertex is 6, which should equal 6|0|^2 + C, so C = 6.

Therefore, the formula is:

Sum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P|^2 + 6.

So, if I can compute the sum of the squares of the given distances, and then use this formula to find the sixth distance.

Let me write that down.

Let me denote the distances as d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D, d_E, d_F.

Given: d_A = 3, d_B = 7, d_C = 8, d_D = 9, d_E = 11, and d_F is unknown.

So, the sum of squares is 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_F^2.

Compute that:

3^2 = 9

7^2 = 49

8^2 = 64

9^2 = 81

11^2 = 121

So, sum of the known squares: 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121.

Let me add them step by step:

9 + 49 = 58

58 + 64 = 122

122 + 81 = 203

203 + 121 = 324

So, the sum of the squares of the known distances is 324. Then, adding d_F^2, the total sum is 324 + d_F^2.

According to the formula, this should equal 6|P|^2 + 6.

But wait, I don't know |P|, which is the distance from P to the origin. Hmm, but maybe I can express |P|^2 in terms of the given distances.

Wait, let's think again. The formula is:

Sum_{i=1 to 6} |P - V_i|^2 = 6|P|^2 + 6.

So, 324 + d_F^2 = 6|P|^2 + 6.

But I don't know |P|^2. Is there another way to find |P|^2?

Alternatively, maybe I can find |P|^2 from the given distances.

Wait, let's consider the distance from P to A: sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 3.

Squaring both sides: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.

Similarly, distance to B: sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 7.

Squaring: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.

If I subtract the first equation from the second, I can eliminate y^2 and z^2.

So, (x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9.

Compute left side: (x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x.

Right side: 40.

So, 4x = 40 => x = 10.

Wait, that's interesting. So, x = 10.

Wait, but hold on, if x is 10, then let's plug back into the first equation.

From distance to A: (10 - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.

So, 9^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => 81 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => y^2 + z^2 = 9 - 81 = -72.

Wait, that can't be. y^2 + z^2 can't be negative. That doesn't make sense. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, let's check the subtraction again.

(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9.

Compute left side: (x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x.

Right side: 40.

So, 4x = 40 => x = 10.

But then, plugging back into the first equation:

(10 - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => 81 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => y^2 + z^2 = -72.

Which is impossible because squares are non-negative. So, that suggests that my initial assumption is wrong.

Wait, maybe I messed up the formula. Let me double-check.

Wait, the distance from P to A is sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 3.

So, squaring: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.

Similarly, distance to B: sqrt[(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 7.

Squaring: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.

Subtracting the first equation from the second:

[(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2] = 49 - 9.

Which is 4x = 40 => x = 10.

But then, as before, plugging back in, we get y^2 + z^2 = -72, which is impossible.

Hmm, so that suggests that either the problem is impossible, or I made a wrong assumption.

Wait, but the problem says that such a point P exists, so maybe I made a wrong assumption in the formula.

Wait, perhaps the formula I recalled earlier is incorrect. Let me think again.

Wait, maybe the formula is different. Let me recall that for any point P, the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the centroid plus 6 times the square of the edge length or something like that.

Wait, actually, let me think about the general formula for the sum of squared distances from a point to the vertices of a polyhedron.

In general, for any point P, the sum of squared distances to the vertices can be expressed as:

Sum |P - V_i|^2 = n |P - G|^2 + Sum |V_i - G|^2,

where G is the centroid, and n is the number of vertices.

In this case, n = 6, and G is the origin.

So, Sum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + Sum |V_i|^2.

But each V_i is at a distance of 1 from the origin, so |V_i|^2 = 1 for each vertex.

Therefore, Sum |V_i|^2 = 6 * 1 = 6.

So, the formula is:

Sum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + 6.

So, that's correct.

Therefore, Sum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + 6.

So, in our case, the sum of the squares of the distances is 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_F^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d_F^2 = 324 + d_F^2.

So, 324 + d_F^2 = 6 |P|^2 + 6.

But we also have that |P|^2 is x^2 + y^2 + z^2.

Wait, but from the distance to A: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.

Expanding that: x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9.

Which is |P|^2 - 2x + 1 = 9.

So, |P|^2 = 9 + 2x - 1 = 8 + 2x.

Similarly, from the distance to B: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.

Expanding: x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49.

Which is |P|^2 + 2x + 1 = 49.

So, |P|^2 = 49 - 2x - 1 = 48 - 2x.

So, from distance to A: |P|^2 = 8 + 2x.

From distance to B: |P|^2 = 48 - 2x.

Therefore, 8 + 2x = 48 - 2x.

Solving for x:

8 + 2x = 48 - 2x

2x + 2x = 48 - 8

4x = 40

x = 10.

Wait, so x is 10, which is what I got earlier. But then, plugging back into |P|^2 = 8 + 2x = 8 + 20 = 28.

So, |P|^2 = 28.

But then, from the distance to A: (10 - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => 81 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 => y^2 + z^2 = -72.

Which is impossible. So, that suggests that there is no such point P with these distances. But the problem says that such a point exists, so I must have made a mistake.

Wait, maybe I misapplied the formula. Let me check the formula again.

Wait, the formula is Sum |P - V_i|^2 = 6 |P|^2 + ","[6, '6']",\sqrt{66},[],True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find how many common digits there are between the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number 629. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I remember that to convert a decimal number to another base, I can use the division method where I divide the number by the base and keep track of the remainders. These remainders become the digits of the number in the new base, starting from the least significant digit.

So, I need to convert 629 into base 7 and base 8 separately and then compare the digits to see how many are the same.

Let me start with converting 629 to base 7.

**Converting 629 to Base 7:**

I'll divide 629 by 7 and record the remainders.

1. 629 ÷ 7: 7 goes into 629 how many times? Let's see, 7*89 is 623, which is less than 629. So, 89 times with a remainder of 629 - 623 = 6. So, the first remainder is 6.

2. Now, take 89 and divide by 7. 7*12 is 84, so 12 times with a remainder of 89 - 84 = 5. Second remainder is 5.

3. Next, take 12 and divide by 7. 7*1 is 7, so 1 time with a remainder of 12 - 7 = 5. Third remainder is 5.

4. Now, take 1 and divide by 7. 7 goes into 1 zero times, so the remainder is 1. Fourth remainder is 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first, the base 7 representation is 1 5 5 6. So, 629 in base 7 is 1556₇.

Wait, let me double-check that. Let me compute 1*7³ + 5*7² + 5*7 + 6.

1*343 = 343

5*49 = 245

5*7 = 35

6*1 = 6

Adding them up: 343 + 245 = 588, 588 + 35 = 623, 623 + 6 = 629. Yes, that's correct.

**Converting 629 to Base 8:**

Now, I'll do the same process for base 8.

1. 629 ÷ 8: 8*78 is 624, so 78 times with a remainder of 629 - 624 = 5. First remainder is 5.

2. Take 78 and divide by 8. 8*9 is 72, so 9 times with a remainder of 78 - 72 = 6. Second remainder is 6.

3. Take 9 and divide by 8. 8*1 is 8, so 1 time with a remainder of 9 - 8 = 1. Third remainder is 1.

4. Take 1 and divide by 8. 8 goes into 1 zero times, so the remainder is 1. Fourth remainder is 1.

So, writing the remainders from last to first, the base 8 representation is 1 1 6 5. So, 629 in base 8 is 1165₈.

Wait, let me verify that as well. 1*8³ + 1*8² + 6*8 + 5.

1*512 = 512

1*64 = 64

6*8 = 48

5*1 = 5

Adding them up: 512 + 64 = 576, 576 + 48 = 624, 624 + 5 = 629. Correct.

**Comparing the Digits:**

Now, I have the two numbers:

- Base 7: 1 5 5 6
- Base 8: 1 1 6 5

I need to compare each digit position to see if they are the same.

Let me write them aligned:

Base 7: 1 (thousands place), 5 (hundreds), 5 (tens), 6 (units)
Base 8: 1 (thousands place), 1 (hundreds), 6 (tens), 5 (units)

Wait, actually, in base 7, the digits are 1,5,5,6, which correspond to 7³, 7², 7¹, 7⁰.

Similarly, in base 8, the digits are 1,1,6,5, corresponding to 8³, 8², 8¹, 8⁰.

So, let's list them:

Base 7 digits: [1, 5, 5, 6]
Base 8 digits: [1, 1, 6, 5]

Now, let's compare each digit position by position:

1. Thousands place: Both have 1. So, that's a match.
2. Hundreds place: Base7 has 5, Base8 has 1. Not a match.
3. Tens place: Base7 has 5, Base8 has 6. Not a match.
4. Units place: Base7 has 6, Base8 has 5. Not a match.

Wait, but wait, maybe I should consider the digits regardless of their position? Or is it per digit position?

Wait, the question says ""the same digits"" in their respective representations. So, perhaps it's the digits themselves, regardless of their position. So, for example, in the example given, 121_3 and 413_5, the common digit is 1, which appears in both.

So, in that case, I need to look at all the digits in both numbers and see how many unique digits are common between them.

So, let's list the digits in each base:

Base7: 1,5,5,6 → digits are 1,5,6

Base8: 1,1,6,5 → digits are 1,5,6

So, the digits in base7 are {1,5,6}, and in base8 are {1,5,6}. So, all three digits are common.

Wait, but wait, in the example, 121_3 has digits 1 and 2, and 413_5 has digits 4,1,3. So, the common digit is 1, hence one common digit.

So, in this case, the digits in base7 are 1,5,5,6, so unique digits are 1,5,6.

Digits in base8 are 1,1,6,5, so unique digits are 1,5,6.

So, the common digits are 1,5,6. So, three digits.

Wait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three. So, the answer would be 3.

But wait, let me make sure I'm interpreting the question correctly. The question says, ""the same digits"" in their respective representations. So, it's the number of digits that appear in both representations, regardless of their position.

So, in the example, 121_3 has digits 1 and 2, and 413_5 has digits 4,1,3. So, the common digit is 1, hence one.

In our case, base7 has digits 1,5,6, and base8 has digits 1,5,6. So, all three digits are common. So, the number of common digits is 3.

Wait, but let me check the base7 and base8 representations again.

Base7: 1556 → digits are 1,5,5,6. So, unique digits: 1,5,6.

Base8: 1165 → digits are 1,1,6,5. So, unique digits: 1,5,6.

So, yes, all three digits are common. So, the answer is 3.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.

Base7: 629 ÷7=89 rem6; 89 ÷7=12 rem5; 12 ÷7=1 rem5; 1 ÷7=0 rem1. So, digits are 1,5,5,6.

Base8: 629 ÷8=78 rem5; 78 ÷8=9 rem6; 9 ÷8=1 rem1; 1 ÷8=0 rem1. So, digits are 1,1,6,5.

Yes, that's correct.

So, the digits in base7 are 1,5,6, and in base8 are 1,5,6. So, all three digits are common.

Therefore, the number of common digits is 3.

Wait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three. So, the answer is 3.

But let me think again. The example says 121_3 and 413_5 have one common digit, which is 1. So, the count is the number of unique digits that appear in both representations.

In our case, the unique digits in base7 are 1,5,6, and in base8 are 1,5,6. So, all three are common. So, the count is 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, base7: 1*343 +5*49 +5*7 +6= 343+245=588+35=623+6=629. Correct.

Base8:1*512 +1*64 +6*8 +5=512+64=576+48=624+5=629. Correct.

So, the digits are correct.

Therefore, the number of common digits is 3.

Wait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three. So, the answer is 3.

But wait, let me think again. The example says 121_3 and 413_5 have one common digit, which is 1. So, the count is the number of unique digits that appear in both representations.

In our case, the unique digits in base7 are 1,5,6, and in base8 are 1,5,6. So, all three are common. So, the count is 3.

Therefore, the answer is 3.

Wait, but wait, in the example, the count was one, but in this case, it's three. So, the answer is 3.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion.

Wait, base7: 1*343 +5*49 +5*7 +6= 343+245=588+35=623+6=629. Correct.

Base8:1*512 +1*64 +6*8 +5=512+64=576+48=624+5=629. Correct.

So, the digits are correct.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a polynomial f(x) = 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. I need to find the sum of the coefficients of another polynomial g(x), which is equal to f(x - 1). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial is found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. So, if I have a polynomial like g(x) = aₙxⁿ + ... + a₁x + a₀, then the sum of its coefficients is g(1) = aₙ + ... + a₁ + a₀. That makes sense because plugging in x = 1 essentially removes all the x terms, leaving just the coefficients.

So, if g(x) is equal to f(x - 1), then the sum of the coefficients of g(x) would be g(1). But since g(x) = f(x - 1), substituting x = 1 into g(x) would give me f(1 - 1) = f(0). Wait, is that right? Let me double-check.

Yes, because g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). So, instead of expanding f(x - 1) and then plugging in x = 1, I can just compute f(0). That seems much simpler. Let me verify this logic.

Alternatively, if I were to expand f(x - 1), I would substitute x - 1 into every x in f(x). So, f(x - 1) would be 3(x - 1)⁴ + 5(x - 1)² - 9(x - 1) - 2. Then, to find the sum of the coefficients, I would set x = 1 in this expanded polynomial. But if I do that, each (x - 1) term becomes (1 - 1) = 0, so f(0) is indeed the result. So, both methods lead to the same conclusion.

Therefore, I can just compute f(0) to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x). Let's compute f(0):

f(0) = 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2.

Wait, so the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2? That seems straightforward, but let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make a mistake.

Alternatively, if I were to expand f(x - 1) fully, what would that look like? Let me try that to confirm.

First, expand each term:

1. 3(x - 1)^4: Let's compute (x - 1)^4. Using the binomial theorem, (x - 1)^4 = x^4 - 4x³ + 6x² - 4x + 1. Multiply by 3: 3x⁴ - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3.

2. 5(x - 1)^2: (x - 1)^2 = x² - 2x + 1. Multiply by 5: 5x² - 10x + 5.

3. -9(x - 1): Distribute the -9: -9x + 9.

4. -2: That's just -2.

Now, let's add all these together:

3x⁴ - 12x³ + 18x² - 12x + 3
+ 5x² - 10x + 5
-9x + 9
-2

Combine like terms:

- x⁴ term: 3x⁴
- x³ term: -12x³
- x² terms: 18x² + 5x² = 23x²
- x terms: -12x -10x -9x = -31x
- constants: 3 + 5 + 9 - 2 = 15

So, f(x - 1) = 3x⁴ - 12x³ + 23x² - 31x + 15.

Now, the sum of the coefficients is found by plugging in x = 1:

g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15.

Let's compute that step by step:

3 - 12 = -9

-9 + 23 = 14

14 - 31 = -17

-17 + 15 = -2.

So, that confirms it. The sum of the coefficients is indeed -2. Therefore, whether I compute f(0) directly or expand f(x - 1) and then evaluate at x = 1, I get the same result.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the answer should be -2.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \boxed{-2}.
</think>

To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is equal to \( f(x - 1) \), we can evaluate \( g(1) \). Since \( g(x) = f(x - 1) \), we have \( g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) \).

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we compute \( f(0) \):

\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2
\]

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"먼저, 점 (6, 0)에서 직선 y = 2x - 2까지의 최단 거리를 구하기 위해 직선의 기울기를 확인합니다. 직선의 기울기는 2입니다.

다음으로, 주어진 점을 통과하는 수직선의 기울기는 원래 직선의 기울기의 음의 역수인 -1/2가 됩니다.

이제, 수직선의 방정식을 구합니다. 점 (6, 0)을 통과하며 기울기가 -1/2인 수직선의 방정식은 y = (-1/2)x + 3입니다.

두 직선 y = 2x - 2와 y = (-1/2)x + 3의 교점을 구합니다. 이를 위해 두 방정식을 연립하여 풀면 x = 2, y = 2를 얻습니다.

마지막으로, 점 (6, 0)과 교점 (2, 2) 사이의 거리를 계산합니다. 거리 공식을 사용하여 √[(6-2)² + (0-2)²] = √(16 + 4) = √20 = 2√5를 구합니다.

1. **직선의 기울기 확인**:
   주어진 직선 \(y = 2x - 2\)의 기울기는 \(2\)입니다.

2. **수직선의 기울기 구하기**:
   주어진 점 \((6, 0)\)을 통과하는 수직선의 기울기는 원래 직선의 기울기의 음의 역수입니다. 즉, 수직선의 기울기는 \(-\frac{1}{2}\)입니다.

3. **수직선의 방정식 구하기**:
   점 \((6, 0)\)을 통과하며 기울기가 \(-\frac{1}{2}\)인 수직선의 방정식은:
   \[
   y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
   \]

4. **두 직선의 교점 구하기**:
   주어진 직선 \(y = 2x - 2\)와 수직선 \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3\)의 교점을 구합니다:
   \[
   2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3

   \[
   2x + \frac{1}{2}x = 3 + 2

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the four distinct roots of the equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). The set is unordered, so I just need to find all possible values of these expressions and present them as a set.

First, I remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a quartic equation, I can use Vieta's formulas to find expressions involving the roots without having to find the roots themselves, which is good because solving a quartic can be complicated.

The given polynomial is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let me write it in the standard form:

\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\).

So, comparing this to the general quartic equation \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = 0\)
- \(c = 0\)
- \(d = 2\)

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\):

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d = 2\)

So, from Vieta, we have:

- Sum of roots: \(-2\)
- Sum of products two at a time: \(0\)
- Sum of products three at a time: \(0\)
- Product of all roots: \(2\)

Now, the problem is asking for the set of expressions \(\alpha_i\alpha_j + \alpha_k\alpha_l\) where each expression is a sum of two products of roots, and each product is of two distinct roots. Since the set is unordered, I just need to find all possible such sums and collect them.

But wait, how many such expressions are there? For four roots, the number of ways to pair them into two pairs is 3. Specifically, the three pairings are:

1. \((\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)\)
2. \((\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\)
3. \((\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

So, these are the three elements of the set we need to find.

I need to find the values of these three expressions. Let me denote them as:

\(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)

\(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\)

\(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\)

So, the set is \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\).

I need to find the values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Since the polynomial is symmetric in its roots, these sums might be related in some way, perhaps they are roots of another polynomial.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between these sums using Vieta's formulas.

Let me think. I know that the sum of all products two at a time is zero:

\(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)

So, if I denote \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), then the sum of the other two products is \(S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Wait, but that's actually equal to the sum of all products two at a time minus \(S_1\). So:

\(S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) = (\text{sum of all products two at a time}) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0 - S_1 = -S_1\)

So, \(S_2 + S_3 = -S_1\)

Similarly, if I consider \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\), that would be equal to the sum of all products two at a time, which is zero. So:

\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\)

So, that gives me one equation.

Now, I need more information to find the individual values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Perhaps I can find the sum of their squares or the product of these sums.

Let me compute \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\). Expanding each square:

\(S_1^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2\)

Similarly,

\(S_2^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2\)

\(S_3^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\)

Adding them together:

\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2) + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3\)

Simplify the terms:

First, the squared terms:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\)

This can be written as:

\((\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2)\)

Which is equal to:

\(\alpha_1^2(\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2) + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2\)

But this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, I can note that the sum \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\) can be expressed in terms of the squares of the products of roots.

Wait, another approach: Let me consider the square of the sum of all products two at a time.

We know that \((\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 0^2 = 0\)

Expanding this, we get:

\(\sum (\alpha_i\alpha_j)^2 + 2\sum (\alpha_i\alpha_j)(\alpha_k\alpha_l)\) where \(i < j\), \(k < l\), and \((i,j) \neq (k,l)\)

But this seems messy, but maybe we can relate it to \(S_1, S_2, S_3\).

Wait, actually, the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), as we saw earlier.

Also, the sum \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\) can be related to the squares of the products of roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products \(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3\). Let me compute that.

Compute \(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3\):

First, \(S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\)

Expanding this:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)

Similarly, \(S_1 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

Expanding:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)

And \(S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

Expanding:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)

Now, adding all these together:

\(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = [\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2] + [\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4] + [\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4]\)

Let me collect like terms:

- Terms with \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\): 1 term
- Terms with \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4\): 1 term
- Terms with \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\): 1 term
- Similarly, terms with \(\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\): 1 term

First, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals, so it's equidistant from all four vertices. The ratio AB/AD is given as k, which means if I let AD be of length 'a', then AB would be 'ka'. So, the rectangle has sides of length 'a' and 'ka'.

Now, the problem is about choosing a random point inside this rectangle and determining the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four corners. So, essentially, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point in this region is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D.

Let me denote the coordinates to make this more concrete. Let's place the rectangle in a coordinate system with O at the origin (0,0). Since O is the center, the coordinates of the vertices can be defined as follows:

- A: (-ka/2, a/2)
- B: (ka/2, a/2)
- C: (ka/2, -a/2)
- D: (-ka/2, -a/2)

Wait, hold on, actually, if AB is the length ka and AD is a, then the coordinates should be:

- A: (-ka/2, a/2)
- B: (ka/2, a/2)
- C: (ka/2, -a/2)
- D: (-ka/2, -a/2)

Yes, that makes sense because the length AB is ka, so the distance from A to B along the x-axis is ka, and the length AD is a, so the distance from A to D along the y-axis is a.

Now, the center O is at (0,0). So, any point (x,y) inside the rectangle must satisfy -ka/2 ≤ x ≤ ka/2 and -a/2 ≤ y ≤ a/2.

I need to find the set of all points (x,y) such that the distance from (x,y) to O is less than the distance from (x,y) to each of A, B, C, D.

Mathematically, this means:

√(x² + y²) < √[(x + ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²] (distance to A)
√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²] (distance to B)
√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²] (distance to C)
√(x² + y²) < √[(x + ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²] (distance to D)

Since square roots are involved, I can square both sides to eliminate them, which should simplify the inequalities.

Starting with the distance to A:

x² + y² < (x + ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²

Expanding the right side:

(x + ka/2)² = x² + ka x + (ka/2)²
(y - a/2)² = y² - a y + (a/2)²

So, adding them together:

x² + ka x + (ka/2)² + y² - a y + (a/2)²

Subtracting x² + y² from both sides:

0 < ka x + (ka/2)² - a y + (a/2)²

Simplify:

ka x - a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0

Factor out 'a' from the first two terms:

a(k x - y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Divide both sides by 'a' (assuming a ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's a rectangle):

k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check my steps again.

Wait, when I subtract x² + y² from both sides, I get:

0 < ka x + (ka/2)² - a y + (a/2)²

Which is:

0 < ka x - a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4)

Factor out 'a' from the first two terms:

0 < a(k x - y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4)

Divide both sides by 'a' (positive, so inequality remains same):

0 < k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4)

So, the inequality becomes:

k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Similarly, I can do the same for the distance to B:

√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²]

Squaring both sides:

x² + y² < (x - ka/2)² + (y - a/2)²

Expanding the right side:

(x - ka/2)² = x² - ka x + (ka/2)²
(y - a/2)² = y² - a y + (a/2)²

Adding them:

x² - ka x + (ka/2)² + y² - a y + (a/2)²

Subtract x² + y²:

0 < -ka x + (ka/2)² - a y + (a/2)²

Simplify:

-ka x - a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0

Factor out '-a' from the first two terms:

- a(k x + y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Divide by 'a':

- (k x + y) + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Which is:

- k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Similarly, for distance to C:

√(x² + y²) < √[(x - ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²]

Squaring:

x² + y² < (x - ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²

Expanding:

x² - ka x + (ka/2)² + y² + a y + (a/2)²

Subtract x² + y²:

0 < -ka x + (ka/2)² + a y + (a/2)²

Simplify:

-ka x + a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0

Factor:

- a(k x - y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Divide by 'a':

- (k x - y) + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Which is:

- k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

And finally, for distance to D:

√(x² + y²) < √[(x + ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²]

Squaring:

x² + y² < (x + ka/2)² + (y + a/2)²

Expanding:

x² + ka x + (ka/2)² + y² + a y + (a/2)²

Subtract x² + y²:

0 < ka x + (ka/2)² + a y + (a/2)²

Simplify:

ka x + a y + (k² a² /4 + a² /4) > 0

Factor:

a(k x + y) + (a² (k² + 1)/4) > 0

Divide by 'a':

k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

So, now I have four inequalities:

1. k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0
2. -k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0
3. -k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0
4. k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0

These four inequalities define the region where a point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. So, the intersection of these four regions will give me the desired area.

Let me try to visualize these inequalities. Each inequality represents a half-plane. The intersection of all four will form a polygon, likely a quadrilateral or another shape, within the rectangle.

Let me rewrite the inequalities for clarity:

1. y < k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)
2. y < -k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)
3. y > k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)
4. y > -k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)

Wait, hold on, let me check that. When I rearrange the inequalities:

1. From the first inequality: k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y < k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)
2. From the second inequality: -k x - y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y < -k x + (a (k² + 1)/4)
3. From the third inequality: -k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y > k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)
4. From the fourth inequality: k x + y + (a (k² + 1)/4) > 0 => y > -k x - (a (k² + 1)/4)

Yes, that's correct. So, the region is bounded by four lines:

- y = k x + c
- y = -k x + c
- y = k x - c
- y = -k x - c

Where c = (a (k² + 1)/4)

So, these four lines form a diamond (a rotated square) centered at the origin. The intersection of these four lines will create a diamond shape inside the rectangle.

To find the area where all four inequalities are satisfied, I need to find the region bounded by these four lines. The intersection points of these lines will give the vertices of this diamond.

Let me find the intersection points.

First, find where y = k x + c intersects y = -k x + c.

Set k x + c = -k x + c => 2k x = 0 => x = 0. Then y = c. So, one point is (0, c).

Similarly, find where y = -k x + c intersects y = -k x - c.

Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me pair them correctly.

Wait, actually, each pair of lines will intersect at a point. Let me list all possible intersections:

1. Intersection of y = k x + c and y = -k x + c: as above, (0, c)
2. Intersection of y = -k x + c and y = -k x - c: Wait, these are parallel lines? No, wait, no, they have the same slope but different intercepts, so they don't intersect.
Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, y = -k x + c and y = -k x - c are parallel, so they don't intersect. Similarly, y = k x + c and y = k x - c are parallel.

Wait, so actually, the four lines form two pairs of parallel lines, each pair with slopes k and -k. So, the four lines form a parallelogram, not a diamond. Hmm, but since the slopes are negative reciprocals? Wait, no, the slopes are k and -k, which are not negative reciprocals unless k=1.

Wait, actually, for a diamond shape, the lines should have slopes that are negative reciprocals, but in this case, they are just k and -k, so unless k=1, it's not a diamond but a parallelogram.

Wait, but in our case, the four lines are:

1. y = k x + c
2. y = -k x + c
3. y = k x - c
4. y = -k x - c

So, these four lines form a parallelogram. Let me find the four intersection points.

Intersection of y = k x + c and y = -k x + c: as before, (0, c)

Intersection of y = -k x + c and y = k x - c:

Set -k x + c = k x - c => -2k x = -2c => x = c/k

Then y = -k*(c/k) + c = -c + c = 0. So, point is (c/k, 0)

Similarly, intersection of y = k x - c and y = -k x - c:

Set k x - c = -k x - c => 2k x = 0 => x=0, y = -c. So, point is (0, -c)

Intersection of y = -k x - c and y = k x + c:

Set -k x - c = k x + c => -2k x = 2c => x = -c/k

Then y = -k*(-c/k) - c = c - c = 0. So, point is (-c/k, 0)

So, the four vertices of the parallelogram are:

(0, c), (c/k, 0), (0, -c), (-c/k, 0)

So, this is a diamond (a rhombus) centered at the origin, with vertices along the y-axis at (0, c) and (0, -c), and along the x-axis at (c/k, 0) and (-c/k, 0).

Wait, but in our rectangle, the x-axis goes from -ka/2 to ka/2, and the y-axis from -a/2 to a/2.

So, the diamond is inscribed within the rectangle. Now, I","[0, '0).\n']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False

"Okay, so I have this function f(n) defined piecewise. Let me make sure I understand it correctly. The function f(n) is equal to the floor of n if n is greater than or equal to 4, and it's equal to the ceiling of n if n is less than 4. So, depending on whether the input is 4 or more or less than 4, it either takes the floor or the ceiling of that number.

Alright, the problem is asking me to compute f(π/3) + f(√45) + f(8^(2/3)). So, I need to evaluate each of these three terms separately and then add them up.

Let me start with the first term: f(π/3). Since π is approximately 3.1416, dividing that by 3 gives me roughly 1.0472. So, π/3 is approximately 1.0472. Now, since 1.0472 is less than 4, according to the function definition, I need to take the ceiling of this value. The ceiling function rounds a number up to the nearest integer. So, the ceiling of 1.0472 is 2. Therefore, f(π/3) is 2.

Next, the second term is f(√45). Let me calculate √45. I know that 6 squared is 36 and 7 squared is 49, so √45 is somewhere between 6 and 7. To get a more precise value, I can note that 45 is 9*5, so √45 is 3√5. Since √5 is approximately 2.236, multiplying that by 3 gives me about 6.708. So, √45 is approximately 6.708. Now, since 6.708 is greater than or equal to 4, I need to take the floor of this value. The floor function rounds a number down to the nearest integer. So, the floor of 6.708 is 6. Therefore, f(√45) is 6.

Moving on to the third term: f(8^(2/3)). Let me compute 8^(2/3). I know that 8 is 2^3, so 8^(1/3) is 2. Then, raising that result to the power of 2 gives me 2^2, which is 4. So, 8^(2/3) is exactly 4. Now, since 4 is equal to 4, according to the function definition, I need to take the floor of this value. The floor of 4 is just 4. Therefore, f(8^(2/3)) is 4.

Now, adding all three results together: f(π/3) is 2, f(√45) is 6, and f(8^(2/3)) is 4. So, 2 + 6 + 4 equals 12.

Wait, let me double-check each step to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For f(π/3), π is about 3.1416, so divided by 3 is approximately 1.0472. Since that's less than 4, ceiling of 1.0472 is indeed 2. Correct.

For f(√45), √45 is approximately 6.708, which is more than 4, so floor of that is 6. That seems right.

For f(8^(2/3)), 8^(1/3) is 2, squared is 4. Since 4 is equal to 4, floor of 4 is 4. That's correct.

Adding them up: 2 + 6 is 8, plus 4 is 12. So, the total is 12.

I think that's all correct. I don't see any errors in my calculations or reasoning.
</think>

The function \( f(n) \) is evaluated for each term as follows:

1. \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \): Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 < 4 \), we take the ceiling, which is 2.
2. \( f(\sqrt{45}) \): Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \geq 4 \), we take the floor, which is 6.
3. \( f(8^{2/3}) \): Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we take the floor, which is 4.

Adding these results: \( 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \).

"Okay, so I have this magic square problem here. A magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same. The grid given is a 3x3 magic square, and some of the cells are filled with expressions involving 'n'. My job is to figure out what 'n' is.

First, let me try to visualize the magic square based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like the grid is labeled with some expressions and numbers. Let me write down the grid as per the labels:

Looking at the Asymptote code, the labels are placed at specific coordinates. Each label is placed at the center of each cell, so the first row (from top to bottom) would be:

- First cell: n - 3
- Second cell: 3
- Third cell: n + 1

Wait, no, hold on. The Asymptote code labels are placed at (0.5, 0.5), which is the center of the first cell, (0.5, 1.5) is the center of the second cell in the first column, and so on. So actually, the grid is structured as follows:

First row (top row):
- First cell: n - 3
- Second cell: 3
- Third cell: n + 1

Second row:
- First cell: n + 2
- Second cell: 2n - 9
- Third cell: 1

Third row:
- First cell: 2
- Second cell: n
- Third cell: n - 1

Wait, let me make sure. The Asymptote code labels are placed at (x, y) where x and y are the coordinates. The first label is at (0.5, 0.5), which is the center of the first cell in the first row, first column. Then (0.5, 1.5) is the center of the first column, second row. Similarly, (0.5, 2.5) is the first column, third row. So actually, the grid is:

First column:
- Top: n - 3
- Middle: n + 2
- Bottom: 2

Second column:
- Top: 3
- Middle: 2n - 9
- Bottom: n

Third column:
- Top: n + 1
- Middle: 1
- Bottom: n - 1

So the grid is:

Row 1: [n - 3, 3, n + 1]

Row 2: [n + 2, 2n - 9, 1]

Row 3: [2, n, n - 1]

Okay, that makes more sense. So now, I can write the grid as:

| n-3 | 3 | n+1 |
|-----|---|-----|
| n+2 |2n-9| 1 |
| 2 | n | n-1 |

Now, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals must add up to the same number, which is called the magic constant.

Let me denote the magic constant as S. So, each row, column, and diagonal sums to S.

First, let's write down the equations based on the rows.

Row 1: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S

Simplify that: n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 = S

Row 2: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S

Simplify: n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 = S

Row 3: 2 + n + (n - 1) = S

Simplify: 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 = S

Wait, so from Row 1 and Row 3, both give S = 2n + 1. From Row 2, S = 3n - 6.

So, since both expressions equal S, we can set them equal to each other:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6

Solving for n:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6

Subtract 2n from both sides:

1 = n - 6

Add 6 to both sides:

n = 7

Hmm, so n is 7? Let me check if this makes sense.

Let me substitute n = 7 into the grid:

Row 1: 7 - 3 = 4, 3, 7 + 1 = 8. So Row 1: 4, 3, 8. Sum: 4 + 3 + 8 = 15.

Row 2: 7 + 2 = 9, 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, 1. So Row 2: 9, 5, 1. Sum: 9 + 5 + 1 = 15.

Row 3: 2, 7, 7 - 1 = 6. So Row 3: 2, 7, 6. Sum: 2 + 7 + 6 = 15.

Okay, so all rows sum to 15. Good.

Now, let's check the columns.

Column 1: 4, 9, 2. Sum: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15.

Column 2: 3, 5, 7. Sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

Column 3: 8, 1, 6. Sum: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15.

Perfect, all columns also sum to 15.

Now, the diagonals.

Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): 4, 5, 6. Sum: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): 8, 5, 2. Sum: 8 + 5 + 2 = 15.

Everything checks out. So n = 7 is correct.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial equations.

From Row 1: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1.

Yes, because n - 3 + 3 cancels out to n, and then + n +1 is 2n +1.

Row 2: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n -9 +1 = 3n -6.

Yes, that's correct.

Row 3: 2 + n + (n -1) = 2 + n + n -1 = 2n +1.

So, 2n +1 = 3n -6, leading to n=7.

Yes, that seems solid.

Just to be thorough, let me plug n=7 into all cells:

Row 1: 4, 3, 8

Row 2: 9, 5, 1

Row 3: 2, 7, 6

This is actually a well-known magic square, the Lo Shu square, which is the 3x3 magic square with magic constant 15. So, that's a good sign.

Therefore, n is 7.
</think>

The value of \( n \) is determined by ensuring all rows, columns, and diagonals of the magic square sum to the same constant. By setting up equations from the rows and solving, we find \( n = 7 \).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find all possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number satisfying \(\omega^3 = 1\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the equation \(\omega^3 = 1\) has three roots, which are the cube roots of unity. These roots are 1, \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\). But since \(\omega\) is a complex number, it can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined or something? Wait, no, actually, if \(\omega = 1\), then \(1 + \omega = 2\) and \(1 + \omega^2 = 2\), so the expression would be \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\). But maybe the problem is considering the non-real cube roots? I'm not sure. Let me check.

So, the cube roots of unity are 1, \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are complex numbers. Since the problem says \(\omega\) is a complex number, it's probably referring to the non-real roots. So, \(\omega\) is either \(\omega\) or \(\omega^2\). But wait, \(\omega^2\) is also a complex number, so maybe both are acceptable. So, I need to compute the expression for both \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) and see if they give the same value or different ones.

Alternatively, maybe the expression is the same regardless of whether \(\omega\) is \(\omega\) or \(\omega^2\). Let me try to compute it.

First, let me recall that for cube roots of unity, we have the property that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). That might be useful here. Also, \(\omega^3 = 1\), so \(\omega^3 - 1 = 0\), which factors as \((\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0\). So, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) for the non-real roots.

Okay, so maybe I can use that identity to simplify the expression.

Let me write down the expression again:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

I can try to combine these two fractions by finding a common denominator. The common denominator would be \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). So, let's compute the numerator:

\[
(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega) = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

But from the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). So, substituting that into the numerator:

\[
2 + (-1) = 1
\]

So, the numerator is 1. Now, let's compute the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)
\]

Let me expand this:

\[
1 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot \omega^2 + \omega \cdot 1 + \omega \cdot \omega^2
\]

Simplify each term:

- \(1 \cdot 1 = 1\)
- \(1 \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^2\)
- \(\omega \cdot 1 = \omega\)
- \(\omega \cdot \omega^2 = \omega^3\)

But \(\omega^3 = 1\), so that term is 1. So, putting it all together:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = (1 + 1) + (\omega + \omega^2) = 2 + (-1) = 1
\]

So, the denominator is also 1. Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

Wait, so the expression equals 1? But earlier, I thought if \(\omega = 1\), the expression would be 1 as well. But if \(\omega = 1\), then \(1 + \omega = 2\) and \(1 + \omega^2 = 2\), so the expression is \(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1\). So, whether \(\omega\) is 1 or a non-real cube root, the expression is 1. But wait, if \(\omega = 1\), then \(\omega^2 = 1\) as well, so both denominators are 2, and the sum is 1. If \(\omega\) is a non-real cube root, then the expression is also 1. So, in all cases, the expression equals 1.

But wait, the problem says ""복소수 \(\omega\)"" which is a complex number, so maybe it's considering all cube roots, including 1. But in that case, the expression is always 1. So, the only possible value is 1.

Wait, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation. Let me compute the expression for \(\omega = e^{2\pi i /3}\), which is a primitive cube root of unity.

So, \(\omega = e^{2\pi i /3} = \cos(2\pi/3) + i \sin(2\pi/3) = -1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2\). Then, \(\omega^2 = e^{4\pi i /3} = \cos(4\pi/3) + i \sin(4\pi/3) = -1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2\).

Compute \(1 + \omega = 1 + (-1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2\). Similarly, \(1 + \omega^2 = 1 + (-1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2\).

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2} + \frac{1}{1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2}
\]

Let me compute each term separately. The first term:

\[
\frac{1}{1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2} = \frac{1}{e^{i\pi/3}} = e^{-i\pi/3} = \cos(-\pi/3) + i \sin(-\pi/3) = 1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2
\]

Similarly, the second term:

\[
\frac{1}{1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2} = \frac{1}{e^{-i\pi/3}} = e^{i\pi/3} = \cos(\pi/3) + i \sin(\pi/3) = 1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2
\]

Adding these two together:

\[
(1/2 - i \sqrt{3}/2) + (1/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i \sqrt{3}/2 + i \sqrt{3}/2) = 1 + 0 = 1
\]

So, yes, it does equal 1. Therefore, regardless of whether \(\omega\) is 1 or a non-real cube root, the expression equals 1. So, the only possible value is 1.

Wait, but if \(\omega = 1\), then \(\omega^2 = 1\) as well, so both denominators are 2, and the sum is 1. If \(\omega\) is a non-real cube root, the sum is also 1. So, in all cases, the expression is 1. Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

I think that's it. So, the answer is 1.
</think>

The expression simplifies to 1 regardless of whether \(\omega\) is 1 or a non-real cube root of unity. Therefore, the only possible value is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where there are four points: A, B, C, and D. I need to find the shortest possible distance when starting from any one of these points and visiting the other three exactly once. Hmm, that sounds like a traveling salesman problem but with four points. I remember that the traveling salesman problem is about finding the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city, but in this case, I don't need to return to the starting point, just visit all four points once. So, it's a bit different.

First, I should probably figure out the distances between each pair of points. The Asymptote code gives me some distances, so I can use those. Let me list them out:

- D to B is 3 units.
- A to B is 6 units.
- A to C is 6 units.
- D to C is 4 units.
- A to D is 5 units.
- C to B is 5 units.

Wait, so let me make sure I have all the distances correctly. From the Asymptote code, the labels are:

- ""3"" between D and B,
- ""6"" between A and B,
- ""6"" between A and C,
- ""4"" between D and C,
- ""5"" between A and D,
- ""5"" between C and B.

So, I can represent this as a graph where each node is a point, and the edges have the given weights. Let me write down all the distances:

- AB = 6
- AC = 6
- AD = 5
- BC = 5
- BD = 3
- CD = 4

So, now I need to find the shortest path that starts at one point and visits the other three exactly once. Since it's four points, the number of possible paths is 4! = 24, but since we can start at any point, maybe it's a bit less? Wait, no, actually, for each starting point, there are 3! = 6 permutations of the remaining points. So, 4 starting points × 6 permutations each = 24 total paths. But that's a lot to check manually. Maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, maybe I can list all possible paths and calculate their total distances, then pick the smallest one. Let's try that.

First, let's list all possible starting points and their permutations.

Starting at A:

1. A -> B -> C -> D
2. A -> B -> D -> C
3. A -> C -> B -> D
4. A -> C -> D -> B
5. A -> D -> B -> C
6. A -> D -> C -> B

Starting at B:

7. B -> A -> C -> D
8. B -> A -> D -> C
9. B -> C -> A -> D
10. B -> C -> D -> A
11. B -> D -> A -> C
12. B -> D -> C -> A

Starting at C:

13. C -> A -> B -> D
14. C -> A -> D -> B
15. C -> B -> A -> D
16. C -> B -> D -> A
17. C -> D -> A -> B
18. C -> D -> B -> A

Starting at D:

19. D -> A -> B -> C
20. D -> A -> C -> B
21. D -> B -> A -> C
22. D -> B -> C -> A
23. D -> C -> A -> B
24. D -> C -> B -> A

Now, for each of these 24 paths, I need to calculate the total distance. Let's go one by one.

Starting with A:

1. A -> B -> C -> D
   - A to B: 6
   - B to C: 5
   - C to D: 4
   Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

2. A -> B -> D -> C
   - A to B: 6
   - B to D: 3
   - D to C: 4
   Total: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13

3. A -> C -> B -> D
   - A to C: 6
   - C to B: 5
   - B to D: 3
   Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

4. A -> C -> D -> B
   - A to C: 6
   - C to D: 4
   - D to B: 3
   Total: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13

5. A -> D -> B -> C
   - A to D: 5
   - D to B: 3
   - B to C: 5
   Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

6. A -> D -> C -> B
   - A to D: 5
   - D to C: 4
   - C to B: 5
   Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

So, starting at A, the shortest path is 13, achieved by paths 2, 4, and 5.

Now, starting at B:

7. B -> A -> C -> D
   - B to A: 6
   - A to C: 6
   - C to D: 4
   Total: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16

8. B -> A -> D -> C
   - B to A: 6
   - A to D: 5
   - D to C: 4
   Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

9. B -> C -> A -> D
   - B to C: 5
   - C to A: 6
   - A to D: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

10. B -> C -> D -> A
    - B to C: 5
    - C to D: 4
    - D to A: 5
    Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

11. B -> D -> A -> C
    - B to D: 3
    - D to A: 5
    - A to C: 6
    Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

12. B -> D -> C -> A
    - B to D: 3
    - D to C: 4
    - C to A: 6
    Total: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

So, starting at B, the shortest path is 13, achieved by path 12.

Moving on to starting at C:

13. C -> A -> B -> D
    - C to A: 6
    - A to B: 6
    - B to D: 3
    Total: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15

14. C -> A -> D -> B
    - C to A: 6
    - A to D: 5
    - D to B: 3
    Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

15. C -> B -> A -> D
    - C to B: 5
    - B to A: 6
    - A to D: 5
    Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

16. C -> B -> D -> A
    - C to B: 5
    - B to D: 3
    - D to A: 5
    Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

17. C -> D -> A -> B
    - C to D: 4
    - D to A: 5
    - A to B: 6
    Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

18. C -> D -> B -> A
    - C to D: 4
    - D to B: 3
    - B to A: 6
    Total: 4 + 3 + 6 = 13

So, starting at C, the shortest paths are 13, achieved by paths 16, 18.

Finally, starting at D:

19. D -> A -> B -> C
    - D to A: 5
    - A to B: 6
    - B to C: 5
    Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

20. D -> A -> C -> B
    - D to A: 5
    - A to C: 6
    - C to B: 5
    Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

21. D -> B -> A -> C
    - D to B: 3
    - B to A: 6
    - A to C: 6
    Total: 3 + 6 + 6 = 15

22. D -> B -> C -> A
    - D to B: 3
    - B to C: 5
    - C to A: 6
    Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

23. D -> C -> A -> B
    - D to C: 4
    - C to A: 6
    - A to B: 6
    Total: 4 + 6 + 6 = 16

24. D -> C -> B -> A
    - D to C: 4
    - C to B: 5
    - B to A: 6
    Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

So, starting at D, the shortest path is 14, achieved by path 22.

Now, compiling all the shortest paths from each starting point:

- Starting at A: 13
- Starting at B: 13
- Starting at C: 13
- Starting at D: 14

So, the overall shortest path is 13 units. But wait, let me double-check if I didn't make any calculation errors.

Looking back at the paths that gave 13:

From A: paths 2 (A-B-D-C), 4 (A-C-D-B), 5 (A-D-B-C)
From B: path 12 (B-D-C-A)
From C: paths 16 (C-B-D-A), 18 (C-D-B-A)
From D: none, the shortest was 14.

So, all these paths have a total distance of 13. Therefore, the minimal distance is 13.

Wait, but let me make sure that I didn't miss any possible shorter path. For example, is there a way to have a path that goes through D multiple times? No, because we have to visit each point exactly once. So, each point is visited once, so the path is a permutation of the four points, starting at one and visiting the others in some order.

Therefore, the minimal total distance is 13.

I think that's correct. So, the answer should be 13.
</think>

The shortest distance is achieved by several paths, each totaling 13 units. Therefore, the minimal distance is \boxed{13}.","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
