"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a right triangle, and I need to find the length of side DE. The diagram shows a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E. They told me that sin D is 0.7, and one of the sides, EF, is 7 units long. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what sine means in a right triangle. Sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, and the sides are DE, EF, and DF. Since it's a right triangle at E, DF must be the hypotenuse.

So, sin D = opposite side / hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle D would be EF, which is given as 7. The hypotenuse is DF. So, sin D = EF / DF = 0.7. That means 7 / DF = 0.7. I can solve for DF here.

Let me write that down:

sin D = EF / DF  
0.7 = 7 / DF  
So, DF = 7 / 0.7  
Calculating that, 7 divided by 0.7 is 10. So, DF is 10 units long.

Now, I need to find DE. Since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, DF² = DE² + EF².

We know DF is 10 and EF is 7, so plugging those in:

10² = DE² + 7²  
100 = DE² + 49  
Subtracting 49 from both sides:  
DE² = 100 - 49  
DE² = 51  
Taking the square root of both sides:  
DE = sqrt(51)

Wait, sqrt(51) is approximately 7.141, but since they didn't specify rounding, I should leave it as sqrt(51). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Identified angle D, opposite side EF = 7, hypotenuse DF.
2. sin D = 0.7 = 7 / DF => DF = 10. That seems right.
3. Applied Pythagorean theorem: 10² = DE² + 7² => 100 = DE² + 49 => DE² = 51 => DE = sqrt(51). Yep, that looks correct.

Alternatively, I could have used cosine instead. Since sin D = 0.7, then cos D would be sqrt(1 - sin² D) = sqrt(1 - 0.49) = sqrt(0.51). But wait, sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.714, which is the same as sqrt(51)/10 because sqrt(51) is about 7.141, and 7.141/10 is 0.714. So, cos D = DE / DF, which would be DE / 10 = sqrt(51)/10, so DE = sqrt(51). That confirms my earlier result.

I think that's solid. So, DE is sqrt(51). I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( DE \) is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of side EF is 7 units. We need to find the length of side DE.

1. Recall that \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, the opposite side to angle D is EF, and the hypotenuse is DF.
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
   \]
   Solving for DF:
   \[
   DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

2. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find DE:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
   \]
   \[
   100 = DE^2 + 49
   \]
   Solving for \(DE^2\):
   \[
   DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
   \]
   Taking the square root:
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{51}
   \]

Thus, the value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians in the anti-clockwise direction. Hmm, complex number rotations... I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves translating the system so that the point becomes the origin, performing the rotation, and then translating back. Let me try to recall the exact steps.

First, I think I need to express both \( z \) and \( c \) as complex numbers. \( z \) is already given as \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), which I can write as \( z = (2 + \sqrt{2}) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \). Similarly, \( c \) is \( 2 - 3i \).

To rotate \( z \) around \( c \), I should translate the complex plane so that \( c \) becomes the origin. That means I subtract \( c \) from \( z \). So, let me compute \( z - c \):

\( z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + (- (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3))i \)

Simplifying the real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

Simplifying the imaginary part: \( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) + 3 = -3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3 = -3\sqrt{2} \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check:

Real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \) ✔️

Imaginary part: \( -3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3 = -3\sqrt{2} \) ✔️

Okay, so now I have the translated point \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Now, I need to rotate this point by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians anti-clockwise. I remember that rotation in the complex plane can be done by multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the angle of rotation.

So, the rotation factor is \( e^{i\pi/4} \). Let me compute that. \( e^{i\pi/4} = \cos(\pi/4) + i\sin(\pi/4) \). Since \( \cos(\pi/4) = \sin(\pi/4) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), this becomes \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

So, to rotate \( z - c \), I need to multiply it by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Let me write that out:

\( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Let me compute this multiplication step by step. First, multiply \( \sqrt{2} \) by each term in the second complex number:

\( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

\( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Next, multiply \( -3\sqrt{2}i \) by each term in the second complex number:

\( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

\( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i^2 = -3i^2 \)

Wait, \( i^2 = -1 \), so that term becomes \( -3(-1) = 3 \).

Now, let me add all these results together:

1 (from the first multiplication) + i (from the second) - 3i (from the third) + 3 (from the fourth).

So, combining like terms:

Real parts: 1 + 3 = 4

Imaginary parts: i - 3i = -2i

So, the result of the multiplication is \( 4 - 2i \).

Wait, let me verify that again because I might have made a mistake in the signs.

First term: \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \) ✔️

Second term: \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \) ✔️

Third term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i \) ✔️

Fourth term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i^2 = 3 \) ✔️

Adding them up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i ✔️

Okay, so after rotation, the translated point becomes \( 4 - 2i \). Now, I need to translate back by adding \( c \) to this result. So, \( w = (4 - 2i) + c \).

Given that \( c = 2 - 3i \), let's compute:

\( w = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i \)

Wait, hold on. Let me write it step by step:

\( w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) \)

Adding real parts: 4 + 2 = 6

Adding imaginary parts: -2i - 3i = -5i

So, \( w = 6 - 5i \). Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Wait, when I translated back, I added \( c \) to the rotated translated point. So, yes, \( (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i \). That seems correct.

But let me think again: the rotation was done on \( z - c \), which gave me \( 4 - 2i \), and then adding \( c \) gives me \( w \). So, yes, 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i.

Wait, but let me check if I did the rotation correctly. Maybe I should represent \( z - c \) as a complex number and perform the rotation using the formula.

Alternatively, another way to think about rotation is using the formula:

If you have a point \( z \) and you want to rotate it around point \( c \) by angle \( \theta \), the formula is:

\( w = c + (z - c) \times e^{i\theta} \)

Which is exactly what I did. So, \( w = c + (z - c) \times e^{i\pi/4} \). So, that's correct.

Wait, but let me compute \( (z - c) \times e^{i\pi/4} \) again to make sure.

\( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)

\( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Multiplying them:

\( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \)

Let me compute each term:

First, multiply \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Then, \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Next, \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

Then, \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i^2 = -3(-1) = 3 \)

Adding all together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. So, same result as before. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, adding back \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \). So, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially with rotations, it's easy to make a mistake with the direction or the multiplication.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent \( z - c \) in polar form and then add the angle \( \pi/4 \) to its argument.

Let me try that approach.

First, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Let me compute its magnitude and argument.

Magnitude: \( |z - c| = \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 9 \times 2} = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \)

Argument: \( \theta = \arctan\left( \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \arctan(-3) \). Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, the point is in the fourth quadrant. So, the argument is \( -\arctan(3) \).

So, in polar form, \( z - c = 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(-\arctan(3)) + i \sin(-\arctan(3)) \right) \)

When we rotate this by \( \pi/4 \), the new argument becomes \( -\arctan(3) + \pi/4 \).

So, the new complex number after rotation is:

\( 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) + i \sin(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) \right) \)

Hmm, this seems more complicated, but let me compute it.

First, let me compute \( \cos(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) \) and \( \sin(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) \).

Using the angle addition formulas:

\( \cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B \)

\( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B \)

Let me set \( A = -\arctan(3) \) and \( B = \pi/4 \).

First, compute \( \cos(-\arctan(3)) \) and \( \sin(-\arctan(3)) \).

Since \( \arctan(3) \) is an angle whose tangent is 3, so in a right triangle, the opposite side is 3, adjacent is 1, hypotenuse is \( \sqrt{1 + 9} = \sqrt{10} \).

Therefore,

\( \cos(\arctan(3)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \)

\( \sin(\arctan(3)) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \)

But since \( A = -\arctan(3) \), we have:

\( \cos(-\arctan(3)) = \cos(\arctan(3)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \)

\( \sin(-\arctan(3)) = -\sin(\arctan(3)) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \)

Now, compute \( \cos(A + B) \):

\( \cos(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) = \cos(-\arctan(3)) \cos(\pi/4) - \sin(-\arctan(3)) \sin(\pi/4) \)

Plugging in the values:

\( \frac{1}{\sqrt{10}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \left( -\frac{3}{\sqrt{10}} \right) \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{10}} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{10}} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{10}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{10}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{10}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{20}}{10} = \frac{2 \times 2\sqrt{5}}{10} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{5}}{5} \)

Similarly, compute \( \sin(A + B) \):

\( \sin(-\arctan(3) + \pi/4) = \sin(-\arctan(3)) \cos(\pi/4) + \cos(-\arctan(3)) \sin(\pi/4) \)

"To simplify the square root of 242, I start by factoring 242 into its prime components. I recognize that 242 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 242 by 2 gives me 121.

"Okay, so I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when expanding expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\). So, in this case, \(a\) is \(10x^3\) and \(b\) is \(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\), right?

Alright, so the expansion will have terms from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 5\). Each term will look like \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\). My goal is to find the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, I need to figure out for which value of \(k\) the exponent of \(x\) in the term becomes zero.

Let me write out the general term more clearly. The term is:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times (10x^3)^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying each part:

First, \(\binom{5}{k}\) is just the binomial coefficient, which I can calculate once I know \(k\).

Next, \((10x^3)^{5 - k}\) can be broken down into \(10^{5 - k} \times x^{3(5 - k)}\).

Similarly, \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\) can be written as \((-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{-2k}\).

Putting it all together, the term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times (-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{3(5 - k) - 2k}
\]

Simplifying the exponent of \(x\):

\(3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k\).

So, the exponent of \(x\) is \(15 - 5k\). I need this exponent to be zero for the term to be constant. Therefore, I set up the equation:

\(15 - 5k = 0\)

Solving for \(k\):

\(15 = 5k\)

\(k = 3\)

Okay, so the constant term occurs when \(k = 3\). Now, I need to compute the term when \(k = 3\).

Let me compute each part step by step.

First, the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{3}\). I know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = 10\).

Next, \(10^{5 - 3} = 10^2 = 100\).

Then, \((-1)^3 = -1\).

\(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\).

Multiplying all these together:

\[
10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

Let me compute this step by step:

First, \(10 \times 100 = 1000\).

Then, \(1000 \times (-1) = -1000\).

Next, \(-1000 \times \frac{1}{8} = -125\).

So, the constant term is \(-125\).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting with the binomial coefficient: \(\binom{5}{3}\) is indeed 10.

\(10^{5 - 3}\) is \(10^2 = 100\), correct.

\((-1)^3 = -1\), that's right.

\(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\), yes.

Multiplying all together: 10 * 100 = 1000, 1000 * (-1) = -1000, -1000 * (1/8) = -125. Yep, that seems correct.

Just to be thorough, let me write out the entire expansion up to the term where \(k = 3\) to see if it makes sense.

The expansion is:

\[
\sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

So, for \(k = 0\): \(\binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^5 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^0 = 1 \times 10^5 x^{15} \times 1 = 100000x^{15}\)

For \(k = 1\): \(\binom{5}{1} (10x^3)^4 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^1 = 5 \times 10^4 x^{12} \times (-\frac{1}{2}x^{-2}) = 5 \times 10000 \times (-\frac{1}{2}) x^{10} = -25000x^{10}\)

For \(k = 2\): \(\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = 10 \times 1000 x^9 \times \frac{1}{4}x^{-4} = 10 \times 1000 \times \frac{1}{4} x^{5} = 2500x^{5}\)

For \(k = 3\): \(\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \times 100 x^6 \times (-\frac{1}{8})x^{-6} = 10 \times 100 \times (-\frac{1}{8}) x^{0} = -125\)

So, yes, the term when \(k = 3\) is indeed \(-125\), which is the constant term. The other terms have exponents 15, 10, 5, and so on, so they are not constants.

Therefore, I'm confident that the constant term is \(-125\).

**Final Answer**
The constant term is \boxed{-125}.
</think>

To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times (10x^3)^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying each part, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times (-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{15 - 5k}
\]

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be zero for the term to be constant. Solving \(15 - 5k = 0\) gives \(k = 3\).

For \(k = 3\), the term is:

\[
\binom{5}{3} \times 10^{2} \times (-1)^3 \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculating each part:

- \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
- \(10^{2} = 100\)
- \((-1)^3 = -1\)
- \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\)

\[
10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = -125

"Primeiro, identifico as coordenadas fornecidas: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4) e (x, y), com a condição de que x > 7.

Em um paralelogramo, os vetores opostos são iguais. Portanto, calculo os vetores entre os pontos conhecidos.

Considero os pontos A(5, 3), B(6, 8) e C(7, 4). O vetor AB é (1, 5) e o vetor AC é (2, 1).

Para encontrar o ponto D(x, y), uso a propriedade de que o vetor AD deve ser igual ao vetor BC. Calculando o vetor BC, que é (1, -4), aplico-o ao ponto A para encontrar D.

Assim, D = A + BC = (5 + 1, 3 - 4) = (6, -1). No entanto, como x > 7, verifico se há outro ponto que satisfaça essa condição.

Alternativamente, considero a possibilidade de D ser obtido a partir de outro ponto, como C + AB = (7 + 1, 4 + 5) = (8, 9). Neste caso, x = 8, que satisfaz x > 7.

Portanto, o ponto D é (8, 9), e a soma x + y é 8 + 9 = 17.

**Dados:**
- Coordenadas do paralelogramo: \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), e \( D(x, y) \) com \( x > 7 \).

**Propriedade do Paralelogramo:**
Em um paralelogramo, os vetores opostos são iguais. Ou seja:
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{DC} \quad \text{e} \quad \overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{BC}
\]

**Passo 1: Calcular os vetores**
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = B - A = (6 - 5, 8 - 3) = (1, 5)
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{AC} = C - A = (7 - 5, 4 - 3) = (2, 1)
\]

**Passo 2: Encontrar o ponto \( D \)**
Usando a propriedade \( \overrightarrow{AD} = \overrightarrow{BC} \):
\[
\overrightarrow{BC} = C - B = (7 - 6, 4 - 8) = (1, -4)
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{AD} = D - A = (x - 5, y - 3) = (1, -4)

Portanto:
\[
x - 5 = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 6
\]
\[
y - 3 = -4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -1
\]
No entanto, \( x = 6 \) não satisfaz \( x > 7 \). Portanto, consideramos outro ponto.

**Passo 3: Considerar outro ponto \( D \)**
Usando a propriedade \( \overrightarrow{DC} = \overrightarrow{AB} \):
\[
\overrightarrow{DC} = C - D = (7 - x, 4 - y) = (1, 5)
\]
Portanto:
\[
7 - x = 1 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 6

\[
4 - y = 5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -1

Novamente, \( x = 6 \) não satisfaz \( x > 7 \).

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of a, b, and c, where a and b are the vertical asymptotes and c is the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Yeah, that works. So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the function becomes f(x) = (2x)/[(x + 2)(x - 7)].

Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a is -2 and b is 7. Got that part.

Now, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² - 5x - 14, which is degree 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c is 0.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y = 0. If they were equal, it would be the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree was higher, there wouldn't be a horizontal asymptote, but an oblique one. So, yeah, c is 0.

So, now I have a = -2, b = 7, and c = 0. Adding them together: -2 + 7 + 0. That equals 5. So, a + b + c is 5.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in factoring the denominator. x² - 5x -14. Let me expand (x + 2)(x - 7) to check. x*x is x², x*(-7) is -7x, 2*x is 2x, and 2*(-7) is -14. So, combining the middle terms: -7x + 2x is -5x. Yep, that's correct. So, the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x = -2 and x = 7.

And for the horizontal asymptote, since the denominator's degree is higher, it's y = 0. So, c is 0. So, adding them up: -2 + 7 is 5, plus 0 is still 5. So, the answer should be 5.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that a + b + c is 5.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{5}\).
</think>

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7) \]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). Therefore, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

Next, we determine the horizontal asymptote. Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Hence, \( c = 0 \).

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \]

The value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) mentally, I can start by recognizing that \(99\) is close to \(100\), which is a round number and easier to work with.

First, I'll compute \(99^2\). Since \(99\) is \(100 - 1\), I can use the formula for the square of a binomial: \((a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\). Applying this, \(99^2 = (100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \times 100 \times 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\).

Next, I'll add \(99\) to \(9801\). This gives \(9801 + 99 = 9900\).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest real positive number C such that the norm of the matrix multiplied by any vector v is less than or equal to C times the norm of v. The matrix given is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

And I need to find the smallest C where this inequality holds for all vectors v in two dimensions. Hmm, okay. I remember that this has something to do with the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm is the maximum value of the ratio of the norm of the matrix times a vector to the norm of the vector, right? So, essentially, I need to find the maximum value of ||Av|| / ||v|| over all non-zero vectors v, and that maximum value will be the smallest C that satisfies the inequality.

So, to rephrase, I need to compute the operator norm of the given matrix. I think the operator norm is related to the singular values of the matrix. The operator norm is the largest singular value of the matrix. So, maybe I should compute the singular values of this matrix and then take the largest one as C.

But wait, how do I compute the singular values? I remember that the singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of the matrix multiplied by its transpose. So, first, I need to compute the matrix A^T A, where A is the given matrix, and then find its eigenvalues. The square roots of those eigenvalues will be the singular values, and the largest one will be the operator norm.

Let me write down the matrix A:

A = \[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the transpose of A, A^T, is:

A^T = \[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, let's compute A^T A:

A^T A = \[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Multiplying these two matrices:

First row, first column: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4
First row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6
Second row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6
Second row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13

So, A^T A is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues λ satisfy the characteristic equation det(A^T A - λI) = 0.

So, let's compute the determinant:

|A^T A - λI| = |(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - (6)(6)| = (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36

Expanding (4 - λ)(13 - λ):

4*13 - 4λ -13λ + λ² = 52 -17λ + λ²

Subtracting 36:

52 -17λ + λ² -36 = λ² -17λ +16

So, the characteristic equation is λ² -17λ +16 = 0

Let me solve this quadratic equation:

λ = [17 ± sqrt(17² - 4*1*16)] / 2 = [17 ± sqrt(289 - 64)] / 2 = [17 ± sqrt(225)] / 2 = [17 ±15]/2

So, the eigenvalues are:

(17 +15)/2 = 32/2 =16

and

(17 -15)/2 = 2/2 =1

So, the eigenvalues of A^T A are 16 and 1. Therefore, the singular values of A are the square roots of these, which are 4 and 1.

Hence, the singular values are 4 and 1. The largest singular value is 4, so the operator norm of A is 4. Therefore, the smallest C is 4.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, computing A^T A:

First row, first column: 2*2 + 0*0 =4, correct.

First row, second column: 2*3 +0*(-2)=6, correct.

Second row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0=6, correct.

Second row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2)=9+4=13, correct.

So, A^T A is correct.

Then, determinant: (4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36.

Expanding: 4*13=52, 4*(-λ)= -4λ, (-λ)*13= -13λ, (-λ)*(-λ)=λ². So, 52 -17λ + λ² -36= λ² -17λ +16, correct.

Solving λ² -17λ +16=0, discriminant is 289 -64=225, sqrt(225)=15, so λ=(17±15)/2, which gives 16 and 1, correct.

Singular values are sqrt(16)=4 and sqrt(1)=1, correct.

So, the operator norm is 4, so C=4.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is that the operator norm is the maximum stretching factor of the matrix. So, the matrix A is a combination of scaling and shearing. The eigenvalues of A are 2 and -2, but operator norm isn't necessarily the maximum of the absolute values of eigenvalues because the matrix isn't symmetric. So, in this case, the operator norm is larger than the spectral radius (which is 2). So, 4 is correct.

Alternatively, another approach is to parametrize the vector v as (x, y) and compute ||Av|| and ||v||, then find the maximum of ||Av|| / ||v||.

Let me try that approach to confirm.

Let v = (x, y). Then, Av = (2x + 3y, 0x -2y) = (2x +3y, -2y)

So, ||Av||² = (2x +3y)^2 + (-2y)^2 = (4x² +12xy +9y²) +4y² =4x² +12xy +13y²

||v||² =x² + y²

So, we need to maximize (4x² +12xy +13y²)/(x² + y²)

Let me denote t = y/x, assuming x ≠0. Then, the expression becomes:

(4 +12t +13t²)/(1 + t²)

We can set f(t) = (4 +12t +13t²)/(1 + t²)

To find the maximum of f(t), take derivative and set to zero.

Compute f'(t):

f'(t) = [ (12 +26t)(1 + t²) - (4 +12t +13t²)(2t) ] / (1 + t²)^2

Simplify numerator:

(12 +26t)(1 + t²) =12(1 + t²) +26t(1 + t²)=12 +12t² +26t +26t³

(4 +12t +13t²)(2t)=8t +24t² +26t³

Subtracting the second from the first:

[12 +12t² +26t +26t³] - [8t +24t² +26t³] =12 + (12t² -24t²) + (26t -8t) + (26t³ -26t³)

Simplify:

12 -12t² +18t +0= -12t² +18t +12

Set numerator equal to zero:

-12t² +18t +12=0

Multiply both sides by -1:

12t² -18t -12=0

Divide both sides by 6:

2t² -3t -2=0

Solve for t:

t = [3 ± sqrt(9 +16)] /4 = [3 ±5]/4

So, t=(3+5)/4=8/4=2, and t=(3-5)/4=-2/4=-1/2

So, critical points at t=2 and t=-1/2.

Now, compute f(t) at these points.

First, t=2:

f(2)= (4 +12*2 +13*(2)^2)/(1 + (2)^2)= (4 +24 +52)/(1 +4)=80/5=16

Second, t=-1/2:

f(-1/2)= (4 +12*(-1/2) +13*(1/4))/(1 +1/4)= (4 -6 +13/4)/(5/4)= ( (16/4 -24/4 +13/4) )/(5/4)= (5/4)/(5/4)=1

So, the maximum value is 16, and the minimum is 1. Therefore, the maximum of ||Av||² / ||v||² is 16, so the maximum of ||Av|| / ||v|| is sqrt(16)=4.

Therefore, C=4.

So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, another way is to note that the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of A^T A, which we found to be 16, so sqrt(16)=4.

Therefore, the smallest such C is 4.

**Final Answer**
The smallest real positive number \( C \) is \boxed{4}.
</think>

To find the smallest real positive number \( C \) such that
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
for all vectors \( \bold{v} \), we need to determine the operator norm of the given matrix. The operator norm is the largest singular value of the matrix, which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute the transpose of the matrix \( A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we calculate \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We then find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) by solving the characteristic equation:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]
\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Solving the quadratic equation:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]
gives the eigenvalues \( \lambda = 16 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \).

The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, which are 4 and 1. The largest singular value is 4, so the operator norm of \( A \) is 4.

Thus, the smallest real positive number \( C \) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\)? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. 

First, I know that exponentiation is a mathematical operation where a number, called the base, is raised to the power of another number, called the exponent. In this case, the base is 1, and the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\). That's a really big exponent! But maybe I don't need to calculate the entire exponent to find the result.

I remember that any number raised to any power is just 1 if the base is 1. For example, \(1^2 = 1\), \(1^3 = 1\), and so on. So, regardless of how big the exponent is, as long as the base is 1, the result should always be 1. 

Let me test this with smaller exponents to make sure I'm not missing something. If I take \(1^{2}\), that's 1. If I take \(1^{10}\), that's still 1. Even if the exponent is a huge number like \(1^{1000000}\), it's still 1. So, it seems consistent that no matter how large the exponent is, 1 raised to that exponent remains 1.

Wait, is there any case where 1 raised to a power isn't 1? I think in standard arithmetic, 1 to any real number exponent is always 1. Even if the exponent is negative or a fraction, like \(1^{-1}\) is still 1 because it's the reciprocal of 1, which is 1. Similarly, \(1^{1/2}\) is 1 because the square root of 1 is 1. So, it seems like 1 raised to any power is always 1.

Therefore, applying this to the original problem, \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\) should just be 1. The exponent is massive, but since the base is 1, it doesn't affect the outcome. 

I guess another way to think about it is that exponentiation with base 1 is a constant function. It doesn't matter what the input (the exponent) is; the output is always 1. So, even if the exponent is an astronomically large number like \(2^{235423523}\), the result is still 1.

Just to double-check, let me consider the properties of exponents. One of the exponent rules is that \(a^b = e^{b \ln a}\). If \(a = 1\), then \(\ln 1 = 0\), so \(1^b = e^{b \times 0} = e^0 = 1\). That confirms it again. No matter what \(b\) is, as long as \(a = 1\), the result is 1.

So, putting it all together, \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\) simplifies directly to 1 without needing to compute the exponent at all. It's a straightforward application of the exponent rule for base 1.

I don't think I'm missing anything here. The problem seems designed to test the understanding that 1 raised to any power is always 1, regardless of how large or complicated the exponent is. It's a good reminder that sometimes, even with intimidating numbers, the underlying mathematical principles can simplify things greatly.

In summary, after considering different angles and verifying with exponent rules, I'm confident that the result is 1.
</think>

The expression \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\) simplifies to 1 because any number raised to any power remains 1 if the base is 1.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) where \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that \( z^5 = 1 \) means that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). These roots can be expressed in the form \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we're looking at the primitive 5th roots of unity, which correspond to \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

Now, I need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Let me denote this expression as \( S \). So,

\[
S = z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}
\]

I notice that \( \frac{1}{z} \) is the same as \( z^4 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \) implies \( z^{-1} = z^{4} \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^{3} \). So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
S = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3
\]

So, \( S = z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \). Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. That is,

\[
1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0
\]

So, if I subtract 1 from both sides, I get:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1
\]

Wait, that's exactly the expression for \( S \)! So, does that mean \( S = -1 \)?

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from the equation \( z^5 = 1 \), we know that the sum of all roots is zero. Therefore, \( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \). So, subtracting 1 gives \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). Therefore, \( S = -1 \).

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using Euler's formula. Since \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \), then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-2\pi i k/5} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = e^{-4\pi i k/5} \). So, let's compute each term:

\( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \)

\( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-2\pi i k/5} \)

\( z^2 = e^{4\pi i k/5} \)

\( \frac{1}{z^2} = e^{-4\pi i k/5} \)

So, adding them up:

\[
S = e^{2\pi i k/5} + e^{-2\pi i k/5} + e^{4\pi i k/5} + e^{-4\pi i k/5}
\]

I know that \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), so applying this identity:

\[
S = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right)
\]

So, \( S = 2\left[ \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \right] \)

Hmm, now I need to compute this sum of cosines. Let me recall some trigonometric identities. There's a formula for the sum of cosines:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)
\]

Let me apply this to \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \). Let \( A = \frac{4\pi k}{5} \) and \( B = \frac{2\pi k}{5} \). Then,

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right)
\]

Calculating \( \frac{A + B}{2} = \frac{\frac{4\pi k}{5} + \frac{2\pi k}{5}}{2} = \frac{6\pi k}{10} = \frac{3\pi k}{5} \)

And \( \frac{A - B}{2} = \frac{\frac{4\pi k}{5} - \frac{2\pi k}{5}}{2} = \frac{2\pi k}{10} = \frac{\pi k}{5} \)

So,

\[
\cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) = 2\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right)
\]

Therefore, \( S = 2 \times 2\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right) = 4\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right) \)

Hmm, not sure if this helps directly, but maybe I can compute the numerical value. Let's pick a specific \( k \). Since \( k \) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, let's choose \( k = 1 \) for simplicity.

So, \( k = 1 \):

\[
S = 4\cos\left( \frac{3\pi}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)
\]

I know that \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), wait, actually, \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, let me recall exact values.

I remember that \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, actually, let me compute it properly.

The exact value of \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps I should recall that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute it numerically.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for product of cosines. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that \( \cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A+B) + \cos(A-B)] \). So, applying this to \( \cos\left( \frac{3\pi}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \):

\[
\cos\left( \frac{3\pi}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos\left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) + \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \right]
\]

So, substituting back into \( S \):

\[
S = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} \left[ \cos\left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) + \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \right] = 2 \left[ \cos\left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) + \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \right]
\]

But \( \cos\left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = \cos\left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{5} \right) = -\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \), and \( \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \) is just another cosine term.

So, substituting:

\[
S = 2 \left[ -\cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) + \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \right]
\]

Hmm, this seems to be going in circles. Maybe I should compute the numerical values.

Let me compute \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \) and \( \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \).

I know that \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \approx 0.8090 \) and \( \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \approx 0.3090 \). So,

\[
S = 2 \left[ -0.8090 + 0.3090 \right] = 2 \times (-0.5) = -1
\]

So, that gives \( S = -1 \). Hmm, that's consistent with my earlier result.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the minimal polynomial for \( z \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). So, \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \), which is exactly the expression for \( S \). So, that confirms \( S = -1 \).

Wait, so both methods give me \( S = -1 \). That seems solid. So, I think the answer is \( -1 \).

But just to make sure, let me try another approach. Let me consider \( z \) as a root of \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), so \( z^5 = 1 \). Then, \( z \neq 1 \), so \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity.

Let me denote \( S = z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \). As I know, the sum of all roots is zero, so \( 1 + S = 0 \), hence \( S = -1 \). Yep, that's straightforward.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute \( S \) by considering \( z + 1/z \) and \( z^2 + 1/z^2 \) separately.

Let me compute \( z + 1/z \). Since \( z \) is a root of unity, \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\left( \frac{2\pi k}{5} \right) \). Similarly, \( z^2 + 1/z^2 = 2\cos\left( \frac{4\pi k}{5} \right) \). So, \( S = 2\cos\left( \frac{2\pi k}{5} \right) + 2\cos\left( \frac{4\pi k}{5} \right) \).

Now, let me compute this sum. Let me denote \( \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{5} \). Then, \( S = 2\cos\theta + 2\cos(2\theta) \).

I can use the identity for sum of cosines:

\[
\cos\theta + \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos\left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the identity:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)
\]

So, applying this to \( \cos\theta + \cos(2\theta) \):

Let \( A = 2\theta \) and \( B = \theta \). Then,

\[
\cos\theta + \cos(2\theta) = 2\cos\left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

So, substituting back into \( S \):

\[
S = 2 \times 2\cos\left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 4\cos\left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

But \( \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{5} \), so:

\[
\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{3 \times 2\pi k}{5 \times 2} = \frac{3\pi k}{5}

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), I start by recalling that \(\sec x\) is the reciprocal of \(\cos x\). This allows me to rewrite the first term as \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Next, I observe that the second term, \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), can be expressed as \(\tan x\). However, to combine the two terms effectively, I'll keep them in their current form.

Now, I have the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). To combine these fractions, I need a common denominator, which is \(\cos x \sin x\). I rewrite the second term with this denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(\sin x\), resulting in \(\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Subtracting the two fractions gives me \(\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). I recognize that \(1 - \sin^2 x\) is equal to \(\cos^2 x\) based on the Pythagorean identity.

Substituting this back into the expression, I have \(\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). Simplifying the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator leaves me with \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\).

Finally, I recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is \(\cot x\).

"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, that means for every y-value, there should be some x such that f(x) = y. So, the function should be surjective, right? Or maybe it's about the function being onto, covering all possible y-values.

Let me think. If the function is to intersect every horizontal line, then for every real number y, there must be at least one x such that f(x) = y. So, the function f(x) must be surjective onto the real numbers. But wait, f(x) is a piecewise function, so I need to check both pieces.

First, let's analyze each piece separately.

For x ≥ a, f(x) = ax². This is a quadratic function. Depending on the value of a, it can open upwards or downwards. If a is positive, it opens upwards, and if a is negative, it opens downwards. The vertex of this parabola is at (a, f(a)) which is (a, a*(a)²) = (a, a³). So, the minimum or maximum value of this quadratic piece is at y = a³.

For x < a, f(x) = ax + 2a. This is a linear function with slope a and y-intercept 2a. So, it's a straight line. If a is positive, it's increasing; if a is negative, it's decreasing.

Now, to ensure that the entire function f(x) is surjective, meaning it covers all real numbers y, both pieces need to cover the necessary parts of the y-axis without leaving gaps.

Let me consider the two cases: a positive and a negative.

Case 1: a > 0.

In this case, the quadratic piece f(x) = ax² for x ≥ a opens upwards. Its minimum value is at x = a, which is y = a³. So, for x ≥ a, f(x) can take all values from y = a³ to infinity.

The linear piece f(x) = ax + 2a for x < a is an increasing line because a is positive. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a.

So, the linear piece covers from negative infinity up to y = a² + 2a.

Now, for the entire function to be surjective, the maximum value of the linear piece (which is a² + 2a) must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of the quadratic piece (which is a³). Otherwise, there would be a gap between a³ and a² + 2a where no y-values are covered.

So, the condition is:

a² + 2a ≥ a³

Let me write that down:

a² + 2a ≥ a³

Let's rearrange this inequality:

a³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0

Factor out an a:

a(a² - a - 2) ≤ 0

Factor the quadratic:

a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0

So, the critical points are a = -1, 0, 2.

We are considering a > 0, so we can ignore a = -1 and a = 0.

We need to test intervals between 0 and 2, and beyond 2.

For a between 0 and 2, let's pick a = 1:

1*(1 - 2)*(1 + 1) = 1*(-1)*(2) = -2 ≤ 0. So, the inequality holds.

For a > 2, let's pick a = 3:

3*(9 - 3 - 2) = 3*(4) = 12 > 0. So, the inequality does not hold.

Therefore, for a > 0, the inequality a³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0 holds when 0 < a ≤ 2.

So, in this case, the maximum a is 2.

But wait, let me check if a = 2 actually works.

At a = 2, the linear piece is f(x) = 2x + 4 for x < 2. As x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 2*2 + 4 = 8.

The quadratic piece is f(x) = 2x² for x ≥ 2. At x = 2, f(2) = 2*(4) = 8. So, the function is continuous at x = 2.

Moreover, the linear piece goes from negative infinity up to 8, and the quadratic piece goes from 8 to infinity. So, together, they cover all real numbers y. Therefore, a = 2 is acceptable.

Case 2: a < 0.

Now, let's consider a negative. So, a is negative.

For x ≥ a, f(x) = ax². Since a is negative, this is a downward-opening parabola. Its vertex is at (a, a³). Since a is negative, a³ is also negative. The maximum value of this quadratic piece is y = a³, and it goes down to negative infinity as x moves away from a.

For x < a, f(x) = ax + 2a. Since a is negative, this is a decreasing line. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity (because a is negative, so ax becomes positive and large as x is negative and large in magnitude). As x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a.

So, the linear piece covers from positive infinity down to y = a² + 2a.

The quadratic piece covers from y = a³ down to negative infinity.

So, for the entire function to be surjective, the maximum value of the quadratic piece (which is a³) must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of the linear piece (which is a² + 2a). Otherwise, there would be a gap between a² + 2a and a³ where no y-values are covered.

So, the condition is:

a³ ≥ a² + 2a

Let me write that:

a³ - a² - 2a ≥ 0

Factor out an a:

a(a² - a - 2) ≥ 0

Factor the quadratic:

a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≥ 0

So, critical points are a = -1, 0, 2.

We are considering a < 0, so we focus on a < -1 and -1 < a < 0.

Let's test intervals:

For a < -1, say a = -2:

-2*(4 - (-2) - 2) = -2*(4 + 2 - 2) = -2*(4) = -8 < 0. So, the inequality does not hold.

For -1 < a < 0, say a = -0.5:

-0.5*(0.25 - (-0.5) - 2) = -0.5*(0.25 + 0.5 - 2) = -0.5*(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. So, the inequality holds.

Therefore, for a < 0, the inequality a³ - a² - 2a ≥ 0 holds when -1 < a < 0.

But wait, we need the function to be surjective. So, for a in (-1, 0), the linear piece goes from positive infinity down to a² + 2a, and the quadratic piece goes from a³ down to negative infinity. Since a³ is less than a² + 2a (because a is negative, a² is positive, 2a is negative, but let's compute a² + 2a for a in (-1, 0)).

Wait, let's take a specific example, say a = -0.5.

Then, a² + 2a = 0.25 + (-1) = -0.75.

a³ = (-0.5)^3 = -0.125.

So, a³ = -0.125 is greater than a² + 2a = -0.75.

So, the linear piece goes from positive infinity down to -0.75, and the quadratic piece goes from -0.125 down to negative infinity. So, there is a gap between -0.75 and -0.125 where the function doesn't cover. Therefore, the function is not surjective.

Wait, that's a problem. So, even though the inequality a³ ≥ a² + 2a holds for -1 < a < 0, the function still has a gap. So, maybe my initial condition was wrong.

Wait, perhaps I need to ensure that the maximum of the linear piece is greater than or equal to the minimum of the quadratic piece? Or maybe the other way around.

Wait, for a < 0, the linear piece is decreasing, so it goes from positive infinity down to a² + 2a. The quadratic piece is a downward opening parabola, so it goes from a³ down to negative infinity. So, to cover all y-values, the maximum of the linear piece (which is positive infinity) is already covered, but the minimum of the linear piece is a² + 2a, and the maximum of the quadratic piece is a³. So, to cover all y-values, we need that a³ ≥ a² + 2a, so that the quadratic piece covers up to a³, which is above the linear piece's minimum.

Wait, but in the example with a = -0.5, a³ = -0.125 and a² + 2a = -0.75. So, a³ > a² + 2a, meaning that the quadratic piece goes up to -0.125, and the linear piece goes down to -0.75. So, the function covers from positive infinity down to -0.75, and from -0.125 down to negative infinity. So, the gap is between -0.75 and -0.125. So, the function doesn't cover y-values between -0.75 and -0.125.

Therefore, to have no gap, we need that the maximum of the quadratic piece (a³) is greater than or equal to the minimum of the linear piece (a² + 2a). But in this case, a³ is greater than a² + 2a, but the linear piece's minimum is lower than the quadratic piece's maximum, so there is a gap.

Wait, maybe I need the other way around. Maybe the minimum of the quadratic piece (which is negative infinity) is less than the maximum of the linear piece (which is positive infinity), but that's always true. The problem is the overlap in the middle.

Wait, perhaps I need the maximum of the linear piece (which is positive infinity) and the minimum of the quadratic piece (negative infinity) but the issue is the overlapping region.

Wait, maybe I need the linear piece's minimum to be greater than or equal to the quadratic piece's maximum? But that would mean a² + 2a ≥ a³, which is the same as the case when a > 0.

But for a < 0, a² + 2a is less than a³ because a² is positive, 2a is negative, and a³ is negative. So, a² + 2a could be either positive or negative depending on a.

Wait, let's compute a² + 2a for a < 0.

a² is positive, 2a is negative. So, a² + 2a = a(a + 2). For a < 0, if a > -2, then a + 2 is positive, so a² + 2a is positive times positive, which is positive. If a < -2, then a + 2 is negative, so a² + 2a is positive times negative, which is negative.

So, for a between -2 and 0, a² + 2a is positive. For a < -2, a² + 2a is negative.

Similarly, a³ is negative for a < 0.

So, for a between -2 and 0, a² + 2a is positive, and a³ is negative. So, the linear piece goes from positive infinity down to a positive number, and the quadratic piece goes from a negative number down to negative infinity. So, there is a gap between a² + 2a (positive) and a³ (negative). So, the function doesn't cover y-values between a³ and a² + 2a.

For a < -2, a² + 2a is negative, and a³ is also negative. So, the linear piece goes from positive infinity down to a negative number, and the quadratic piece goes from a negative number down to negative infinity. So, the function covers from positive infinity down to a² + 2a, and from a³ down to negative infinity. So, if a² + 2a ≥ a³, then the function would cover all y-values. But wait, a² + 2a is negative, and a³ is also negative. So, if a² + 2a ≥ a³, meaning that a² + 2a is to the right of a³ on the number line, then the function would cover from positive infinity down to a² + 2a, and from a³ down to negative infinity. So, if a² + 2a ≥ a³, then the gap between a³ and a² + 2a is closed.

Wait, let's test with a = -3.

a = -3.

a² + 2a = 9 + (-6) = 3.

a³ = -27.

So, a² + 2a = 3, which is greater than a³ = -27. So, the linear piece goes from positive infinity down to 3, and the quadratic piece goes from -27 down to negative infinity. So, the function covers y from positive infinity down to 3, and from -27 down to negative infinity. So, there is a gap between 3 and -27, which is a huge gap. So, the function is not surjective.

Wait, that's not good. So, even if a² + 2a ≥ a³, which is true for a = -3, the function still has a gap.

Wait, maybe I need a different approach.

Perhaps, for the function to be surjective, the union of the ranges of both pieces must cover all real numbers. So, the range of the linear piece is (-∞, a² + 2a) if a > 0, or (a² + 2a, ∞) if a < 0? Wait, no.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 for which there exists an x in [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The parameter λ controls the shape of the parabola. When λ is between 0 and 4, the function maps the interval [0,1] into itself, which is good because we're dealing with x in [0,1].

The problem is asking for λ values where there's some x such that f(x) isn't equal to x, but when you apply f again, you get back to x. In other words, x is a periodic point of period 2 for the function f. So, x is not a fixed point, but it's part of a 2-cycle.

To find such λ, I need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x, but exclude the solutions where f(x) = x. So, first, let's write down the equation f(f(x)) = x.

Given f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let's compute that:

f(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)].

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

We need this equal to x:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me write that equation out:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) = x.

Wait, let me double-check that expansion. The term [1 - λx(1 - x)] is 1 - λx + λx^2, right? Yes, because λx(1 - x) = λx - λx^2, so subtracting that from 1 gives 1 - λx + λx^2.

So, the equation is:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) = x.

Now, let's bring everything to one side:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - x = 0.

Factor out an x:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1] = 0.

So, the solutions are either x = 0 or the term in the brackets equals zero.

But x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is also a fixed point because f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1) = 0, which is different from 1 unless λ is 0, but λ is between 0 and 4. So, x=1 is not a fixed point unless λ=0, which is a trivial case.

But in our problem, we need f(x) ≠ x, so x=0 and x=1 are fixed points, so we need to exclude them. Therefore, we need to solve the equation inside the brackets:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1 = 0.

Let me expand this expression step by step.

First, expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2):

Multiply 1 by each term: 1*(1) = 1, 1*(-λx) = -λx, 1*(λx^2) = λx^2.

Then, multiply -x by each term: -x*(1) = -x, -x*(-λx) = λx^2, -x*(λx^2) = -λx^3.

So, combining all these terms:

1 - λx + λx^2 - x + λx^2 - λx^3.

Now, let's combine like terms:

Constant term: 1.

Linear terms: -λx - x = -(λ + 1)x.

Quadratic terms: λx^2 + λx^2 = 2λx^2.

Cubic term: -λx^3.

So, altogether:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

λ^2 [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3] - 1 = 0.

Let me distribute λ^2:

λ^2 * 1 = λ^2,

λ^2 * [ - (λ + 1)x ] = -λ^2(λ + 1)x,

λ^2 * [2λx^2] = 2λ^3x^2,

λ^2 * [ -λx^3 ] = -λ^3x^3.

So, putting it all together:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3 - 1 = 0.

Now, let's write this as a polynomial in x:

-λ^3x^3 + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

To make it a bit cleaner, let's multiply both sides by -1:

λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

So, the equation is:

λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in x. We need to find x in [0,1] such that this equation holds, but x is not a fixed point, meaning x ≠ 0 and x ≠ 1 (since f(0)=0 and f(1)=0, which is different from 1 unless λ=0, which is trivial). So, we need non-trivial solutions.

But solving a cubic equation can be complicated. Maybe there's a smarter way. Let me think.

We know that f(f(x)) = x implies that x is a periodic point of period 2. So, the solutions to f(f(x)) = x include all fixed points (where f(x) = x) and the period-2 points. So, if we can factor out the fixed points from the equation f(f(x)) = x, the remaining solutions will be the period-2 points.

So, let's consider the equation f(f(x)) = x. We can write this as f(f(x)) - x = 0. We already know that f(x) - x = 0 gives the fixed points. So, perhaps f(f(x)) - x is divisible by f(x) - x.

Let me check that. Let me denote g(x) = f(f(x)) - x. Then, if x is a fixed point, f(x) = x, so f(f(x)) = f(x) = x, so g(x) = x - x = 0. Therefore, f(x) - x divides g(x).

Therefore, we can factor g(x) as (f(x) - x) * h(x), where h(x) is some quadratic polynomial. Then, the roots of g(x) = 0 are the roots of f(x) - x = 0 and the roots of h(x) = 0.

Therefore, to find the period-2 points, we can factor out f(x) - x from g(x) and solve the remaining quadratic equation.

So, let's compute g(x) = f(f(x)) - x.

We already have f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2). So,

g(x) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - x.

Let me factor out x:

g(x) = x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1].

We already did this earlier. So, as before, we have:

g(x) = x [λ^2 (1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3) - 1].

Wait, no, actually, earlier we expanded it and got a cubic. But perhaps instead of expanding, we can factor out f(x) - x.

Let me try that.

We have g(x) = f(f(x)) - x.

We can write this as f(f(x)) - f(x) + f(x) - x.

So, g(x) = [f(f(x)) - f(x)] + [f(x) - x].

Notice that f(f(x)) - f(x) = f(f(x)) - f(x) = f(x)(λ(1 - f(x)) - 1). Wait, maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor f(f(x)) - x as (f(x) - x)(something). Let me try polynomial division.

Let me denote f(x) = λx(1 - x) = λx - λx^2.

So, f(x) - x = (λx - λx^2) - x = (λ - 1)x - λx^2.

So, f(x) - x = -λx^2 + (λ - 1)x.

We can factor this as x(-λx + (λ - 1)).

So, f(x) - x = x(-λx + (λ - 1)).

Now, let's perform polynomial division of g(x) by f(x) - x.

But g(x) is a cubic, and f(x) - x is quadratic, so the result should be linear.

Let me write g(x) = (f(x) - x) * (ax + b) + remainder.

But since f(x) - x is quadratic, the remainder should be linear or constant. But since g(x) is cubic, and f(x) - x is quadratic, the division should result in a linear term with no remainder.

Wait, let me try to compute it.

Let me write g(x) = f(f(x)) - x.

We have f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2).

So, g(x) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - x.

Let me factor out x:

g(x) = x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1].

Now, let me compute the term inside the brackets:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1.

Let me expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2):

As before, it's 1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3.

So, multiplying by λ^2:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3.

Subtracting 1:

λ^2 - 1 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3.

So, g(x) = x [λ^2 - 1 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3].

Now, let's factor out f(x) - x from g(x). Since f(x) - x = -λx^2 + (λ - 1)x, which is quadratic, and g(x) is cubic, the division should give a linear term.

Let me denote:

g(x) = (f(x) - x) * (Ax + B).

So, let's compute (f(x) - x)(Ax + B):

(-λx^2 + (λ - 1)x)(Ax + B) =

-λx^2 * Ax + (-λx^2)*B + (λ - 1)x * Ax + (λ - 1)x * B

= -λA x^3 - λB x^2 + (λ - 1)A x^2 + (λ - 1)B x.

Combine like terms:

-λA x^3 + [ -λB + (λ - 1)A ] x^2 + (λ - 1)B x.

Now, we want this to equal g(x):

g(x) = -λ^3x^3 + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1).

Wait, no, earlier we had:

g(x) = x [λ^2 - 1 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3].

So, expanding that, g(x) = (λ^2 - 1)x - λ^2(λ + 1)x^2 + 2λ^3x^3 - λ^3x^4.

Wait, hold on, that can't be right because earlier I thought g(x) was cubic, but now it's quartic? Wait, no, let me check.

Wait, no, f(f(x)) is a cubic function because f(x) is quadratic, so f(f(x)) is degree 4? Wait, no, f(x) is quadratic, so f(f(x)) is degree 4? Wait, hold on, f(x) = λx(1 - x) is quadratic, so f(f(x)) is f evaluated at a quadratic, which would be degree 4. So, f(f(x)) is quartic, so f(f(x)) - x is quartic. But earlier, when I expanded, I thought it was cubic, but that must have been a mistake.

Wait, let me recast this.

Wait, f(x) = λx(1 - x) is quadratic, so f(f(x)) is f evaluated at a quadratic, which is degree 4. So, f(f(x)) is quartic, so f(f(x)) - x is quartic. Therefore, g(x) is quartic, not cubic. So, my earlier expansion was wrong because I thought f(f(x)) was cubic, but it's actually quartic.

Wait, let me recast this.

Compute f(f(x)):

f(x) = λx(1 - x) = λx - λx^2.

Then, f(f(x)) = λ*(f(x))*(1 - f(x)).

So, f(f(x)) = λ*(λx - λx","[4, '4']","(3,4]",[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the measure in degrees of the smallest positive angle θ such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The fraction has a numerator and a denominator, both of which are combinations of sine and cosine terms with different angles. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it using some trigonometric identities.

First, let me write down the given expression:

tan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]

Alright, so both the numerator and the denominator have four terms each. I notice that in the numerator, there are products of cosines and sines with angles that add up to certain values. Maybe I can use the cosine addition formula here. The formula is cos(A ± B) = cosA cosB ∓ sinA sinB. Let me see if I can group the terms in the numerator accordingly.

Looking at the numerator: cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20°. That looks like cos(5° + 20°) because cosA cosB - sinA sinB = cos(A + B). So, cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20° = cos25°. Similarly, the next two terms are cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50°, which would be cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°. So, the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°.

Wait, let me check that again. The numerator is cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50. So, grouping the first two and the last two terms:

[cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20] + [cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50] = cos(5+20) + cos(35+50) = cos25° + cos85°. Yeah, that seems right.

Now, the denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50. Hmm, this also has four terms. Let me see if I can group them similarly. The first two terms: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20. That looks like sin(A + B) because sinA cosB + cosA sinB = sin(A + B). So, sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 = sin(5 + 20) = sin25°. Similarly, the next two terms: -sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50. That can be written as -[sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50] = -sin(35 + 50) = -sin85°. So, the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°.

So now, the expression becomes:

tan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]

Alright, so now I have tan θ = (cos25 + cos85)/(sin25 - sin85). Maybe I can simplify this further using sum-to-product identities.

For the numerator, cos25 + cos85. The sum-to-product identity for cosines is:

cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]

Similarly, for the denominator, sin25 - sin85. The identity for sine is:

sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]

Let me apply these identities.

First, numerator: cos25 + cos85.

A = 25°, B = 85°, so (A+B)/2 = (25+85)/2 = 110/2 = 55°, and (A-B)/2 = (25-85)/2 = (-60)/2 = -30°. So,

cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos55° cos(-30°). But cosine is even, so cos(-30°) = cos30°. Therefore, numerator becomes 2 cos55° cos30°.

Similarly, denominator: sin25 - sin85.

A = 25°, B = 85°, so (A+B)/2 = 55°, and (A-B)/2 = -30°. So,

sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos55° sin(-30°). Sine is odd, so sin(-30°) = -sin30°. Therefore, denominator becomes 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°.

So now, the expression is:

tan θ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°]

I can cancel out the 2 cos55° terms from numerator and denominator, as long as cos55° ≠ 0, which it isn't because 55° is not 90° or 270°, so that's fine.

So, tan θ = [cos30°] / [-sin30°] = - [cos30° / sin30°] = -cot30°

But cot30° is 1/tan30°, and tan30° is √3/3, so cot30° is 3/√3 = √3. Therefore, tan θ = -√3.

Wait, so tan θ = -√3. Hmm, so θ is an angle whose tangent is -√3. But the question asks for the smallest positive angle θ. So, tangent is negative, which means θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. But since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, it's likely in the fourth quadrant, but let me think.

Wait, actually, the tangent function has a period of 180°, so the general solution for tan θ = -√3 is θ = -60° + 180°k, where k is an integer. But we need the smallest positive angle, so let's find θ in the range of 0° to 180°, I think.

Wait, tan θ = -√3. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. But since we need the smallest positive angle, 120° is smaller than 300°, so θ = 120°. But wait, is 120° the smallest positive angle? Or is there a smaller positive angle?

Wait, no, because 120° is less than 180°, and 300° is more than 180°, so 120° is the smallest positive angle where tan θ = -√3. But wait, hold on, is 120° the angle where tan is negative? Let me check.

Yes, in the second quadrant, tan is negative because sine is positive and cosine is negative, so tangent is negative. So, θ = 120° is the angle in the second quadrant where tan θ = -√3. So, that's the smallest positive angle.

But wait, let me double-check my steps because sometimes when simplifying, signs can flip.

Starting from tan θ = [cos25 + cos85] / [sin25 - sin85]. Then, using sum-to-product, I got numerator as 2 cos55 cos30 and denominator as -2 cos55 sin30. So, tan θ = (2 cos55 cos30) / (-2 cos55 sin30) = - (cos30 / sin30) = -cot30 = -√3. So, that seems correct.

So, tan θ = -√3, so θ is 120°, since tan120° = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So, yes, θ = 120° is correct.

But wait, is there a smaller positive angle? Let me think. The tangent function has a period of 180°, so the solutions are θ = 120° + 180°k, where k is integer. So, the smallest positive angle is 120°, because if k = 0, θ = 120°, and if k = -1, θ = -60°, which is negative, so not positive. So, 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but hold on, is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is greater than 90°, but maybe there's a smaller angle in the fourth quadrant? But 300° is larger than 120°, so 120° is still the smallest positive angle.

Alternatively, sometimes, depending on the context, the principal value of arctangent is between -90° and 90°, but since we're asked for the smallest positive angle, 120° is correct.

Wait, but let me think again. If tan θ = -√3, then θ could be in the second or fourth quadrant. The reference angle is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. So, 120° is the smallest positive angle where tan θ = -√3.

Therefore, θ = 120°.

But wait, let me check if I made any mistake in the simplification steps.

Starting with numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50.

Grouped as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos25 + cos85.

Denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50.

Grouped as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin25 - sin85.

Then, numerator: cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos55 cos30.

Denominator: sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos55 (-sin30).

So, tan θ = (2 cos55 cos30) / (-2 cos55 sin30) = - (cos30 / sin30) = -cot30 = -√3.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, tan θ = -√3, so θ = 120°, which is the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the original expression numerically to see if it indeed equals tan120°, which is -√3 ≈ -1.732.

Let me compute numerator and denominator numerically.

First, compute numerator:

cos5° ≈ 0.9962, cos20° ≈ 0.9397, cos35° ≈ 0.8192, cos50° ≈ 0.6428.

sin5° ≈ 0.0872, sin20° ≈ 0.3420, sin35° ≈ 0.5736, sin50° ≈ 0.7660.

Compute numerator:

cos5 cos20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.9365

cos35 cos50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.5265

sin5 sin20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0298

sin35 sin50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.4395

So, numerator ≈ 0.9365 + 0.5265 - 0.0298 - 0.4395 ≈ (0.9365 + 0.5265) - (0.0298 + 0.4395) ≈ 1.463 - 0.4693 ≈ 0.9937

Denominator:

sin5 cos20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0819

sin35 cos50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.3695

cos5 sin20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.3405

cos35 sin50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.6284

So, denominator ≈ 0.0819 - 0.3695 + 0.3405 - 0.6284 ≈ (0.0819 + 0.3405) - (0.3695 + 0.6284) ≈ 0.4224 - 0.9979 ≈ -0.5755

So, tan θ ≈ 0.9937 / (-0.5755) ≈ -1.727, which is approximately -√3 ≈ -1.732. So, that's very close, considering the approximations in the decimal places. So, that confirms that tan θ ≈ -√3, so θ ≈ 120°, which is correct.

Therefore, the smallest positive angle θ is 12","[12, '12']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",True

"Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with two variables. I remember that to find maxima or minima, we can use calculus, specifically finding partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can simplify or analyze the function a bit.

First, let me note the domain: \( x \) and \( y \) are each in the interval [-1, 1]. So, the square roots are defined because \( 1 - y^2 \) and \( 1 - x^2 \) will be non-negative. Also, since we're dealing with square roots, the function might have some symmetry or properties that can be exploited.

Looking at the function \( f(x, y) \), it's symmetric in a way. If I swap \( x \) and \( y \), the function remains the same. That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). So, maybe the maximum occurs when \( x = y \)? That's a common scenario in symmetric functions. Let me test that idea.

Assume \( x = y \). Then, the function becomes:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
So, now I have a single-variable function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). I can find its maximum by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

Let me compute the derivative \( g'(x) \):
First, write \( g(x) = 2x (1 - x^2)^{1/2} \).
Using the product rule:
\[
g'(x) = 2(1 - x^2)^{1/2} + 2x \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x)
\]
Simplify:
\[
g'(x) = 2\sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \left( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right)
\]
\[
g'(x) = 2\sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Combine the terms:
\[
g'(x) = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Set \( g'(x) = 0 \):
\[
2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies 4x^2 = 2 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Since we're looking for the maximum, and \( x \) is in [-1, 1], let's consider \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) because the function \( g(x) \) is positive in the first quadrant and negative in the third, so the maximum should be at the positive value.

Compute \( g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \):
\[
g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1
\]
So, when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1. Hmm, that's a candidate for maximum. But wait, is this the global maximum? Maybe I should check other critical points or consider the boundaries.

Alternatively, perhaps the maximum occurs when one variable is 1 or -1. Let me test the boundaries.

Case 1: \( x = 1 \). Then, \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum of this is 1 when \( y = 0 \). So, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Case 2: \( x = -1 \). Similarly, \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum here is 0 when \( y = \pm 1 \), but since it's negative otherwise, the maximum is 0, which is less than 1.

Case 3: \( y = 1 \). Then, \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum is 1 when \( x = 0 \). So, \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Case 4: \( y = -1 \). Similarly, \( f(x, -1) = x \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum is 0 when \( x = \pm 1 \), which is less than 1.

So, on the boundaries, the maximum value is 1, same as when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Hmm, so both the interior critical point and the boundary points give a maximum of 1. So, is 1 the maximum value?

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe there's a point where \( x \neq y \) that gives a higher value. Let's try to use calculus for the general case.

Compute the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), set them to zero, and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

First, compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x) = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Similarly, compute \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - y^2)^{-1/2}(-2y) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]
Set both partial derivatives equal to zero:
1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \)

So, from equation 1:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
From equation 2:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]
Let me denote \( A = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and \( B = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). Then, equation 1 becomes \( B = \frac{xy}{A} \) and equation 2 becomes \( A = \frac{xy}{B} \).

Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:
\[
A = \frac{xy}{B} = \frac{xy}{\frac{xy}{A}} = A
\]
Wait, that just gives \( A = A \), which is always true. So, maybe I need another approach.

Let me square both sides of equation 1:
\[
(1 - y^2) = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
Expand the left side:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
Subtract \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]
So, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Interesting, so the critical points lie on the unit circle.

Now, from equation 1:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
But since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we can express \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \). So, \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{x^2} = |x| \). Similarly, \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = |y| \).

Assuming \( x \) and \( y \) are positive (since we're looking for maximum, likely in the first quadrant), we can drop the absolute values:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = x \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{1 - x^2} = y
\]
So, substituting back into equation 1:
\[
x = \frac{xy}{y} = x
\]
Which is consistent. So, the critical points are where \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). But since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), this is consistent.

So, substituting \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \):
\[
x = \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} = \sqrt{x^2} = |x|
\]
Again, assuming \( x \) is positive, this gives \( x = x \), which is always true. So, the critical points are all points on the unit circle in the first quadrant. But we need to find specific points where the function \( f(x, y) \) is maximized.

Wait, but earlier when I assumed \( x = y \), I found that \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) gives \( f(x, y) = 1 \). Let me check if this point lies on the unit circle: \( x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \). Yes, it does. So, that's one critical point.

But are there other critical points on the unit circle? For example, if \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 0 \), but we already saw that \( f(1, 0) = 1 \). Similarly, \( x = 0 \), \( y = 1 \), \( f(0, 1) = 1 \). So, all these points give the same function value of 1.

Wait, so is 1 the maximum? Or is there a point where \( f(x, y) \) is greater than 1?

Let me test another point on the unit circle. Let's say \( x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), then \( y = \sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \). Compute \( f(x, y) \):
\[
f\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]
Same value. Hmm, so it seems that all points on the unit circle in the first quadrant give \( f(x, y) = 1 \). So, is 1 the maximum?

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe if I take points not on the unit circle, but inside, could I get a higher value? For example, take \( x = y = \frac{1}{2} \). Then:
\[
f\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866
\]
Which is less than 1. So, that's lower.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, I remember that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found using the cross product. Let me think about how that works.

First, I recall that the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors OA and OB. So, the formula should be something like (1/2) times the magnitude of OA cross OB. That makes sense because the cross product gives a vector perpendicular to both OA and OB, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB. So, half of that would be the area of the triangle.

Alright, so I need to compute the cross product of OA and OB. Let me write down the vectors:

OA = (1, 2, 3)
OB = (-3, -2, 1)

The cross product OA × OB can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of OA in the second row, and the components of OB in the third row. So, setting that up:

i  j  k
1  2  3
-3 -2 1

Calculating the determinant, it should be:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i component: 2*1 is 2, and 3*(-2) is -6. So, 2 - (-6) is 2 + 6, which is 8. So, the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component: It's subtracted, so it's - [1*1 - 3*(-3)]. Let's compute inside the brackets: 1*1 is 1, and 3*(-3) is -9. So, 1 - (-9) is 1 + 9, which is 10. So, the j component is -10j.

Now, the k component: 1*(-2) is -2, and 2*(-3) is -6. So, -2 - (-6) is -2 + 6, which is 4. So, the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Wait, let me double-check that. For the j component, I think I might have messed up the sign. The formula is i*(OA_y * OB_z - OA_z * OB_y) - j*(OA_x * OB_z - OA_z * OB_x) + k*(OA_x * OB_y - OA_y * OB_x). So, plugging in:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) = i*(2 + 6) = 8i

-j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -j*(1 + 9) = -10j

k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3)) = k*(-2 + 6) = 4k

Yes, that seems correct. So, OA × OB = (8, -10, 4).

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2). Let's compute each term:

8^2 = 64

(-10)^2 = 100

4^2 = 16

Adding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180

So, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Hmm, sqrt(180) can be simplified. Let's see, 180 is 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). So, the magnitude of OA × OB is 6√5.

Therefore, the area of triangle OAB is half of that, which is (1/2)*6√5 = 3√5.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the cross product:

OA = (1, 2, 3)
OB = (-3, -2, 1)

Cross product components:

i: (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8

j: -[(1)(1) - (3)(-3)] = -[1 + 9] = -10

k: (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4

Yes, that's correct. Then the magnitude squared is 8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2 = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. So, sqrt(180) is indeed 6√5. Therefore, half of that is 3√5.

I think that's the correct area. Let me just visualize the triangle to make sure. Points O, A, and B are in 3D space, but the area can still be found using the cross product method because it's a planar triangle. So, yeah, I think 3√5 is the right answer.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) given the vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, we compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating each component:

- The \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- The \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( - (1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = - (1 + 9) = -10 \)
- The \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a complex number \( z \) such that

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

And I need to find

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}.
\]

Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expressions like \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since \( z \) is a complex number, it might be helpful to express it in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number can be written as \( z = e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). If I do that, then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), so

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta.
\]

So, in this case, we have

\[
2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Let me solve for \( \cos\theta \):

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \), then yes, that's correct. So,

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Hmm, okay. So \( \theta \) is the angle whose cosine is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). I wonder if this relates to a known angle or if it's a special angle. Let me compute the numerical value to get a sense.

Calculating \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \):

First, \( \sqrt{5} \) is approximately 2.236, so \( 1 + \sqrt{5} \) is about 3.236. Dividing by 4 gives approximately 0.809. So, \( \cos\theta \approx 0.809 \). Hmm, that's close to \( \cos(36^\circ) \) because \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is about 0.8090. Let me confirm:

Yes, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, let me compute \( \cos(36^\circ) \):

Using the exact value, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute it properly.

Wait, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \):

That would be \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), which is approximately \( \frac{2.236 + 1}{2} = \frac{3.236}{2} = 1.618 \). Wait, that can't be, because cosine can't be more than 1. So, I must have messed up.

Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, let me recall that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps I should recall that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Hmm, maybe I'm overcomplicating.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to note that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is approximately 0.809, which is indeed \( \cos(36^\circ) \). So, \( \theta = 36^\circ \) or \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) radians. Let me confirm:

Yes, \( 36^\circ \) is \( \pi/5 \) radians, and \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, let me compute \( \cos(\pi/5) \):

Using exact value, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps I should just accept that \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, I'm getting confused.

Let me look it up in my mind: \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps it's better to just accept that \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, I think I'm stuck here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can just note that \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps I should just compute it numerically.

Wait, \( \pi/5 \) is approximately 0.628 radians, and \( \cos(0.628) \) is approximately 0.809, which matches our earlier calculation. So, yes, \( \theta = \pi/5 \) radians or 36 degrees.

So, if \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \). Therefore, \( z^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \). Wait, 85 divided by 5 is 17, so \( 85\pi/5 = 17\pi \). So, \( z^{85} = e^{i17\pi} \).

But \( e^{i17\pi} \) is the same as \( e^{i\pi} \) because \( e^{i\theta} \) is periodic with period \( 2\pi \). So, 17π is equal to 8*2π + π, so it's equivalent to π. Therefore, \( e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \).

Similarly, \( 1/z^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \).

Therefore, \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = (-1) + (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use De Moivre's theorem. Since \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^n = e^{in\pi/5} \). So, \( z^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \). As above, 17π is an odd multiple of π, so it's equal to π modulo 2π, so \( e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, \( 1/z^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \). So, adding them together gives -2.

Alternatively, maybe I can think in terms of powers of \( z + 1/z \). Let me recall that \( z^n + 1/z^n \) can be expressed in terms of Chebyshev polynomials or using recurrence relations.

Given that \( z + 1/z = c \), where \( c = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), then \( z^n + 1/z^n \) can be found using the recurrence relation:

\( a_n = c \cdot a_{n-1} - a_{n-2} \),

where \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = c \).

So, let's try that approach.

Given \( a_0 = 2 \), \( a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Then,

\( a_2 = c \cdot a_1 - a_0 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 \).

Let me compute that:

First, \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})^2}{4} = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, \( a_2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Hmm, okay. Then,

\( a_3 = c \cdot a_2 - a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Let me compute the first term:

\( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1)(-1) + (1)(\sqrt{5}) + (\sqrt{5})(-1) + (\sqrt{5})(\sqrt{5})}{4} \).

Simplify numerator:

-1 + √5 - √5 + 5 = (-1 + 5) + (√5 - √5) = 4 + 0 = 4.

So, the first term is \( \frac{4}{4} = 1 \).

Therefore, \( a_3 = 1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{2 - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Continuing,

\( a_4 = c \cdot a_3 - a_2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Compute the first term:

\( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 - 5}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \).

So, \( a_4 = -1 - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = -1 + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-2 + 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Next,

\( a_5 = c \cdot a_4 - a_3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Compute the first term:

\( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} - 5}{4} = \frac{-6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, \( a_5 = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5} - 1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} = -2 \).

Hmm, interesting. So, \( a_5 = -2 \).

Wait, that's the same as \( z^5 + 1/z^5 = -2 \). So, if I continue this pattern, perhaps there's a cycle every 5 terms?

Let me check \( a_6 \):

\( a_6 = c \cdot a_5 - a_4 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \cdot (-2) - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

Compute:

First term: \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times (-2) = -(1 + \sqrt{5}) \).

Second term: \( - \frac{-1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So,","[Eq(-1*(-sqrt(5) - 1)/2, (1 + sqrt(5))/2), '- \\frac{-1 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} = \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and the medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. Then, there's a line passing through G that's parallel to BC, and this line intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is given as 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, okay.

First, let me recall some properties of centroids and medians in triangles. The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1. That might come in handy.

Now, the line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. Since it's parallel to BC, I think this line MN is part of a smaller, similar triangle within ABC. Maybe triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC? Let me check.

If MN is parallel to BC, then by the Basic Proportionality Theorem (also known as Thales' theorem), the line MN divides sides AB and AC proportionally. So, AM/AB = AN/AC. But since MN passes through the centroid G, which divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, maybe I can find the ratio of similarity.

Wait, the centroid is located at 2/3 of the distance from each vertex along the median. So, if I consider the median from A to BC, which is AD, then AG is 2/3 of AD. Now, the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. So, the distance from A to MN is 2/3 the distance from A to BC. That would mean that the height of triangle AMN is 2/3 the height of triangle ABC.

But wait, if the height is 2/3, then the area would be (2/3)^2 = 4/9 of the original area. But hold on, is triangle AMN similar to ABC? Let me think. Since MN is parallel to BC, the corresponding angles are equal, so yes, they are similar. So, the ratio of areas would be the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

But wait, if the height is 2/3, then the ratio of similarity is 2/3, so the area ratio is (2/3)^2 = 4/9. So, the area of triangle AMN would be 4/9 of 144, which is 64. But wait, the problem is asking for the area of triangle ENG, not AMN. Hmm, so I need to figure out where points E and N are.

Point E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. So, E is the midpoint, meaning AE = EC. Similarly, point F is the midpoint of AB, but I don't know if that's relevant here. Point N is where the line through G parallel to BC intersects AC. So, N is somewhere on AC.

Wait, so triangle ENG is formed by points E, N, and G. Let me try to sketch this mentally. E is the midpoint of AC, N is a point on AC, and G is the centroid. So, triangle ENG is a smaller triangle within ABC.

Maybe I can find the coordinates of these points to calculate the area. Let me assign coordinates to triangle ABC to make it easier. Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates so that the midpoints will have integer coordinates, which might simplify calculations.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 0)
- B: (2b, 0)
- C: (2c, 2d)

Then, the midpoints:
- D is the midpoint of BC: ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)
- E is the midpoint of AC: ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)
- F is the midpoint of AB: ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)

The centroid G is the intersection of the medians, so its coordinates are the average of the vertices:
G = ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Now, the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. Let me find the equation of line MN. Since it's parallel to BC, it will have the same slope as BC.

First, let's find the slope of BC. Coordinates of B: (2b, 0), coordinates of C: (2c, 2d). So, slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b).

So, the line MN has slope d/(c - b). It passes through G, which is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3). So, the equation of MN is:

y - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Now, let's find points M and N where this line intersects AB and AC.

First, find point M on AB. AB is the line from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0), so it's the x-axis. So, y = 0 on AB. Let's plug y = 0 into the equation of MN:

0 - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify:

-2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:

-2d/3 * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Simplify:

-2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Multiply both sides by 3:

-2(c - b) = 3x - 2b - 2c

Expand left side:

-2c + 2b = 3x - 2b - 2c

Bring all terms to one side:

-2c + 2b + 2b + 2c = 3x

Simplify:

4b = 3x => x = (4b)/3

So, point M is at ((4b)/3, 0)

Similarly, find point N on AC. AC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). Let me parametrize AC. The parametric equations can be written as x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Now, plug this into the equation of MN:

y - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Substitute x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t:

2d*t - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify left side:

2d*t - (2d)/3 = (2d/3)(3t - 1)

Right side:

(d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3) = (d/(c - b))( (6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3 ) = (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

So, equation becomes:

(2d/3)(3t - 1) = (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:

2d(3t - 1) = (d/(c - b))(6c*t - 2b - 2c)

Divide both sides by d (assuming d ≠ 0):

2(3t - 1) = (1/(c - b))(6c*t - 2b - 2c)

Multiply both sides by (c - b):

2(3t - 1)(c - b) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Expand left side:

2*(3t*(c - b) - 1*(c - b)) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Which is:

6t*(c - b) - 2*(c - b) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Expand:

6c*t - 6b*t - 2c + 2b = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Subtract 6c*t from both sides:

-6b*t - 2c + 2b = -2b - 2c

Bring all terms to left side:

-6b*t - 2c + 2b + 2b + 2c = 0

Simplify:

-6b*t + 4b = 0

Factor:

-6b*t + 4b = 0 => b*(-6t + 4) = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0, then:

-6t + 4 = 0 => 6t = 4 => t = 4/6 = 2/3

So, t = 2/3. Therefore, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3)

So, coordinates of N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

Now, we have points E, N, and G.

Point E is the midpoint of AC: (c, d)

Point N is (4c/3, 4d/3)

Point G is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

So, let's write down their coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Now, to find the area of triangle ENG, we can use the shoelace formula.

First, let's list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Let me denote the coordinates as follows:

E: (x1, y1) = (c, d)

N: (x2, y2) = (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: (x3, y3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

The shoelace formula for area is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plugging in the values:

Area = |(c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3))/2|

Simplify each term step by step.

First term: c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2c d)/3

Second term: (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = (-4c d)/9

Third term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = (- (2b + 2c) d)/9

So, putting it all together:

Area = |( (2c d)/3 + (-4c d)/9 + (- (2b + 2c) d)/9 ) / 2 |

Let me combine the terms:

First, convert (2c d)/3 to ninths: (6c d)/9

So, 6c d /9 - 4c d /9 - (2b + 2c) d /9

Combine the numerators:

[6c d - 4c d - 2b d - 2c d] /9

Simplify numerator:

6c d - 4c d - 2c d = 0c d

So, numerator becomes: -2b d

Thus, Area = | ( -2b d /9 ) / 2 | = | (-2b d)/18 | = | (-b d)/9 | = (b d)/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is (b d)/9.

But wait, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC in terms of b, c, d?

Using coordinates, the area can be calculated via shoelace formula as well.

Coordinates of ABC:

A: (0, 0)

B: (2b, 0)

C: (2c, 2d)

Area = |(0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0))/2|

Simplify:

|0 + 4b d + 0| /2 = |4b d| /2 = 2b d

So, area of ABC is 2b d = 144 => b d = 72

Therefore, the area of triangle ENG is (b d)/9 = 72 /9 = 8

So, the area is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with coordinates, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, area of ABC: 2b d = 144 => b d = 72. Correct.

Area of ENG: (b d)/9 = 72/9 = 8. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ratio approach without coordinates.

Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through centroid G, which is 2/3 along the median from A. So, the ratio of similarity between AMN and ABC is 2/3, so area is (2/3)^2 * 144 = 64. Then, triangle ENG is a part of this.

But wait, E is the midpoint of AC, so in triangle AMN, point E is the midpoint of AC, but N is a point on AC. Wait, in triangle AMN, point N is 2/3 along AC from A, since t = 2/3 earlier","[2/3, '2/3']",8,"[8, '8']",False

  Inicialmente, havia 8 livros. Retirando 2, restam:  
  \( 8 - 2 = 6 \) livros.

- **Prateleira do meio (Matemática):**  
  Inicialmente, havia 10 livros. Retirando 2, restam:

"Primeiro, reconheço que estamos lidando com uma sequência aritmética, onde cada termo é obtido adicionando uma constante, chamada de razão (r), ao termo anterior.

Sabemos que o quarto termo (a₄) é 200 e o oitavo termo (a₈) é 500. Na fórmula da sequência aritmética, o n-ésimo termo é dado por aₙ = a₁ + (n - 1)r.

Assim, podemos montar as seguintes equações:
a₄ = a₁ + 3r = 200
a₈ = a₁ + 7r = 500

Subtraindo a primeira equação da segunda, eliminamos a₁:
(a₁ + 7r) - (a₁ + 3r) = 500 - 200
4r = 300
r = 75

Agora que encontramos a razão, podemos encontrar o sexto termo (a₆):
a₆ = a₁ + 5r

Para encontrar a₁, usamos a primeira equação:
a₁ + 3 * 75 = 200
a₁ = 200 - 225
a₁ = -25

Finalmente, calculamos a₆:
a₆ = -25 + 5 * 75 = -25 + 375 = 350

Vamos resolver o problema passo a passo.

**Dados:**
- O quarto termo de uma sequência aritmética é \(200\).
- O oitavo termo é \(500\).

**Objetivo:**
Encontrar o sexto termo da sequência.

**Passo 1: Entender a fórmula da sequência aritmética**

Em uma sequência aritmética, cada termo é obtido adicionando uma constante, chamada de **razão** (\(r\)), ao termo anterior. A fórmula para o \(n\)-ésimo termo (\(a_n\)) é:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)r
\]

onde:
- \(a_1\) é o primeiro termo,
- \(r\) é a razão,
- \(n\) é o número do termo.

**Passo 2: Escrever as equações com os termos fornecidos**

Sabemos que:
- O quarto termo (\(a_4\)) é \(200\):
  \[
  a_4 = a_1 + 3r = 200 \quad \text{(1)}
  \]
  
- O oitavo termo (\(a_8\)) é \(500\):
  \[
  a_8 = a_1 + 7r = 500 \quad \text{(2)}
  \]

**Passo 3: Resolver o sistema de equações para encontrar \(r\) e \(a_1\)**

Subtraindo a equação (1) da equação (2):

\[
(a_1 + 7r) - (a_1 + 3r) = 500 - 200
\]
\[
4r = 300
\]
\[
r = \frac{300}{4} = 75

Agora que encontramos a razão (\(r = 75\)), substituímos em uma das equações para encontrar \(a_1\). Usando a equação (1):

\[
a_1 + 3 \times 75 = 200
\]
\[
a_1 + 225 = 200
\]
\[
a_1 = 200 - 225 = -25

Observo que o denominador é uma multiplicação de potências de 2 e 5, o que indica que a fração pode ser convertida em um decimal finito.

Para facilitar a conversão, vou tornar o denominador uma potência de 10. Sabendo que \(10^n = 2^n \cdot 5^n\), preciso igualar os expoentes de 2 e 5 no denominador.

No denominador atual, temos \(2^2\) e \(5^7\). Para igualar os expoentes, multiplicarei o numerador e o denominador por \(2^5\), resultando em \(2^7\) no denominador.

Assim, a fração se torna \(\frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{10^7}\).

Calculando \(2^5\), obtenho 32. Multiplicando pelo numerador, 21 × 32 = 672.

"Okay, so I have this problem here: ""Para quantos inteiros positivos \( n > 1 \) é verdade que \( 2^{24} \) é uma potência perfeita de \( n^{\text{th}} \)?"" Hmm, let me try to understand what this is asking. It's in Portuguese, so translating it, it says, ""For how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) is it true that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power?"" 

Alright, so I need to find all integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power. That means I need to find all \( n \) where there exists some integer \( k \) such that \( k^n = 2^{24} \). 

Let me think about what it means for a number to be a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power. If \( k^n = 2^{24} \), then \( k \) must be a power of 2 as well because 2 is a prime number. So, let me express \( k \) as \( 2^m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer. Substituting that into the equation, we get:

\( (2^m)^n = 2^{24} \)

Simplifying the left side, we have:

\( 2^{m \cdot n} = 2^{24} \)

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore:

\( m \cdot n = 24 \)

So, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. But wait, \( n \) has to be greater than 1, so I need to find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

Let me list the positive divisors of 24. To do that, I can factorize 24 into its prime factors:

\( 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \)

The number of divisors is calculated by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying them. So, the number of divisors is \( (3 + 1) \times (1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 = 8 \). Therefore, there are 8 positive divisors of 24.

But since \( n > 1 \), I need to exclude 1 from this list. So, the number of valid \( n \) is 8 - 1 = 7.

Wait, let me double-check that. The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Yes, that's 8 divisors. Excluding 1, we have 7 divisors left. So, \( n \) can be 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24.

Let me verify each of these to make sure they satisfy the condition.

1. For \( n = 2 \): \( k^2 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{12} \), which is an integer. So, yes.
2. For \( n = 3 \): \( k^3 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{8} \), which is an integer. So, yes.
3. For \( n = 4 \): \( k^4 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{6} \), which is an integer. So, yes.
4. For \( n = 6 \): \( k^6 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{4} \), which is an integer. So, yes.
5. For \( n = 8 \): \( k^8 = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{3} \), which is an integer. So, yes.
6. For \( n = 12 \): \( k^{12} = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{2} \), which is an integer. So, yes.
7. For \( n = 24 \): \( k^{24} = 2^{24} \) implies \( k = 2^{1} \), which is an integer. So, yes.

All of these work, so there are indeed 7 values of \( n \) that satisfy the condition.

I think that's all. So, the answer should be 7.

**Final Answer**
The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) it is true that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, we need to find all \( n \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) where \( k^n = 2^{24} \).

Expressing \( k \) as \( 2^m \) (since \( k \) must be a power of 2), we get:
\[ (2^m)^n = 2^{24} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2^{m \cdot n} = 2^{24} \]
Thus, the exponents must be equal:
\[ m \cdot n = 24 \]

This means \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The prime factorization of 24 is:
\[ 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \]
The number of divisors is calculated as:
\[ (3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]
The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Excluding 1, we have 7 divisors left.

Each of these divisors \( n \) (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24) satisfies the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Primeiro, preciso entender o problema. Temos uma roda com números que, ao ser girada duas vezes, determina aleatoriamente dois números. O primeiro número é dividido por 4, resultando em um resto que define a coluna (1, 2 ou 3). O segundo número é dividido por 5, resultando em um resto que define a linha (1, 2, 3 ou 4).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of sines at various angles: sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, and sin160°. That's eight sine terms multiplied together. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to simplify this.

First, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities. But with eight terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that products of sines at equally spaced angles can sometimes be expressed in terms of multiple angles or using complex numbers. Let me think about that.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. These angles are all multiples of 20°, right? So, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. That's 20° times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, it's like 20° times k, where k goes from 1 to 8. So, maybe I can write this product as the product of sin(20°k) for k from 1 to 8.

Wait, but 20° times 8 is 160°, which is less than 180°, so all these angles are in the first or second quadrant, where sine is positive. So, all the terms in the product are positive, which is good to know.

I also remember that there's a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles. Specifically, for angles that are in arithmetic progression. Let me recall that formula. I think it's something like the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1 is equal to n/(2^{n-1}). But wait, that's for angles in radians and specific cases. Let me check if that applies here.

Wait, in our case, the angles are in degrees, but maybe I can convert them to radians to see if it fits. 20° is π/9 radians, right? Because 180° is π radians, so 20° is π/9. So, 20°, 40°, ..., 160° correspond to π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9. So, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) ... sin(8π/9). Hmm, that seems similar to the formula I was thinking of.

Wait, the formula I remember is for the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1, which equals n/(2^{n-1}). But in our case, the angles are kπ/9 for k from 1 to 8. So, n would be 9? Let me see. If n=9, then the product of sin(kπ/(2*9)) for k=1 to 8 would be 9/(2^8). But wait, in our case, the angles are kπ/9, not kπ/(2*9). So, that might not directly apply.

Alternatively, maybe there's another formula. I think there's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(π/(2n)) sin(2π/(2n)) ... sin((n-1)π/(2n)) which equals n/(2^{n-1}). But again, in our case, the angles are different.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe I can pair the terms in the product. Since sine has the property that sin(180° - x) = sinx. So, sin160° = sin20°, sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, sin100° = sin80°. So, that means sin160° sin140° sin120° sin100° = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. So, the original product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.

So, if I can compute the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, then square it, I'll have the answer. That reduces the problem to computing a product of four terms instead of eight.

So, let me focus on computing P = sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. Maybe I can compute this product first.

I remember that sinA sinB can be expressed using product-to-sum identities. The identity is sinA sinB = [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)] / 2. Maybe I can apply this identity step by step.

Let me pair sin20° and sin80°, and sin40° and sin60°. So, first compute sin20° sin80°, then compute sin40° sin60°, and then multiply the two results together.

Compute sin20° sin80°:

Using the identity: [cos(20° - 80°) - cos(20° + 80°)] / 2 = [cos(-60°) - cos(100°)] / 2. Since cosine is even, cos(-60°) = cos60°, so this becomes [cos60° - cos100°]/2.

Similarly, compute sin40° sin60°:

Again, using the identity: [cos(40° - 60°) - cos(40° + 60°)] / 2 = [cos(-20°) - cos100°]/2 = [cos20° - cos100°]/2.

So now, P = [ (cos60° - cos100°)/2 ] * [ (cos20° - cos100°)/2 ].

So, P = [ (cos60° - cos100°)(cos20° - cos100°) ] / 4.

Let me compute the numerator: (cos60° - cos100°)(cos20° - cos100°).

Let me expand this:

= cos60° cos20° - cos60° cos100° - cos100° cos20° + cos100° cos100°

So, four terms. Let me compute each term:

1. cos60° cos20°: I know cos60° is 0.5, so this is 0.5 cos20°.

2. -cos60° cos100°: Again, cos60° is 0.5, so this is -0.5 cos100°.

3. -cos100° cos20°: This is -cos100° cos20°.

4. cos100° cos100°: This is cos²100°.

So, putting it all together:

0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos100° - cos100° cos20° + cos²100°.

Hmm, this seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it further.

Let me see if I can combine terms or use other identities. For example, cos²100° can be written as (1 + cos200°)/2 using the double-angle identity.

Similarly, cos100° cos20° can be expressed using the product-to-sum identity: cosA cosB = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2.

So, let's rewrite each term:

1. 0.5 cos20° remains as is.

2. -0.5 cos100° remains as is.

3. -cos100° cos20° = - [cos(120°) + cos(80°)] / 2.

4. cos²100° = (1 + cos200°)/2.

So, substituting back:

0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos100° - [cos120° + cos80°]/2 + (1 + cos200°)/2.

Let me compute each part:

First term: 0.5 cos20°.

Second term: -0.5 cos100°.

Third term: - [cos120° + cos80°]/2 = -0.5 cos120° - 0.5 cos80°.

Fourth term: (1 + cos200°)/2 = 0.5 + 0.5 cos200°.

So, combining all terms:

0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos100° - 0.5 cos120° - 0.5 cos80° + 0.5 + 0.5 cos200°.

Now, let's compute each cosine term:

cos20° is just cos20°, which is approximately 0.9397, but I'll keep it as cos20° for now.

cos100° is equal to -cos80°, since cos(180° - x) = -cosx. So, cos100° = -cos80°.

Similarly, cos120° is equal to -0.5, since cos(180° - 60°) = -cos60° = -0.5.

cos200° is equal to -cos20°, since cos(180° + 20°) = -cos20°.

So, substituting these:

0.5 cos20° - 0.5 (-cos80°) - 0.5 (-0.5) - 0.5 cos80° + 0.5 + 0.5 (-cos20°).

Simplify each term:

1. 0.5 cos20°.

2. -0.5 (-cos80°) = 0.5 cos80°.

3. -0.5 (-0.5) = 0.25.

4. -0.5 cos80°.

5. 0.5.

6. 0.5 (-cos20°) = -0.5 cos20°.

Now, let's combine like terms:

cos20° terms: 0.5 cos20° - 0.5 cos20° = 0.

cos80° terms: 0.5 cos80° - 0.5 cos80° = 0.

Constant terms: 0.25 + 0.5 = 0.75.

So, the entire numerator simplifies to 0.75.

Therefore, P = 0.75 / 4 = 0.1875.

Wait, 0.75 divided by 4 is 0.1875, which is 3/16.

So, P = 3/16.

But wait, P was the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, which we found to be 3/16.

Therefore, the original product is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 = (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 0.75 divided by 4 is indeed 0.1875, which is 3/16. So, P = 3/16, and then squaring that gives 9/256.

But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with multiple identities, it's easy to make a mistake.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another approach to compute P.

I remember that for multiple sine products, sometimes using complex numbers or roots of unity can help. Let me think about that.

The product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° can be related to the roots of the equation sin(9θ) = 0, since 9θ = 180°, so θ = 20°, 40°, ..., 160°, which are the angles we have.

Wait, actually, sin(9θ) = 0 when θ = 20°, 40°, ..., 160°, which are the angles in our original product. So, maybe I can use the identity for sin(9θ) in terms of sinθ.

I recall that sin(nθ) can be expressed as a polynomial in sinθ. For n=9, it's a bit complicated, but maybe I can use the formula for sin(9θ) in terms of sinθ.

Alternatively, I remember that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). But in our case, the angles are in degrees, but let's see.

Wait, if I consider θ = 20°, which is π/9 radians. So, the product sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) ... sin(8π/9). That's exactly the product we have, except in radians.

So, according to the formula, the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). So, for n=9, the product would be 9/(2^8) = 9/256.

Wait, that's exactly the result we got earlier! So, that confirms that the product is 9/256.

But wait, in our case, the product is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°, which is the same as sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) ... sin(8π/9). So, according to the formula, that product is 9/(2^8) = 9/256.

Therefore, the answer is 9/256.

But just to make sure, let me think again. The formula says that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(","[9/256.0, '9/256.\n']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out what shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates. The options are Line, Circle, Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, or Cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane, just like in Cartesian coordinates. So, the equation \( z = c \) is setting the height to a constant value.

In Cartesian coordinates, if I have \( z = c \), that's a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But wait, in cylindrical coordinates, does this equation represent the same thing? I think it does because \( z \) is the same in both systems. So, regardless of \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is fixed, every point with that \( z \) value lies on the same plane.

Let me visualize this. If I fix \( z = c \), then for any \( r \) and any angle \( \theta \), the point \( (r, \theta, c) \) will lie on the plane that's parallel to the xy-plane and at a height \( c \). So, it's not a line because a line would require two coordinates to vary or something. It's not a circle because a circle would have a fixed \( r \) and varying \( \theta \), but here \( r \) can vary. It's not a sphere because a sphere would involve all three coordinates in a squared equation. It's not a cylinder because a cylinder usually has a fixed \( r \) or something like that. And it's not a cone because a cone would have a relationship between \( r \) and \( z \), like \( z = kr \) or something.

So, yeah, it must be a plane. The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates is a plane. Therefore, the correct answer should be (C) Plano.

Wait, just to make sure, let me recall the standard forms. In cylindrical coordinates, a plane parallel to the xy-plane is indeed \( z = c \). A cylinder would be something like \( r = c \), which is a vertical cylinder. A cone would be \( z = kr \), which is a cone opening upwards. A sphere would involve \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \) or something like that. So, yeah, I'm confident it's a plane.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is (3, 2, 6). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors has a magnitude equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can solve for sin(theta) and then find theta.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector (3, 2, 6). The magnitude is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 is 13, plus 36 is 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49), which is 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.

Now, plugging into the formula: 7 = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta). We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so 7 = 2 * 7 * sin(theta). Let me compute 2 * 7, that's 14. So 7 = 14 sin(theta). Dividing both sides by 14, I get sin(theta) = 7 / 14, which simplifies to 1/2.

So sin(theta) is 1/2. Now, I need to find the angle theta where sine is 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) is 1/2, and sin(150°) is also 1/2. But since we're looking for the smallest angle between the vectors, it should be the acute angle, which is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check. The cross product magnitude gives us the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors, and the sine of the angle relates to the ""height"" of that parallelogram. Since sine is positive in both the first and second quadrants, the angle could be acute or obtuse. But the smallest angle between two vectors is always the acute one, so 30 degrees makes sense.

Is there anything else I need to consider? Maybe the direction of the cross product? But since the problem only asks for the angle, not the orientation, I think 30 degrees is the answer.

Just to recap: ||a × b|| = 7, which equals ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta). Plugging in the magnitudes, we get sin(theta) = 1/2, leading to theta = 30°. Yep, that seems right.

**Final Answer**
The smallest angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)
\]
we substitute the known values:
\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin(\theta)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin(\theta) \implies \sin(\theta) = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we need the smallest angle, we choose \(30^\circ\).

Thus, the smallest angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the roots of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The function f(x) is given as f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for any polynomial function, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial like f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, for f(x), the sum of the roots would be -(-49)/1, which is 49. But wait, the question is about g(x), not f(x). So, I need to figure out how shifting the function affects the roots and their sum.

The function g(x) is defined as f(x + 5). That means it's a horizontal shift of f(x) to the left by 5 units. So, if f(x) has roots at certain points, g(x) will have roots shifted to the left by 5 as well. Let me denote the roots of f(x) as r₁, r₂, and r₃. Then, the roots of g(x) would be r₁ - 5, r₂ - 5, and r₃ - 5 because g(x) = f(x + 5) implies that when x + 5 = r, then x = r - 5 is a root of g(x).

So, if the original roots of f(x) are r₁, r₂, r₃, the roots of g(x) are each 5 less than the roots of f(x). Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r₁ - 5) + (r₂ - 5) + (r₃ - 5) = (r₁ + r₂ + r₃) - 15. 

From earlier, I found that the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49. So, substituting that in, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be 49 - 15, which is 34. 

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. Is shifting the function left by 5 units equivalent to subtracting 5 from each root? Yes, because if you replace x with x + 5 in f(x), you're effectively shifting the graph left, so each root is moved 5 units to the left, which is subtracting 5 from each root. So, the sum of the roots would decrease by 15 in total.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this by expanding g(x) and then using Vieta's formula on g(x) directly. Let me try that to verify.

Given that g(x) = f(x + 5), so let's substitute x + 5 into f(x):

g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let me expand each term step by step.

First, expand (x + 5)³:
(x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, expand -49(x + 5)²:
(x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25, so multiplying by -49 gives:
-49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, expand 623(x + 5):
623x + 3115.

And the constant term is -2015.

Now, let's combine all these terms:

g(x) = (x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.

Now, let's combine like terms.

Starting with the x³ term: x³.

For x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².

For x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 is 208. So, 208x.

For the constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, so g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. So, in standard form, it's x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0.

Now, using Vieta's formula for the sum of roots, which is -b/a, where a is the coefficient of x³ and b is the coefficient of x². Here, a = 1 and b = -34. So, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. 

That's the same result as before. So, that confirms it. The sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that shifting the polynomial horizontally doesn't change the sum of the roots in a straightforward way, but in this case, since we're shifting each root by a constant, the sum changes by 3 times that constant. Since each root is shifted left by 5, the total sum decreases by 15, which is 3*5. So, 49 - 15 = 34.

Just to make sure, let me think if there's another perspective. Maybe using calculus? Probably not necessary, but just to see.

If I take the derivative of f(x), f'(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623. The critical points of f(x) would be where f'(x) = 0, but I don't think that's relevant here. The problem is about the roots, not the critical points.

Alternatively, maybe using the relationship between f(x) and g(x). Since g(x) = f(x + 5), then the roots of g(x) are the solutions to f(x + 5) = 0, which is equivalent to f(y) = 0 where y = x + 5. So, if y = r is a root of f(y), then x = y - 5 is a root of g(x). So, each root of g(x) is 5 less than a root of f(x). Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is the sum of the roots of f(x) minus 3*5, which is 15. So, 49 - 15 = 34.

Yes, that's consistent with what I found earlier.

I think I've approached this problem from a few different angles: directly using Vieta's formula on f(x) and then adjusting for the shift, expanding g(x) and then applying Vieta's formula, and also thinking about the relationship between the roots of f(x) and g(x). All methods lead me to the same answer, 34. So, I feel confident that this is the correct sum of the roots of g(x).

**Final Answer**
The sum of the roots of \( g \) is \boxed{34}.
</think>

To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we can use Vieta's formulas and the properties of polynomial shifts.

1. **Sum of roots of \( f(x) \)**:
   - For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots is given by Vieta's formula as \( \frac{-b}{a} \), where \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \).
   - Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is \( 49 \).

2. **Effect of shifting the polynomial**:
   - The function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. This means each root of \( f(x) \) is shifted left by 5 units.
   - If the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

3. **Sum of the roots of \( g(x) \)**:
   - The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \( (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 \).
   - Substituting the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \), we get \( 49 - 15 = 34 \).

4. **Verification by expanding \( g(x) \)**:
   - Expanding \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) results in \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \).
   - Using Vieta's formula on \( g(x) \), the sum of the roots is \( \frac{-b}{a} = \frac{34}{1} = 34 \).

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: calculate the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that trigonometric identities often help simplify expressions like this. Let me recall some identities that might be useful here. I know that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can express everything in terms of sine or cosine only. Alternatively, I remember that \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\) and \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\). Let me try that:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Wait, that simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should look for another approach. I remember that sometimes, when dealing with angles that are multiples of each other, like 10°, 20°, 40°, which are all multiples of 10°, there might be some identity or relationship that connects them.

Let me think about the angles: 10°, 20°, 40°. These angles are related through doubling: 10°, 20° is double 10°, and 40° is double 20°. Maybe I can use double-angle identities here.

I know that \(\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\), so maybe I can express \(\sin 20^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\). Let me try that.

First, let's express \(\sin 20^\circ\):

\[
\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ
\]

Similarly, \(\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). But \(\sin 20^\circ\) is already expressed in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\), so substituting that in:

\[
\sin 40^\circ = 2 \times 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \times \cos 20^\circ = 4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ
\]

Hmm, that might be useful later. Let me see if I can express all the terms in the original expression in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\).

Starting with the first term: \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\). That's straightforward, it's just \(\sec^2 10^\circ\).

The second term is \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}\). Since \(\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ\), then:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{(2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}
\]

Similarly, the third term is \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). From earlier, \(\sin 40^\circ = 4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{(4 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2} = \frac{1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

Hmm, so now the entire expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor out some common terms. Let's see:

First, notice that all terms have a \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\) factor. Let me factor that out:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} \left(1 + \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{16 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}\right)
\]

Hmm, that might not be the most helpful. Maybe I should instead look for another identity or perhaps consider using complementary angles or something else.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, expressions involving multiple angles can be tackled using the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\) or \(\cos 3\theta\). Let me recall those:

\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]
\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta
\]

But I'm not sure if that directly helps here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\sin^2 \theta\) in terms of \(\cos 2\theta\):

\[
\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2}
\]
\[
\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2}
\]

So, maybe I can express each term in the original expression using these identities.

Starting with the first term:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}
\]

Second term:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ}
\]

Third term:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

So, substituting these back into the original expression:

\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me write that as:

\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 80^\circ} \right)
\]

Now, I wonder if I can combine these fractions or find a common denominator. Alternatively, maybe I can use some other identities to simplify each term.

I remember that \(\frac{1}{1 + \cos \theta} = \frac{1 - \cos \theta}{\sin^2 \theta}\), but I'm not sure if that helps here. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for \(\cos 3\theta\) or something similar.

Wait, another idea: maybe express each denominator in terms of sine or cosine of complementary angles. For example, \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 10^\circ\), since \(\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta\). Similarly, \(\cos 40^\circ = \sin 50^\circ\), and \(\cos 20^\circ = \sin 70^\circ\). Let me try that.

So, substituting:

\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \sin 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \sin 50^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \sin 10^\circ} \right)
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe I can rationalize the denominators or find a way to combine these terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\cos A + \cos B\) or something similar, but I don't see an immediate connection.

Wait, another thought: maybe using the identity for \(\cos 3\theta\). Let me recall that:

\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta
\]

If I set \(\theta = 10^\circ\), then:

\[
\cos 30^\circ = 4 \cos^3 10^\circ - 3 \cos 10^\circ
\]

We know that \(\cos 30^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 4 \cos^3 10^\circ - 3 \cos 10^\circ
\]

Let me write that as:

\[
4 \cos^3 10^\circ - 3 \cos 10^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can solve for \(\cos 10^\circ\) or something. Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for \(\cos 20^\circ\) and \(\cos 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\cos 10^\circ\).

Wait, another idea: maybe using multiple-angle identities to express \(\cos 20^\circ\) and \(\cos 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\cos 10^\circ\). Let me try that.

We know that:

\[
\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1
\]
\[
\cos 40^\circ = 2 \cos^2 20^\circ - 1 = 2(2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1)^2 - 1
\]

Let me compute \(\cos 40^\circ\):

First, compute \(\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1\). Let me denote \(x = \cos 10^\circ\), so \(\cos 20^\circ = 2x^2 - 1\). Then,

\[
\cos 40^\circ = 2(2x^2 - 1)^2 - 1 = 2(4x^4 - 4x^2 + 1) - 1 = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 2 - 1 = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1
\]

So, \(\cos 40^\circ = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1\), where \(x = \cos 10^\circ\).

Similarly, \(\cos 80^\circ = 2 \cos^2 40^\circ - 1\). Let me compute that:

\[
\cos 80^\circ = 2(8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1)^2 - 1
\]

Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe I can compute it step by step.

First, compute \((8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1)^2\):

Let me denote \(y = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1\), so \(y^2 = (8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1)^2\). Expanding this:

\[
y^2 = (8x^4)^2 + (-8x^2)^2 + (1)^2 + 2 \times 8x^4 \times (-8x^2) + 2 \times 8x^4 \times 1 + 2 \times (-8x^2) \times 1
\]
\[
= 64x^8 + 64x^4 + 1 - 128x^6 + 16x^4 - 16x^2
\]
\[
= 64x^8 - 128x^6 + (64x^4 + 16x^4) + (-16x^2) + 1
\]
\[
= 64x^8 - 128x^6 + 80x^4 - 16x^2 + 1
\]

So, \(\cos 80^\circ = 2y^2 - 1 = 2(64x^8 - 128x^6 + 80x^4 - 16x^2 + 1) - 1\):

\[
= 128x^8 - 256x^6 + 160x^4 - 32x^2 + 2 - 1
\]
\[
= 128x^8 - 256x^6 + 160x^4 - 32x^2 + 1
\]

Wow, that's a high-degree polynomial. I'm not sure if this is helpful, but maybe I can use it somehow.

Wait, going back to the expression I had earlier:

"Primeiro, lembro que a soma dos ângulos internos de um polígono convexo com \( n \) lados é dada pela fórmula \( (n - 2) \times 180^\circ \).

No problema, a soma de todos os ângulos internos, exceto um, é \( 1070^\circ \). Isso significa que a soma total dos ângulos internos é \( 1070^\circ \) mais o valor do ângulo que está faltando.

Sabendo que um polígono convexo tem todos os seus ângulos internos menores que \( 180^\circ \), o ângulo faltante deve ser menor que \( 180^\circ \). Portanto, a soma total dos ângulos internos está entre \( 1070^\circ \) e \( 1250^\circ \) (pois \( 1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ \)).

Agora, calculo a soma total dos ângulos internos para diferentes valores de \( n \):

- Para \( n = 7 \): \( (7 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ \) (menor que \( 1070^\circ \))
- Para \( n = 8 \): \( (8 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ \) (dentro do intervalo)
- Para \( n = 9 \): \( (9 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ \) (maior que \( 1250^\circ \))

Assim, o valor de \( n \) que satisfaz a condição é \( 8 \), pois a soma total dos ângulos internos é \( 1080^\circ \), e \( 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ \), que é menor que \( 180^\circ \).
</think>

Para determinar quantos lados tem um polígono convexo cuja soma de todos os ângulos internos, exceto um, é \(1070^\circ\), siga os seguintes passos:

1. **Fórmula da Soma dos Ângulos Internos:**
   
   A soma dos ângulos internos de um polígono convexo com \( n \) lados é dada por:
   \[
   S = (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Relacionando com o Ângulo Faltante:**
   
   Se a soma de todos os ângulos internos, exceto um, é \(1070^\circ\), então a soma total dos ângulos internos é:
   \[
   S = 1070^\circ + \text{ângulo faltante}
   \]
   
   Como o polígono é convexo, cada ângulo interno é menor que \(180^\circ\). Portanto, o ângulo faltante \( \alpha \) satisfaz:
   \[
   0^\circ < \alpha < 180^\circ
   \]
   
3. **Determinando \( n \):**
   
   Sabemos que:
   \[
   (n - 2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + \alpha
   \]
   
   Como \( \alpha < 180^\circ \), temos:
   \[
   (n - 2) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ
   \]
   
   Portanto:
   \[
   (n - 2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   
   Dividindo ambos os lados por \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n - 2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 6.944
   \]
   
   Assim:
   \[
   n < 8.944
   \]
   
   Como \( n \) deve ser um número inteiro, os possíveis valores são \( n = 7 \) ou \( n = 8 \).

4. **Verificando os Valores:**
   
   - **Para \( n = 7 \):**
     \[
     S = (7 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
     \]
     Isso é menor que \(1070^\circ\), o que não é possível.
   
   - **Para \( n = 8 \):**
     \[
     S = (8 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
     \]
     Neste caso:
     \[
     \alpha = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
     \]
     Como \( 0^\circ < 10^\circ < 180^\circ \), este valor é válido.

3. **Completação do Quadrado:**
   
   Adicione 1 a ambos os lados para completar o quadrado:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t + 1 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}

   Isso simplifica para:
   \[

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is \(x\). Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the inverse cotangent function, giving me an angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\). 

Wait, I also recall that \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) for positive \(y\). So, if I let \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Is that right? Let me check. If \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Yeah, that seems correct. So, that means \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\).

So, substituting that back into the original equation, the argument inside the sine function becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x)\), which is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the equation simplifies to \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\).

Alright, so now I have \(\sin(2 \theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). I remember the double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\). So, substituting that in, I get \(2 \sin\theta \cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}\).

But I need to express this in terms of \(x\). Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), I can think of a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Substituting these into the equation, I get:
\[2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\]
So, that's:
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\]

Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)\]
Which simplifies to:
\[6x = x^2 + 1\]
Bringing all terms to one side:
\[x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). I can use the quadratic formula to solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]
Plugging in the values:
\[x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
Calculating the discriminant:
\[\sqrt{36 - 4} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\]
So, the solutions are:
\[x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:
\[x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\]

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, starting from the beginning, I used the identity that \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Is that always true? Let me think. The range of \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is \((-\pi/2, \pi/2)\), and the range of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is \((0, \pi)\). So, if \(x\) is positive, then \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is in \((0, \pi/2)\), which is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). But if \(x\) is negative, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is negative, while \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) would be in \((\pi/2, \pi)\). So, does the identity hold for negative \(x\)?

Hmm, that's a good point. Let me test with a positive \(x\) first. Let's say \(x = 1\). Then \(\tan^{-1}(1) = \pi/4\), and \(\cot^{-1}(1) = \pi/4\). So, that works. What about \(x = 2\)? \(\tan^{-1}(2)\) is some angle in the first quadrant, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/2)\) is the same angle. So, that seems to hold.

But what if \(x\) is negative? Let's say \(x = -1\). Then \(\tan^{-1}(-1) = -\pi/4\), and \(\cot^{-1}(-1)\) is... Wait, \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is defined for all real numbers except zero, but its range is \((0, \pi)\). So, \(\cot^{-1}(-1)\) would be in the second quadrant, specifically \(3\pi/4\). But \(\tan^{-1}(-1) = -\pi/4\), which is not equal to \(3\pi/4\). So, in that case, the identity doesn't hold.

Therefore, the identity \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(x)\) only holds when \(x > 0\). If \(x < 0\), then \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is equal to \(\pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\), because \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) for negative \(y\) is in the second quadrant, whereas \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) for negative \(x\) is in the fourth quadrant. So, to adjust for that, we have to add \(\pi\) to make it land in the second quadrant.

So, in the original equation, if \(x\) is negative, then \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\). Therefore, the argument inside the sine function becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \pi + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi\). So, the equation becomes \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi) = \frac{1}{3}\).

But \(\sin(\theta + \pi) = -\sin\theta\), so this simplifies to \(-\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\), which means \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = -\frac{1}{3}\).

Wait, so depending on whether \(x\) is positive or negative, the equation changes. So, I need to consider two cases: \(x > 0\) and \(x < 0\).

Case 1: \(x > 0\). Then, as before, the equation is \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). We solved this and got \(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\). But since \(x > 0\), both solutions are positive because \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is positive and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately \(3 - 2.828 = 0.172\), which is also positive. So, both solutions are valid in this case.

Case 2: \(x < 0\). Then, the equation becomes \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi) = \frac{1}{3}\), which simplifies to \(-\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\), so \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = -\frac{1}{3}\).

Let me solve this equation. Again, let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so \(\sin(2\theta) = -\frac{1}{3}\). Using the double-angle identity, \(2 \sin\theta \cos\theta = -\frac{1}{3}\).

Again, since \(x < 0\), \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) is in the fourth quadrant, so \(\sin\theta\) is negative and \(\cos\theta\) is positive. So, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) is negative, and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) is positive.

So, substituting:
\[2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = -\frac{1}{3}\]
Simplify:
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = -\frac{1}{3}\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[2x \cdot 3 = -1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)\]
Which gives:
\[6x = -x^2 - 1\]
Bringing all terms to one side:
\[x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0\]
Again, using the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\]

So, the solutions are \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Now, let's check if these are negative. \(2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 2.828, so:

- \(x = -3 + 2.828 \approx -0.172\), which is negative.
- \(x = -3 - 2.828 \approx -5.828\), which is also negative.

So, both solutions are valid for \(x < 0\).

Therefore, combining both cases, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Wait, hold on. Let me verify if all these solutions satisfy the original equation. Sometimes, when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, extraneous solutions can pop up because of the restricted ranges.

Let me test \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). First, compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Since \(x\) is positive, it's in the first quadrant. Then, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is also in the first quadrant. Adding them together, the angle inside sine is in the first or second quadrant. The sine of that angle is 1/3, which is positive, so that makes sense.

Similarly, \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 0.172, which is positive. So, same reasoning applies.

For \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), which is approximately -0.172, negative. So, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is in the fourth quadrant, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is in the second quadrant. Adding them together, the angle is in the second quadrant, and the sine of that angle is 1/3, which is positive. But wait, in the case of \(x < 0\), we had \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi) = \frac{1}{3}\), which simplifies to \(-\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\), so \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = -\frac{1}{3}\). So, the sine of an angle in the fourth quadrant is negative, which matches.

Similarly, \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately -5.828, which is negative. So, same reasoning applies.

Therefore, all four solutions seem valid.

Wait, but let me check if \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is indeed a solution. Let me compute \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(1/x)\). Since \(x\) is negative, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is negative, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is in the second quadrant. So, adding them together, the total angle is in the second quadrant. The sine of that angle is 1/3, which is positive, so that works.

Similarly, for \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), the angle inside sine is in the second quadrant, and sine is positive, so that works too.

Therefore, all four solutions are valid.

Wait, but hold on. Let me compute the numerical values to make sure.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. Both lines are given in parametric form, which is good because I remember that parametric equations are pretty straightforward for lines. Let me write them down again to make sure I have them right.

The first line is defined by the vector equation:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, this means that any point on the first line can be expressed as (3 + 2t, -10 - 9t, 1 - 2t).

The second line is defined by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Similarly, any point on the second line can be written as (-5 + 4u, -3 - 18u, 6 - 4u).

The problem states that these two lines are parallel. Hmm, I should verify that first because if they aren't parallel, the distance might not be straightforward. To check if they're parallel, I need to see if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Let me see if one is a multiple of the other.

Looking at the components:
- 4 is 2 times 2.
- -18 is 2 times -9.
- -4 is 2 times -2.

Yes, so the direction vector of the second line is exactly 2 times the direction vector of the first line. That means they are indeed parallel. Good, so the distance between them should be constant, and I can find it using the formula for the distance between two parallel lines.

I remember that the distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:
\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|}
\]
where \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the lines, and \(\vec{w}\) is the vector connecting any two points on the two lines.

Wait, let me make sure I have the formula right. I think it's the magnitude of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting the two points, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Yeah, that sounds right.

So, first, I need to find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Let's take the points when the parameters \(t\) and \(u\) are zero. That would be the points (3, -10, 1) and (-5, -3, 6). So, the vector connecting these two points is:
\[
\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Okay, so \(\vec{w}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, I need the direction vector \(\vec{v}\). Since both lines have the same direction vector (up to a scalar multiple), I can use either one. Let's use the direction vector from the first line: \(\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

Now, I need to compute the cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\). Let me recall how to compute a cross product. For vectors \(\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} w_1 \\ w_2 \\ w_3 \end{pmatrix}\), the cross product is:
\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 \\ v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 \\ v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, plugging in the values from \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\):

First component: \(v_2 w_3 - v_3 w_2 = (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) = -45 + 14 = -31\)

Second component: \(v_3 w_1 - v_1 w_3 = (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6\)

Third component: \(v_1 w_2 - v_2 w_1 = (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) = 14 - 72 = -58\)

So, the cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\) is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude \(|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|\) is calculated as:
\[
\sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2}
\]
Calculating each term:
- \((-31)^2 = 961\)
- \(6^2 = 36\)
- \((-58)^2 = 3364\)

Adding them up: 961 + 36 = 997; 997 + 3364 = 4361

So, the magnitude is \(\sqrt{4361}\). Let me see if 4361 is a perfect square or if I can simplify it. Hmm, 66 squared is 4356, which is close. 66^2 = 4356, so 4361 is 66^2 + 5, which isn't a perfect square. So, I'll just leave it as \(\sqrt{4361}\) for now.

Next, I need the magnitude of the direction vector \(\vec{v}\). The direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so its magnitude is:
\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]
So, \(|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{89}\).

Now, plugging these into the distance formula:
\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}}
\]
I can simplify this by dividing the radicals:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}}
\]
Let me compute 4361 divided by 89. Let's see, 89 times 49 is 4361 because 89*50=4450, which is 89 more than 4361, so 4450 - 89 = 4361. So, 89*49=4361.

Therefore, \(\frac{4361}{89} = 49\), so:
\[
d = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]
Wait, that's nice! So, the distance between the two lines is 7 units.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I found the connecting vector between two points on the lines, computed the cross product with the direction vector, found its magnitude, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector, and simplified. It all checks out.

I think that's the correct answer. The distance is 7.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the two parallel lines is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first verify that the lines are parallel by checking if their direction vectors are scalar multiples. The direction vectors are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which are indeed scalar multiples (the second is 2 times the first).

Next, we find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Using the points when \(t = 0\) and \(u = 0\), we get the vector:
\[
\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We then compute the cross product of the direction vector \(\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the connecting vector \(\vec{w}\):
\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) \\ (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) \\ (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of this cross product is:
\[
|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\vec{v}\) is:
\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:
\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Thus, the distance between the two parallel lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to calculate the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) cross (3c + a). I'm given the cross products of a, b, and c with each other: a cross b, a cross c, and b cross c. Hmm, let me write those down to keep track.

First, let me note the given cross products:

- a × b = [6, -7, 3]
- a × c = [4, 7, 2]
- b × c = [1, -7, 18]

I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, cross product is distributive over vector addition, right? So I can expand this expression using the distributive property. Let me recall the formula for the cross product of two vectors:

(u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x

So applying this to (2b - a) × (3c + a), I can expand it as:

2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a

Wait, let me make sure I distribute correctly. It should be:

(2b) × (3c) + (2b) × a + (-a) × (3c) + (-a) × a

Yes, that's right. Now, let's compute each term step by step.

First term: 2b × 3c. Since scalar multiplication can be factored out, this is equal to (2*3)(b × c) = 6(b × c). I know b × c is given as [1, -7, 18], so multiplying by 6 gives [6, -42, 108].

Second term: 2b × a. Again, scalar multiplication can be factored out, so this is 2(b × a). But wait, cross product is anti-commutative, meaning b × a = - (a × b). So, 2(b × a) = 2*(-a × b) = -2(a × b). Since a × b is [6, -7, 3], multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6].

Third term: (-a) × 3c. Similarly, this is (-1)(a × 3c) = -3(a × c). a × c is given as [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6].

Fourth term: (-a) × a. Hmm, cross product of any vector with itself is zero, right? So (-a) × a = - (a × a) = -0 = 0. So this term is just the zero vector.

So now, let me write down all the terms:

1. 6(b × c) = [6, -42, 108]
2. -2(a × b) = [-12, 14, -6]
3. -3(a × c) = [-12, -21, -6]
4. 0

Now, I need to add these four vectors together. Let's add them component-wise.

First, let's add the x-components:

6 (from first term) + (-12) (second term) + (-12) (third term) + 0 (fourth term) = 6 - 12 - 12 = 6 - 24 = -18

Next, the y-components:

-42 (first term) + 14 (second term) + (-21) (third term) + 0 = -42 + 14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49

Then, the z-components:

108 (first term) + (-6) (second term) + (-6) (third term) + 0 = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96

So putting it all together, the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with the x-component:

6 (from 6(b × c)) -12 (from -2(a × b)) -12 (from -3(a × c)) = 6 -12 -12 = -18. That seems correct.

Y-component:

-42 (from 6(b × c)) +14 (from -2(a × b)) -21 (from -3(a × c)) = -42 +14 -21. Let's compute step by step: -42 +14 is -28, then -28 -21 is -49. Correct.

Z-component:

108 (from 6(b × c)) -6 (from -2(a × b)) -6 (from -3(a × c)) = 108 -6 -6 = 96. Correct.

So, the final result is [-18, -49, 96]. Hmm, let me just make sure I didn't mix up any signs.

Wait, in the second term, I had -2(a × b). a × b is [6, -7, 3], so multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6]. That's correct.

Third term: -3(a × c). a × c is [4,7,2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6]. Correct.

Adding all together:

First term: [6, -42, 108]

Second term: [-12, 14, -6]

Third term: [-12, -21, -6]

Fourth term: [0,0,0]

Adding x: 6 -12 -12 = -18

Y: -42 +14 -21 = -49

Z: 108 -6 -6 = 96

Yes, that seems consistent.

So, the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) is equal to the vector [-18, -49, 96].

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:

1. Expanded the cross product using distributive property.
2. Replaced each cross product with the given vectors, remembering to apply scalar multiplication and anti-commutativity where necessary.
3. Calculated each term.
4. Added the components together.
5. Double-checked each step for any possible errors.

Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that the result is correct.

**Final Answer**
The cross product is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

Given the cross products of vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we need to calculate \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

First, we expand the expression using the distributive property of the cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (-\mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We compute each term separately:

1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\).
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\).
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\).
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\).

Next, we add the resulting vectors component-wise:

- For the \(x\)-component: \(6 - 12 - 12 = -18\).
- For the \(y\)-component: \(-42 + 14 - 21 = -49\).
- For the \(z\)-component: \(108 - 6 - 6 = 96\).

Thus, the resulting vector is:

"Okay, so I have this trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. Hmm, trapezoid with two sides parallel. I remember that in a trapezoid, the two non-parallel sides are called legs, and the parallel sides are the bases. So, AD and BC are the bases here.

The problem says that AC is perpendicular to CD. So, the diagonal AC is perpendicular to the side CD. That must mean that triangle ACD is a right triangle because one of its angles is 90 degrees. That's useful because right triangles have some nice properties, like the Pythagorean theorem, which might come in handy later.

Also, AC bisects the angle BAD. So, the diagonal AC splits angle BAD into two equal angles. That tells me that triangle ABC might have some special properties, maybe isosceles or something? Wait, no, not necessarily. But angle bisector theorem might be useful here. The angle bisector theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the lengths of the segments that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into. Maybe I can apply that here.

The area of the trapezoid ABCD is given as 42. I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Since ABCD is a trapezoid, its area can be calculated using the formula: (1/2)*(sum of the two bases)*height. So, if I can find the lengths of the bases AD and BC, and the height, I can relate them to the area.

But wait, I don't know the lengths of any sides. Maybe I can assign variables to them. Let me denote AD as the longer base and BC as the shorter one, but I'm not sure yet. Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry to model this trapezoid.

Let me try setting up a coordinate system. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AC is perpendicular to CD, maybe I can assign coordinates to the other points based on this.

Let me denote point D as (d, 0) because AD is a base and I placed A at (0,0). Then, since AD is parallel to BC, point B must be somewhere above A, and point C must be somewhere above D. Let me denote point B as (0, b) and point C as (c, h), where h is the height of the trapezoid. Wait, but AC is perpendicular to CD, so the slope of AC times the slope of CD should be -1.

Let me write down the coordinates:

- A: (0,0)
- D: (d, 0)
- B: (0, b)
- C: (c, h)

Since AD is parallel to BC, the slope of AD is 0 (since it's along the x-axis), so the slope of BC must also be 0. That means the line BC is horizontal. So, point C must have the same y-coordinate as point B. Therefore, h = b. So, point C is (c, b).

Now, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(c, b). The slope of AC is (b - 0)/(c - 0) = b/c.

CD is the side from C(c, b) to D(d, 0). The slope of CD is (0 - b)/(d - c) = -b/(d - c).

Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes should be -1. So,

(b/c) * (-b/(d - c)) = -1

Simplify:

(-b²)/(c(d - c)) = -1

Multiply both sides by c(d - c):

-b² = -c(d - c)

Simplify the negatives:

b² = c(d - c)

So, b² = c*d - c²

That's one equation.

Next, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAD is the angle at point A between BA and AD. Since AC is the angle bisector, it divides angle BAD into two equal angles.

In coordinate terms, BA is the line from A(0,0) to B(0,b), which is along the y-axis. AD is the line from A(0,0) to D(d,0), which is along the x-axis. So, angle BAD is the angle between the positive y-axis and the positive x-axis, which is 90 degrees. Wait, that can't be right because if BA is along the y-axis and AD is along the x-axis, then angle BAD is 90 degrees. If AC bisects this angle, then AC makes a 45-degree angle with both BA and AD.

But in our coordinate system, AC goes from (0,0) to (c, b). So, the slope of AC is b/c, which should be tan(45°) if it's bisecting the 90-degree angle. But tan(45°) is 1, so b/c = 1, which implies b = c.

Wait, that's interesting. So, from the angle bisector, we get that b = c.

But earlier, we had from the perpendicularity condition:

b² = c*d - c²

But since b = c, substitute:

c² = c*d - c²

Bring all terms to one side:

c² + c² - c*d = 0

2c² - c*d = 0

Factor out c:

c(2c - d) = 0

So, either c = 0 or 2c - d = 0.

But c can't be 0 because then point C would coincide with point A, which isn't possible in a trapezoid. So, 2c - d = 0 => d = 2c.

So, d = 2c.

So, now we have d = 2c, and b = c.

So, let's summarize:

- A: (0,0)
- D: (2c, 0)
- B: (0, c)
- C: (c, c)

So, now, let's compute the area of the trapezoid ABCD.

The formula for the area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height.

AD is the length from A to D, which is 2c.

BC is the length from B to C. Since B is (0,c) and C is (c,c), the distance is sqrt((c - 0)^2 + (c - c)^2) = sqrt(c² + 0) = c.

Wait, but BC is a base, so it's parallel to AD. Since AD is along the x-axis, BC must also be horizontal. So, the length of BC is the horizontal distance between B and C, which is c - 0 = c.

Wait, but in our coordinate system, BC is from (0,c) to (c,c), so yes, length c.

AD is from (0,0) to (2c,0), so length 2c.

The height of the trapezoid is the vertical distance between the two bases, which is c (since the y-coordinate of BC is c and AD is at y=0).

So, area = (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height = (1/2)*(2c + c)*c = (1/2)*(3c)*c = (3/2)c².

But the area is given as 42, so:

(3/2)c² = 42

Multiply both sides by 2:

3c² = 84

Divide by 3:

c² = 28

So, c = sqrt(28) = 2*sqrt(7). But maybe we don't need the exact value of c yet.

Now, we need to find the area of triangle ACD.

Points A(0,0), C(c,c), D(2c,0).

We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given coordinates of its vertices.

The formula is:

Area = (1/2)| (x_A(y_C - y_D) + x_C(y_D - y_A) + x_D(y_A - y_C)) |

Plugging in the coordinates:

Area = (1/2)| 0*(c - 0) + c*(0 - 0) + 2c*(0 - c) |

Simplify:

= (1/2)| 0 + 0 + 2c*(-c) | = (1/2)| -2c² | = (1/2)(2c²) = c²

So, the area of triangle ACD is c².

But we found earlier that c² = 28, so the area is 28.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check.

Alternatively, since triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC and CD.

Wait, AC is from (0,0) to (c,c), so its length is sqrt(c² + c²) = c*sqrt(2).

CD is from (c,c) to (2c,0). The length is sqrt((2c - c)^2 + (0 - c)^2) = sqrt(c² + c²) = c*sqrt(2).

So, both legs are c*sqrt(2). So, area is (1/2)*(c*sqrt(2))*(c*sqrt(2)) = (1/2)*(2c²) = c², which is 28. Yep, same result.

So, the area of triangle ACD is 28.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle ACD is \boxed{28}.

Given a trapezoid \(ABCD\) where \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). The area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42. We need to find the area of triangle \(ACD\).

1. **Coordinate Setup**:
   - Place point \(A\) at \((0,0)\).
   - Point \(D\) is at \((d, 0)\).
   - Point \(B\) is at \((0, b)\).
   - Point \(C\) is at \((c, b)\) since \(BC\) is horizontal.

2. **Slopes and Perpendicularity**:
   - The slope of \(AC\) is \(\frac{b}{c}\).
   - The slope of \(CD\) is \(\frac{-b}{d - c}\).
   - Since \(AC \perp CD\), their slopes multiply to \(-1\):
     \[
     \left(\frac{b}{c}\right) \left(\frac{-b}{d - c}\right) = -1 \implies \frac{-b^2}{c(d - c)} = -1 \implies b^2 = c(d - c)
     \]

3. **Angle Bisector**:
   - Since \(AC\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), which is 90 degrees, \(AC\) makes a 45-degree angle with both \(BA\) and \(AD\). Thus, \(b = c\).

4. **Solving for \(d\)**:
   - Substituting \(b = c\) into \(b^2 = c(d - c)\):
     \[
     c^2 = c(d - c) \implies c^2 = cd - c^2 \implies 2c^2 = cd \implies d = 2c
     \]

5. **Area of Trapezoid**:
   - The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times (2c + c) \times c = \frac{3}{2}c^2 = 42

"Okay, so I have this problem where four points A, B, C, and D are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. I need to find the probability that the segments AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with points on a circle, the order in which they are placed can affect whether the chords intersect. So maybe I should think about the arrangement of these four points around the circle.

Since the points are chosen randomly, the circle is symmetric, so the specific positions don't matter, only their relative order. That makes me think that I can fix one point and consider the positions of the others relative to it. Let me fix point A somewhere on the circle. Then, the positions of B, C, and D will be determined relative to A.

Now, the key here is to figure out the conditions under which chords AB and CD intersect. I recall that two chords intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, if going around the circle, we encounter the points in the order A, C, B, D, or A, D, B, C, or any rotation of these orders. If the points are in such an order, the chords AB and CD will cross each other inside the circle.

So, to rephrase, for AB and CD to intersect, the points must alternate between the two chords. That is, one chord's endpoints are separated by the other chord's endpoints. If all four points are in a sequence like A, B, C, D, then the chords AB and CD won't intersect because they are on the same side of each other.

Given that, I need to calculate the probability that the four points are arranged in such an alternating order. Since the points are chosen independently and uniformly, all possible orderings are equally likely.

Let me think about how many possible orderings there are. Once I fix point A, the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 different orders around the circle. Each of these orders is equally probable because of the uniform distribution.

Now, out of these 6 possible orderings, how many result in the chords AB and CD intersecting? Let's list them:

1. A, B, C, D: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
2. A, B, D, C: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
3. A, C, B, D: Chords AB and CD intersect.
4. A, C, D, B: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
5. A, D, B, C: Chords AB and CD intersect.
6. A, D, C, B: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.

Wait, so out of the 6 possible orderings, only two result in intersecting chords: A, C, B, D and A, D, B, C. So that's 2 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/3.

But hold on, is this correct? Let me double-check. When I fix point A, the other three points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. For each arrangement, I check if the chords intersect. From the list above, only two arrangements result in intersection. So the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that once A is fixed, the positions of B, C, D are random. The chord AB will divide the circle into two arcs. For chord CD to intersect AB, points C and D must lie on different arcs created by AB. So, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is equal to the probability that they are separated by AB.

Since the circle is continuous and the points are chosen uniformly, the probability that C is on one side of AB is 1/2, and then the probability that D is on the other side is also 1/2. But wait, is that accurate?

Actually, once AB is fixed, the circle is divided into two arcs. The probability that point C is on one arc is proportional to the length of that arc. But since AB is a chord, the two arcs are of equal length only if AB is a diameter, which isn't necessarily the case here. Wait, no, actually, AB is just a chord, so the two arcs it creates can be of any length depending on where B is placed relative to A.

But since all points are chosen uniformly, the distribution of where B is placed relative to A is uniform. So, the length of the arc AB is uniformly distributed between 0 and the circumference. Hmm, this complicates things a bit.

Wait, maybe I should think differently. Instead of fixing A, perhaps I can consider all four points and their cyclic order. The probability that the four points are arranged in an order where AB and CD intersect is equal to the number of such arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements.

In a circle, the number of distinct cyclic orderings of four points is (4-1)! = 6, which is the same as linear orderings when considering rotations. But actually, for four distinct points on a circle, the number of distinct cyclic orderings is 3! = 6, since fixing one point, the others can be arranged in 3! ways.

Wait, so that's consistent with my earlier thought. So, out of these 6 cyclic orderings, how many result in intersecting chords? As before, two of them: A, C, B, D and A, D, B, C. So, 2 out of 6, which is 1/3.

But another approach: the probability that two chords intersect is equal to the probability that the four points are interleaved. That is, when listed in order around the circle, they alternate between the two chords.

So, for four points, the number of ways they can be interleaved is 2: either A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C. Since the total number of possible orderings is 6, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Alternatively, I've heard that the probability is 1/3, but I want to make sure I'm not missing something.

Wait, another way to think about it is to fix the positions of A and B. Then, the positions of C and D are random. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if C and D are on different sides of AB. So, once AB is fixed, the circle is divided into two arcs. The probability that C is on one arc and D is on the other is equal to 2 * (length of arc1 / circumference) * (length of arc2 / circumference). But since the arcs are determined by AB, which is random, the expected value of this probability is what we need.

But since AB is random, the lengths of the arcs are uniformly distributed. So, the expected value of (length1 * length2) is equal to the integral over all possible positions of B of (length1 * length2) divided by the total circumference squared.

Wait, this might be more complicated, but let's try.

Let’s denote the circumference as 1 for simplicity. Let’s fix point A at position 0. Then, point B is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The length of the arc from A to B is x, which is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Then, the length of the other arc is 1 - x.

The probability that C is on one arc and D is on the other is 2 * x * (1 - x). Because C can be on the first arc and D on the second, or vice versa.

So, the expected probability is the integral from x=0 to x=1 of 2x(1 - x) dx, multiplied by the probability density of x, which is 1 (since x is uniform).

So, the expected probability is ∫₀¹ 2x(1 - x) dx = 2 ∫₀¹ (x - x²) dx = 2 [ (1/2)x² - (1/3)x³ ] from 0 to 1 = 2 [ (1/2 - 1/3) - 0 ] = 2 [ (3/6 - 2/6) ] = 2 [1/6] = 1/3.

So, that confirms it. The probability is 1/3.

Wait, so both methods give me 1/3. That seems consistent. So, I think the answer is 1/3.

But just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe combinatorial.

There are four points on the circle. The number of ways to pair them into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each pairing is equally likely? Wait, no, actually, the pairings are not equally likely because the way we choose the points affects the pairings.

Wait, actually, when choosing four points randomly, the probability that a specific pairing occurs is dependent on the order of the points. Hmm, maybe this is a different way to think about it.

Alternatively, the number of intersecting pairings is 1 out of the 3 possible pairings. Because for four points on a circle, there are three ways to pair them, and only one of those pairings results in intersecting chords. So, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that seems too simplistic, but it actually aligns with the previous results. So, if we have four points, the number of ways to pair them is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each of these pairings is equally likely? Or is that not the case?

Wait, actually, no. The pairings are not equally likely because the way the points are arranged affects the probability. For example, if the four points are in order A, B, C, D around the circle, then the pairing AB-CD doesn't intersect, while AC-BD and AD-BC do intersect. Wait, no, actually, in that case, AC and BD would intersect, but AD and BC would also intersect? Wait, no, if the points are in order A, B, C, D, then pairing AC and BD would cross, but pairing AD and BC would also cross? Wait, no, if you pair A with D and B with C, then the chords AD and BC would also cross.

Wait, hold on, if the four points are in order A, B, C, D around the circle, then:

- AB and CD: these chords don't intersect.
- AC and BD: these chords intersect.
- AD and BC: these chords intersect.

So, in this case, two of the three pairings result in intersecting chords. But earlier, I thought that only one pairing would result in intersection. Hmm, so maybe my previous thought was wrong.

Wait, so if the four points are in order A, B, C, D, then pairing AB-CD doesn't intersect, but pairings AC-BD and AD-BC do intersect. So, two out of three pairings result in intersection. But in another arrangement, say A, C, B, D, then:

- AB and CD: intersect.
- AC and BD: intersect.
- AD and BC: don't intersect.

Wait, so in this case, two pairings intersect as well. Hmm, so regardless of the arrangement, two out of three pairings result in intersecting chords? That can't be, because if all four points are close together, maybe only one pairing intersects.

Wait, no, actually, for any four distinct points on a circle, there are exactly two pairings that result in intersecting chords and one that doesn't. Because given four points, you can pair them in three ways, and exactly one of those pairings will result in non-intersecting chords, while the other two will intersect.

Wait, let me think. If you have four points on a circle, say labeled in order as 1, 2, 3, 4. Then:

- Pairing 1-2 and 3-4: these don't intersect.
- Pairing 1-3 and 2-4: these intersect.
- Pairing 1-4 and 2-3: these intersect.

So, yes, exactly two of the three pairings result in intersecting chords. Therefore, if we randomly pair the four points, the probability that a specific pairing intersects is 2/3. But in our problem, the pairing is fixed: AB and CD. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that, among all possible pairings, the specific pairing AB-CD is one of the two that intersect.

But wait, in our problem, the pairing is fixed as AB and CD. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that, given four random points, the specific pairing AB-CD is one of the two intersecting pairings.

But since the points are randomly arranged, the specific pairing AB-CD is equally likely to be any of the three possible pairings. Therefore, the probability that AB-CD is an intersecting pairing is 2/3 divided by 3? Wait, no, that doesn't make sense.

Wait, actually, no. The pairing AB-CD is fixed, so we need to find the probability that this specific pairing intersects. Since, for any four points, two of the three possible pairings intersect, the probability that AB-CD is one of those two is 2/3. But wait, is that correct?

Wait, no, because the pairing AB-CD is fixed, not random. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that, given four random points, the specific pairing AB-CD is an intersecting one. Since, for any four points, two of the three pairings intersect, the probability that AB-CD is one of those two is 2/3. But wait, that contradicts my earlier result of 1/3.

Hmm, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?

Wait, let's clarify. The problem is: four points are chosen randomly on a circle. What is the probability that the specific pairing AB and CD intersect? So, it's not about randomly choosing a pairing, but about a fixed pairing AB and CD.

In that case, the probability is 1/3, as previously calculated, because for four random points, the specific pairing AB and CD intersect only when the points are arranged in an alternating order, which happens with probability 1/3.

But wait, earlier, when I considered the three pairings, I thought that two of them intersect, so the probability that a specific pairing intersects is 2/3. But that seems contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the confusion arises because in the problem, the pairing is fixed, but in the three pairings, each pairing is equally likely to be the one that doesn't intersect. So, if the four points are randomly arranged, the specific pairing AB-CD has a 1/3 chance of being the non-intersecting one, and 2/3 chance of being an intersecting one. But that contradicts the earlier result.

Wait, no, actually, no. Let me think again.

If I fix the pairing AB-CD, then the probability that they intersect is equal to the probability that the four points are arranged in an order where A and B are separated by C and D. As we saw","[1/3.0, '1/3.\n']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem with two circles, both centered at point D. One has a radius of 1 and the other has a radius of 2. The area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of the smaller angle ADC in degrees.

Hmm, let me visualize this. There are two concentric circles, right? Because they both have the same center D. The smaller one has radius 1, and the larger one has radius 2. The shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, the area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. Therefore, the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

Wait, but the shaded region is part of the larger circle, right? So, maybe it's a sector or something. Since there are two circles, maybe the shaded area is the area between the two circles, but only a portion of it. So, perhaps it's a circular segment or a sector minus a smaller sector.

Let me think. If the circles are concentric, then the area between them is an annulus. But the shaded area is a part of that annulus, bounded by two radii and the two arcs. So, it's like a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle.

So, the area of the shaded region would be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. Let me denote the angle at D as θ (theta) in radians. Then, the area of the sector of the larger circle is (1/2)*r^2*θ = (1/2)*(2)^2*θ = 2θ. Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle is (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = (1/2)θ.

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ. According to the problem, this area is equal to (5/3)π. So, I can set up the equation:

(3/2)θ = (5/3)π

Solving for θ:

θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π radians.

Wait, but the question asks for the measure in degrees. So, I need to convert radians to degrees. Since π radians is 180 degrees, θ in degrees is:

θ = (10/9)π * (180/π) = (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.

But wait, the problem mentions the ""menor"" (smaller) angle ADC. So, is 200 degrees the smaller angle? Because in a circle, the total around a point is 360 degrees, so 200 degrees is less than 360, but is it the smaller angle? Wait, 200 degrees is more than 180, so the smaller angle would actually be the reflex angle, which is 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Hmm, but 200 degrees is the angle we calculated. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, let me double-check. The area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. The larger circle's area is 4π, so 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. The area of the shaded region is (3/2)θ, so (3/2)θ = (5/3)π. Solving for θ gives θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π, which is approximately 3.497 radians, which is about 200 degrees.

But in a circle, the angle can be measured in two ways: the smaller arc and the larger arc. Since 200 degrees is more than 180, the smaller angle would actually be 160 degrees. Wait, but the problem says ""the (menor) ângulo ADC"", so it's asking for the smaller angle. So, is it 160 degrees?

Wait, maybe I need to think about this again. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 4π, so 5/12*4π = 5/3π. The area of the sector minus the smaller sector is (3/2)θ. So, (3/2)θ = 5/3π, so θ = (5/3π)*(2/3) = 10/9π radians, which is 200 degrees. But since 200 degrees is the angle of the sector, the smaller angle would be 200 degrees, but wait, 200 degrees is more than 180, so the smaller angle is actually 160 degrees.

Wait, no. The angle ADC is the angle between two radii. If the sector is 200 degrees, then the angle is 200 degrees, but since it's asking for the smaller angle, it's 160 degrees. Hmm, but I'm confused because the area corresponds to the 200-degree sector. So, maybe the angle is 200 degrees, but since it's asking for the smaller angle, it's 160 degrees.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the shaded area is the smaller segment, so the angle is less than 180 degrees. But according to the calculation, the area is 5/3π, which is more than half of the larger circle's area (which is 2π). So, 5/3π is approximately 5.23, and 2π is approximately 6.28, so 5/3π is less than half? Wait, no, 5/3π is about 5.23, which is more than half of 4π (which is 6.28). Wait, no, 4π is about 12.56, so 5/3π is about 5.23, which is less than half of 12.56, which is 6.28. So, 5.23 is less than 6.28, so it's less than half. So, the angle is less than 180 degrees.

Wait, but according to my calculation, θ is 10/9π radians, which is about 200 degrees, which is more than 180. So, that contradicts. So, maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation.

Wait, let's recast the problem. The area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The larger circle has area 4π, so 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. The shaded area is the area between the two sectors, so it's the area of the larger sector minus the smaller sector. So, if θ is the angle in radians, then the area is (1/2)*(2)^2*θ - (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = (2θ - 0.5θ) = 1.5θ. So, 1.5θ = 5/3π. Therefore, θ = (5/3π)/1.5 = (5/3π)/(3/2) = (5/3)*(2/3)π = 10/9π radians.

Convert 10/9π radians to degrees: (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees. So, the angle is 200 degrees. But since it's asking for the smaller angle, which is the acute angle, it's 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Wait, but 160 degrees is still obtuse. Wait, no, 160 is still more than 90, but less than 180. So, is 160 the smaller angle? Or is 200 the angle, and 160 is the reflex angle?

Wait, in a circle, the angle between two radii can be measured in two ways: the smaller arc and the larger arc. The smaller angle is the one less than or equal to 180 degrees, and the larger one is the reflex angle. So, if the sector is 200 degrees, the smaller angle is 160 degrees. But wait, 200 degrees is the angle of the sector, so the angle ADC is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle would be 160 degrees.

Wait, but the problem says ""a medida do (menor) ângulo ADC"". So, it's asking for the measure of the smaller angle ADC. So, if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

But wait, let me think again. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 4π, so 5/12*4π = 5/3π. The area of the sector minus the smaller sector is 1.5θ = 5/3π, so θ = 10/9π radians, which is 200 degrees. So, the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

Wait, but I'm confused because the area corresponds to the 200-degree sector, so the angle is 200 degrees. But since it's asking for the smaller angle, it's 160 degrees. So, I think the answer is 160 degrees.

Wait, but let me check the calculation again. Maybe I made a mistake in the area.

The area of the shaded region is the area of the larger sector minus the smaller sector. So, (1/2)*R^2*θ - (1/2)*r^2*θ = (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)θ. So, (3/2)θ = 5/3π. Therefore, θ = (5/3π)*(2/3) = 10/9π radians, which is 200 degrees. So, the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

Wait, but 200 degrees is the angle of the sector, so the angle ADC is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

Wait, but I'm still a bit confused because the area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 5/12*4π = 5/3π. The area of the annular sector is (3/2)θ, so θ = 10/9π, which is 200 degrees. So, the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

Wait, but let me think about the diagram. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is a significant portion, but less than half. So, 5/12 is approximately 0.4167, which is less than half (0.5). So, the angle should be less than 180 degrees. But according to the calculation, it's 200 degrees, which is more than 180. So, that seems contradictory.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the area calculation. Let me recast it.

The area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. The larger circle's area is 4π, so 5/12*4π = 5/3π. The shaded area is the area between the two sectors, so it's (1/2)*R^2*θ - (1/2)*r^2*θ = (1/2)*(4 - 1)*θ = (3/2)θ. So, (3/2)θ = 5/3π. Therefore, θ = (5/3π)*(2/3) = 10/9π radians, which is 200 degrees.

But 200 degrees is more than 180, so the smaller angle is 160 degrees. But wait, if the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is less than half, then the angle should be less than 180 degrees. So, maybe I have to consider the reflex angle.

Wait, perhaps the shaded area is the smaller segment, so the angle is less than 180 degrees. But according to the calculation, it's 200 degrees, which is more than 180. So, maybe I have to take the reflex angle into account.

Wait, no. The area of the sector is proportional to the angle. So, if the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 5/12*4π = 5/3π, and the area of the sector is (3/2)θ, then θ is 10/9π, which is 200 degrees. So, the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

Wait, but 5/12 is less than half, so the angle should be less than 180 degrees. So, maybe I have to take the smaller angle, which is 160 degrees, but the area would correspond to the reflex angle. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, let me think differently. Maybe the shaded area is the smaller segment, so the angle is less than 180 degrees. So, if the area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 5/3π, and the area of the segment is (1/2)R^2(θ - sinθ). Wait, but that's for a segment, not a sector.

Wait, no, the problem says ""a área total da região sombreada"", which is the total shaded area. If it's a sector minus a smaller sector, then it's (3/2)θ. But if it's a segment, it's different.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify whether the shaded area is a sector or a segment. The problem says ""dois círculos, cada um com centro D, têm raios de 1 e 2"". So, two circles with center D, radii 1 and 2. The area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, the shaded region","[160, '160']",120,"[120, '120']",False
"Primeiro, calculo o volume do béquer cilíndrico usando a fórmula do volume de um cilindro: V = π * r² * h. Com r = 3 cm e h = 8 cm, o volume do béquer é 72π cm³.

Em seguida, calculo o volume do tanque esférico usando a fórmula do volume de uma esfera: V = (4/3) * π * r³. Com r = 6 cm, o volume do tanque é 288π cm³.

Para determinar quantos béqueres são necessários para encher o tanque, divido o volume do tanque pelo volume do béquer: 288π / 72π = 4.

Portanto, são necessários 4 béqueres de água para encher o tanque esférico.
</think>

Para determinar quantos béqueres cilíndricos são necessários para encher um tanque esférico, seguiremos os seguintes passos:

1. **Calcular o volume do béquer cilíndrico:**

   A fórmula do volume de um cilindro é:
   \[
   V_{\text{c}} = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   onde:
   - \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} \) (raio do béquer)
   - \( h = 8 \, \text{cm} \) (altura do béquer)

   Substituindo os valores:
   \[
   V_{\text{c}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \times 9 \times 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3

2. **Calcular o volume do tanque esférico:**

   A fórmula do volume de uma esfera é:
   \[
   V_{\text{e}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
   \]
   onde:
   - \( r = 6 \, \text{cm} \) (raio do tanque)

   Substituindo os valores:
   \[
   V_{\text{e}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

3. **Determinar o número de béqueres necessários:**

   Dividimos o volume do tanque pelo volume de um béquer:
   \[
   \text{Número de béqueres} = \frac{V_{\text{e}}}{V_{\text{c}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = 4

"Okay, so I have this problem to evaluate the expression:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that involve the sine of sums and differences. Maybe I can use those to simplify the expression. Let me recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

So, if I let \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), then the expression becomes:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)
\]

Which, using the identities, would be:

\[
[\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B] \cdot [\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B]
\]

Wait, that looks like the product of a sum and difference, which is a difference of squares. So, this simplifies to:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Okay, so that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to compute this expression. Let me write that down:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

But I know that \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \). So, \( \sin A = 0.4 \) and \( \sin B = 0.5 \). I need to find \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \) to plug into the equation.

I remember that \( \cos(\arcsin x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Let me verify that. If \( \theta = \arcsin x \), then \( \sin \theta = x \), and \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) because \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \). So, yes, that's correct.

So, let's compute \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \):

For \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}
\]
Hmm, \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is approximately 0.9165, but maybe I can keep it exact for now.

For \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \):
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Okay, so \( \cos B \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, plugging back into the expression:

First, compute \( \sin A \cos B \):
\[
\sin A \cos B = 0.4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.2 \sqrt{3}
\]

Then, compute \( \cos A \sin B \):
\[
\cos A \sin B = \sqrt{0.84} \times 0.5 = 0.5 \sqrt{0.84}
\]

Wait, but \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is the same as \( \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Let me check that:

\( 21 \times 4 = 84 \), so \( \sqrt{84} = \sqrt{4 \times 21} = 2 \sqrt{21} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Yes, that's correct.

So, \( \cos A = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Therefore, \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \).

So, now, going back to the expression:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2
\]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 \)
\[
(0.2)^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12
\]

Second term: \( \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2 \)
\[
\frac{21}{100} = 0.21
\]

So, subtracting the second term from the first:

\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Wait, that gives me a negative number. Is that possible? Let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake.

Starting from the beginning:

We have \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \), which is equal to \( (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 \). That seems correct.

Then, \( \sin A = 0.4 \), \( \sin B = 0.5 \). Correct.

\( \cos A = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Correct.

\( \cos B = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Correct.

Then, \( \sin A \cos B = 0.4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.2 \sqrt{3} \). Correct.

\( \cos A \sin B = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \). Correct.

Squaring both:

\( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12 \). Correct.

\( \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2 = \frac{21}{100} = 0.21 \). Correct.

Subtracting: 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09. Hmm, negative. But sine functions can be negative, but in this case, the angles involved are arcsin of positive numbers, so they are in the first quadrant. So, \( A \) and \( B \) are both between 0 and \( \pi/2 \). Therefore, \( A + B \) is less than \( \pi \), and \( A - B \) could be positive or negative depending on which is larger.

Wait, \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately, let me compute that. Since \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is roughly, let's see, \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is 30 degrees, so 0.4 is a bit less, maybe around 23.578 degrees. Similarly, \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is 30 degrees. So, \( A \) is about 23.578 degrees, \( B \) is 30 degrees. So, \( A - B \) is negative, about -6.422 degrees. So, \( \sin(A - B) \) is negative, but when we take the product, it's \( \sin(A + B) \times \sin(A - B) \). So, \( \sin(A + B) \) is positive because \( A + B \) is less than \( \pi \), and \( \sin(A - B) \) is negative because \( A - B \) is negative. So, the product is negative, which matches our result of -0.09.

But let me think if there's another way to compute this expression without going through all these steps, maybe using another identity.

Wait, I remember that \( \sin C \cdot \sin D \) can be expressed using the product-to-sum identities. Let me recall:

\[
\sin C \cdot \sin D = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(C - D) - \cos(C + D)]
\]

But in our case, \( C = A + B \) and \( D = A - B \). So, substituting:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos((A + B) - (A - B)) - \cos((A + B) + (A - B))]
\]
Simplify the arguments:

First term inside cosine: \( (A + B) - (A - B) = 2B \)
Second term inside cosine: \( (A + B) + (A - B) = 2A \)

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos(2B) - \cos(2A)]
\]

Hmm, that's another way to write it. Maybe this is easier to compute.

So, let's compute \( \cos(2B) \) and \( \cos(2A) \).

We know that \( \cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta \). So, let's use that identity.

First, compute \( \cos(2B) \):

\( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), so \( \sin B = 0.5 \). Therefore,

\[
\cos(2B) = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

Next, compute \( \cos(2A) \):

\( A = \arcsin 0.4 \), so \( \sin A = 0.4 \). Therefore,

\[
\cos(2A) = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

So, plugging back into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [0.5 - 0.68] = \frac{1}{2} (-0.18) = -0.09
\]

So, same result as before. So, that confirms that the value is indeed -0.09.

Wait, but the problem is asking to evaluate the expression, so -0.09 is the result. But maybe I should express it as a fraction instead of a decimal.

Let me see, 0.09 is 9/100, so -0.09 is -9/100. But let me check if that's exact.

Wait, in the first method, I had:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

But 0.12 is 3/25, and 0.21 is 21/100. So, 3/25 - 21/100 = 12/100 - 21/100 = -9/100. So, yes, -9/100 is the exact value.

Alternatively, in the second method, using the product-to-sum identity, I got the same result.

So, both methods lead to the same answer, which is reassuring.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -9/100, which is -0.09.

But let me just think again if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using substitution or another identity.

Alternatively, I could have considered letting \( x = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( y = \arcsin 0.5 \), so the expression becomes \( \sin(x + y) \cdot \sin(x - y) \). Then, using the identity \( \sin(x + y)\sin(x - y) = \sin^2 x - \sin^2 y \). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, let me recall: \( \sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \). Yes, that's another identity. So, that's a quicker way.

So, if I use that identity directly:

\[
\sin(x + y)\sin(x - y) = \sin^2 x - \sin^2 y
\]

Where \( x = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( y = \arcsin 0.5 \). Therefore,

\[
\sin^2 x = (0.4)^2 = 0.16
\]
\[
\sin^2 y = (0.5)^2 = 0.25
\]
So,

\[
\sin^2 x - \sin^2 y = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09
\]

Wow, that was much simpler! I should have thought of that identity earlier. So, that's another way to see it.

So, regardless of the method, the result is -0.09, which is -9/100.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -9/100.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify it.

Alternatively, I recall that there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines when their angles are in a geometric progression. Let me think about that.

Looking at the angles: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. I notice that each angle is double the previous one. So, starting from 2π/15, each subsequent angle is multiplied by 2. That seems like a geometric sequence with a common ratio of 2. Maybe I can use a formula related to that.

I remember that for angles in geometric progression, especially when doubling each time, there's a product formula involving sine functions. Let me try to recall it. I think it's something like the product of cos(θ), cos(2θ), cos(4θ), ..., cos(2^{n-1}θ) equals sin(2^n θ) divided by (2^n sin θ). Let me check if that makes sense.

So, if I have n terms, each angle is double the previous, starting from θ, then the product is sin(2^n θ) / (2^n sin θ). Let me test this with a small n. For example, if n=2, then the product is cos θ * cos 2θ. According to the formula, it should be sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ). Let me compute both sides.

Left side: cos θ * cos 2θ. Right side: sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ). Let me compute sin(4θ) using double-angle identities. Sin(4θ) = 2 sin(2θ) cos(2θ) = 2*(2 sin θ cos θ)*cos(2θ) = 4 sin θ cos θ cos 2θ. So, sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ) = (4 sin θ cos θ cos 2θ)/(4 sin θ) = cos θ cos 2θ. That works! So the formula seems correct for n=2.

Great, so maybe I can apply this formula here. Let's see how many terms I have. The angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. That's four terms, so n=4. So, according to the formula, the product should be sin(2^4 θ)/(2^4 sin θ). Let me write that down.

Let θ = 2π/15. Then, the product is cos θ * cos 2θ * cos 4θ * cos 8θ. According to the formula, this should be sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). Let me compute 16θ: 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15. So, sin(32π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)).

Wait, 32π/15 is more than 2π. Let me subtract 2π to find an equivalent angle. 32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the numerator becomes sin(2π/15), and the denominator is 16 sin(2π/15). So, the entire expression simplifies to sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the product of these four cosines is 1/16? Let me verify that because sometimes when angles exceed 2π, the sine function can have different signs or something. Let me check the angle 32π/15.

32π/15 is equal to 2π + 2π/15, so it's coterminal with 2π/15. Since sine has a period of 2π, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, yes, that part is correct. Therefore, the numerator and denominator both have sin(2π/15), which cancels out, leaving 1/16.

But wait, let me make sure that the formula applies here. The formula is for the product of cos θ, cos 2θ, cos 4θ, ..., cos(2^{n-1}θ). In this case, θ is 2π/15, and n=4, so the product is cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). But 16π/15 is greater than π, so cos(16π/15) is negative because it's in the third quadrant where cosine is negative. Similarly, 8π/15 is in the second quadrant, so cosine is negative there as well. So, actually, the product might have a negative sign.

Wait, hold on. Let me compute the signs of each cosine term:

- cos(2π/15): 2π/15 is in the first quadrant, so positive.
- cos(4π/15): 4π/15 is also in the first quadrant, positive.
- cos(8π/15): 8π/15 is in the second quadrant, so negative.
- cos(16π/15): 16π/15 is in the third quadrant, so negative.

So, multiplying these together: positive * positive * negative * negative = positive. So, the overall product is positive. But according to the formula, I got 1/16, which is positive, so that matches.

But wait, let me double-check the formula. The formula is product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ). So, in this case, n=4, so product is sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). As I computed earlier, 16θ = 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But wait, let me compute the product numerically to verify. Let me compute each cosine term:

cos(2π/15): 2π/15 ≈ 0.4189 radians, cos ≈ 0.9135

cos(4π/15): 4π/15 ≈ 0.8377 radians, cos ≈ 0.6691

cos(8π/15): 8π/15 ≈ 1.6755 radians, cos ≈ -0.2079

cos(16π/15): 16π/15 ≈ 3.3510 radians, cos ≈ -0.9781

Now, multiply them together: 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118; then 0.6118 * (-0.2079) ≈ -0.1271; then -0.1271 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.1243.

Hmm, 0.1243 is approximately 1/8, but 1/16 is 0.0625. Wait, that's not matching. Did I make a mistake?

Wait, 0.1243 is roughly 1/8, but according to the formula, it should be 1/16. There's a discrepancy here. Maybe my formula is incorrect or I misapplied it.

Wait, let me check the formula again. The formula is product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ). So, for n=4, it's sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). But in our case, θ is 2π/15, so 16θ is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But when I compute numerically, I get approximately 0.1243, which is roughly 1/8, not 1/16. So, something is wrong here. Maybe the formula is for a different product? Or perhaps I misapplied it.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe it's for the product of cosines with angles θ, 2θ, 4θ, ..., 2^{n-1}θ, which is indeed what I have here. So, n=4, θ=2π/15. So, the product should be sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). But 16θ is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But my numerical calculation gave me approximately 0.1243, which is roughly 1/8. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I made a mistake in the numerical calculation.

Let me recalculate the product step by step:

cos(2π/15): 2π/15 ≈ 0.4189 radians, cos ≈ 0.9135

cos(4π/15): 4π/15 ≈ 0.8377 radians, cos ≈ 0.6691

cos(8π/15): 8π/15 ≈ 1.6755 radians, cos ≈ -0.2079

cos(16π/15): 16π/15 ≈ 3.3510 radians, cos ≈ -0.9781

Now, multiply them:

First, 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ Let's compute 0.9 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6022, and 0.0135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.0090, so total ≈ 0.6112.

Next, 0.6112 * (-0.2079) ≈ -0.6112 * 0.2079 ≈ Let's compute 0.6 * 0.2079 ≈ 0.1247, and 0.0112 * 0.2079 ≈ 0.0023, so total ≈ -0.1270.

Then, -0.1270 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.1270 * 0.9781 ≈ Let's compute 0.1 * 0.9781 ≈ 0.0978, 0.02 * 0.9781 ≈ 0.0196, 0.007 * 0.9781 ≈ 0.0068, so total ≈ 0.0978 + 0.0196 + 0.0068 ≈ 0.1242.

So, approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8. But according to the formula, it should be 1/16. So, there's a conflict here. That means either the formula is incorrect, or I misapplied it.

Wait, maybe the formula is for the product of cosines with angles θ, 2θ, 4θ, ..., 2^{n-1}θ, but in our case, the last term is 16π/15, which is 2^4 * (π/15). Wait, hold on, θ is 2π/15, so 2^4 θ is 16π/15, which is correct. So, n=4, θ=2π/15.

Wait, but in the formula, the product is up to 2^{n-1}θ, so for n=4, it's up to 8θ, which is 16π/15. So, that's correct.

Wait, but in the formula, the product is sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ). So, 2^n θ is 16θ, which is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But my numerical calculation gives approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8, not 1/16. So, something is wrong here. Maybe the formula is for a different product? Or perhaps I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe it's for the product of sines instead of cosines? No, I think it's for cosines. Alternatively, maybe the formula is for the product of cosines with angles θ, 2θ, 4θ, ..., 2^{n-1}θ, but in our case, the angles are 2π/15, 4π","[4, '4']",\frac{1}{16},"[1/16, '\\frac{1}{16}']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, and the altitude AM is 11 units long. There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude AM from A to BC will bisect BC. So, M is the midpoint of BC, and AM is perpendicular to BC. The length of AM is given as 11, so that's the height of the triangle.

Point D is on AM, and AD is 10. Since AM is 11, that means DM must be 1 because 11 - 10 = 1. So, D is very close to M, just 1 unit away from it.

The key piece of information is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.

Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote each of these angles as φ. So, in triangle ABC, the angles are θ at A, and φ at B and C. Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have θ + 2φ = 180°, so φ = (180° - θ)/2.

Now, looking at triangle BDC, which is also a triangle with points B, D, and C. We know angle BDC is 3θ, and we need to find some relations here. Maybe using the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines in triangle BDC.

But before that, let me note down the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let me place point A at (0, 11), since AM is the altitude of length 11. Then, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, points B and C will be symmetric with respect to the y-axis. Let me denote point M as the midpoint of BC, so M is at (0, 0) because AM is the altitude. Wait, no, if AM is 11, then M is at (0, 0), and A is at (0, 11). Then, points B and C will be on the x-axis, symmetric about the y-axis.

So, let me assign coordinates:

- A: (0, 11)
- M: (0, 0)
- B: (-b, 0)
- C: (b, 0)
- D: Since D is on AM, which is the line from (0,11) to (0,0). AD is 10, so D is 10 units below A, which is at (0,11). So, D is at (0,11 - 10) = (0,1).

So, D is at (0,1). Now, I can write coordinates for all points:

- A: (0,11)
- B: (-b,0)
- C: (b,0)
- D: (0,1)
- M: (0,0)

Now, I need to find the value of b, which will help me find the lengths AB, AC, and BC, and hence the perimeter.

Given that angle BDC is 3θ, where θ is angle BAC. Let me compute θ first.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the triangle is symmetric, so the altitude AM splits it into two right triangles, each with legs of length b and 11, and hypotenuse AB.

So, in triangle ABM, which is right-angled at M, we have:

AB = AC = sqrt(b² + 11²) = sqrt(b² + 121)

The base BC is 2b, since B is at (-b,0) and C is at (b,0).

Now, angle BAC is θ. Let me compute θ in terms of b.

In triangle ABC, using the Law of Cosines:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cosθ

But since AB = AC, this simplifies to:

(2b)² = 2*(sqrt(b² + 121))² - 2*(sqrt(b² + 121))²*cosθ

Simplify:

4b² = 2*(b² + 121) - 2*(b² + 121)*cosθ

Let me compute this step by step.

First, expand the right-hand side:

2*(b² + 121) = 2b² + 242

Then, subtract 2*(b² + 121)*cosθ:

So, 4b² = 2b² + 242 - 2*(b² + 121)*cosθ

Subtract 2b² + 242 from both sides:

4b² - 2b² - 242 = -2*(b² + 121)*cosθ

Simplify left side:

2b² - 242 = -2*(b² + 121)*cosθ

Divide both sides by -2:

(-2b² + 242)/2 = (b² + 121)*cosθ

Simplify numerator:

(-b² + 121) = (b² + 121)*cosθ

So,

cosθ = (121 - b²)/(121 + b²)

Okay, so that's an expression for cosθ in terms of b.

Now, moving on to triangle BDC. Points B, D, C are at (-b,0), (0,1), and (b,0) respectively.

I need to find angle BDC, which is at point D, between points B and C.

So, angle BDC is the angle at D between points B and C.

Given that angle BDC = 3θ.

So, I can compute angle BDC using coordinates.

First, let me find the vectors DB and DC.

Point D is at (0,1).

Point B is at (-b,0), so vector DB is (-b - 0, 0 - 1) = (-b, -1)

Point C is at (b,0), so vector DC is (b - 0, 0 - 1) = (b, -1)

So, vectors DB = (-b, -1) and DC = (b, -1)

The angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC, which is 3θ.

We can use the dot product formula to find the cosine of angle BDC.

Dot product of DB and DC is:

(-b)(b) + (-1)(-1) = -b² + 1

The magnitudes of DB and DC are both sqrt(b² + 1), since:

|DB| = sqrt((-b)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(b² + 1)

Similarly, |DC| = sqrt(b² + 1)

So, the cosine of angle BDC is:

cos(angle BDC) = ( -b² + 1 ) / ( sqrt(b² + 1) * sqrt(b² + 1) ) = (1 - b²)/(b² + 1)

But angle BDC is 3θ, so:

cos(3θ) = (1 - b²)/(1 + b²)

But from earlier, we have cosθ = (121 - b²)/(121 + b²)

So, we have:

cos(3θ) = (1 - b²)/(1 + b²)

But we also know that cos(3θ) can be expressed in terms of cosθ using the triple-angle formula:

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

So, substituting cosθ from earlier:

cos(3θ) = 4[(121 - b²)/(121 + b²)]³ - 3[(121 - b²)/(121 + b²)]

And this is equal to (1 - b²)/(1 + b²)

So, we have the equation:

4[(121 - b²)/(121 + b²)]³ - 3[(121 - b²)/(121 + b²)] = (1 - b²)/(1 + b²)

Let me denote x = (121 - b²)/(121 + b²). Then, the equation becomes:

4x³ - 3x = (1 - b²)/(1 + b²)

But I need to express (1 - b²)/(1 + b²) in terms of x.

Wait, let's see:

x = (121 - b²)/(121 + b²)

Let me solve for b² in terms of x.

x = (121 - b²)/(121 + b²)

Multiply both sides by (121 + b²):

x*(121 + b²) = 121 - b²

121x + x b² = 121 - b²

Bring all terms to one side:

121x + x b² + b² - 121 = 0

Factor b²:

121x - 121 + b²(x + 1) = 0

So,

b²(x + 1) = 121(1 - x)

Thus,

b² = [121(1 - x)] / (x + 1)

So, now, let's compute (1 - b²)/(1 + b²):

(1 - b²)/(1 + b²) = [1 - b²]/[1 + b²]

Substitute b² from above:

= [1 - (121(1 - x)/(x + 1))]/[1 + (121(1 - x)/(x + 1))]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator:

1 - [121(1 - x)/(x + 1)] = [ (x + 1) - 121(1 - x) ] / (x + 1 )

= [x + 1 - 121 + 121x ] / (x + 1 )

= [ (1 + 121)x + (1 - 121) ] / (x + 1 )

= [122x - 120] / (x + 1 )

Denominator:

1 + [121(1 - x)/(x + 1)] = [ (x + 1) + 121(1 - x) ] / (x + 1 )

= [x + 1 + 121 - 121x ] / (x + 1 )

= [ (1 - 121)x + (1 + 121) ] / (x + 1 )

= [ -120x + 122 ] / (x + 1 )

So, (1 - b²)/(1 + b²) = [122x - 120]/[ -120x + 122 ] = [122x - 120]/[122 - 120x]

So, going back to the equation:

4x³ - 3x = [122x - 120]/[122 - 120x]

Let me write this as:

4x³ - 3x = (122x - 120)/(122 - 120x)

Let me denote the right-hand side as RHS:

RHS = (122x - 120)/(122 - 120x)

Let me factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 122x - 120 = 2*(61x - 60)

Denominator: 122 - 120x = 2*(61 - 60x)

So, RHS = [2*(61x - 60)]/[2*(61 - 60x)] = (61x - 60)/(61 - 60x)

So, equation becomes:

4x³ - 3x = (61x - 60)/(61 - 60x)

Multiply both sides by (61 - 60x):

(4x³ - 3x)(61 - 60x) = 61x - 60

Let me expand the left-hand side:

First, multiply 4x³ by (61 - 60x):

4x³*61 = 244x³

4x³*(-60x) = -240x⁴

Then, multiply -3x by (61 - 60x):

-3x*61 = -183x

-3x*(-60x) = 180x²

So, altogether:

244x³ - 240x⁴ - 183x + 180x²

So, left-hand side is:

-240x⁴ + 244x³ + 180x² - 183x

Set equal to right-hand side:

-240x⁴ + 244x³ + 180x² - 183x = 61x - 60

Bring all terms to left-hand side:

-240x⁴ + 244x³ + 180x² - 183x - 61x + 60 = 0

Simplify:

-240x⁴ + 244x³ + 180x² - 244x + 60 = 0

Let me write it as:

-240x⁴ + 244x³ + 180x² - 244x + 60 = 0

This is a quartic equation, which seems complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.

Let me factor out a common factor if possible. Let's see:

All coefficients are even except 244 and 244, which are divisible by 4. Wait, 240 is divisible by 4, 244 is 4*61, 180 is 4*45, 244 is 4*61, 60 is 4*15. So, let me factor out a 4:

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I notice that the expression in the middle is x⁴ + 4x². That looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it easier. So, if I let y = x², then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. That seems simpler because now I can deal with a quadratic inequality in y.

Alright, so let me split this compound inequality into two separate inequalities:

1. -4 < y² + 4y
2. y² + 4y < 21

I'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions need to be satisfied.

Starting with the first inequality: -4 < y² + 4y.

Let me rearrange this to bring all terms to one side:

y² + 4y + 4 > 0

Wait, that's because I added 4 to both sides. So, y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, this looks like a perfect square. Let me check:

y² + 4y + 4 = (y + 2)²

Yes, that's correct. So, the inequality becomes (y + 2)² > 0. Now, a square is always non-negative, and it's equal to zero only when y + 2 = 0, which is y = -2. So, (y + 2)² > 0 means y ≠ -2. But since y = x² and x² is always non-negative, y can't be negative. So, y is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, y ≠ -2 is automatically satisfied because y can't be -2. So, the first inequality doesn't impose any additional restrictions beyond y ≥ 0.

Now, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.

Again, I'll bring all terms to one side:

y² + 4y - 21 < 0

This is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.

So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100.

That's a perfect square, so the roots are:

y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2

Calculating both roots:

First root: (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3

Second root: (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7

So, the quadratic can be factored as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.

Now, to solve the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0, I can use a sign chart.

The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3. These divide the number line into three intervals:

1. y < -7
2. -7 < y < 3
3. y > 3

Now, I'll test each interval:

1. For y < -7, let's pick y = -8:
   (-8 - 3)(-8 + 7) = (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0

2. For -7 < y < 3, let's pick y = 0:
   (0 - 3)(0 + 7) = (-3)(7) = -21 < 0

3. For y > 3, let's pick y = 4:
   (4 - 3)(4 + 7) = (1)(11) = 11 > 0

So, the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 is satisfied when -7 < y < 3.

But remember, y = x², which is always non-negative. So, y cannot be less than 0. Therefore, the interval -7 < y < 3 is actually 0 ≤ y < 3 because y can't be negative.

So, combining the two inequalities:

From the first inequality, we have y ≥ 0.

From the second inequality, we have y < 3.

Therefore, the solution for y is 0 ≤ y < 3.

But y = x², so substituting back:

0 ≤ x² < 3

Now, solving for x:

First, x² ≥ 0 is always true for all real x, so that doesn't restrict anything.

Second, x² < 3. To solve this, take square roots:

-√3 < x < √3

So, the solution in terms of x is the interval (-√3, √3).

Wait, let me double-check. The original inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. I transformed it into y² + 4y, found the solution for y, and then converted back to x. Let me verify if this makes sense.

If x is between -√3 and √3, then x² is between 0 and 3. Plugging into x⁴ + 4x²:

When x² = 0, x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0, which is greater than -4 and less than 21.

When x² approaches 3, x⁴ approaches 9, so x⁴ + 4x² approaches 9 + 12 = 21. But since x² is less than 3, x⁴ + 4x² is less than 21. So, that seems correct.

Also, when x² is 0, the expression is 0, which is greater than -4. So, the entire interval (-√3, √3) satisfies the original inequality.

I think that's the solution. So, in interval notation, it's (-√3, √3).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, we solve the inequality \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\):

\[
y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \implies (y + 2)^2 > 0
\]

This is true for all \(y \neq -2\). Since \(y = x^2\) is always non-negative, this condition is automatically satisfied.

Next, we solve the inequality \(y^2 + 4y < 21\):

\[
y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula, we find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\):

\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]

This gives the roots \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic inequality \((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\) is satisfied for \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, we have \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[
0 \leq x^2 < 3
\]

This implies:

\[
-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

Thus, the solution in interval notation is \(\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}\).","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, I need to find \( xy + yz + zx \). I remember that in problems involving symmetric sums, sometimes it's helpful to use identities or known formulas. Let me think about what I know.

First, I recall that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Maybe that could be useful here since I have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) and \( xyz \) given.

Let me compute \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \). Plugging in the known values:

\( 4 - 3 \times 4 = 4 - 12 = -8 \).

So, \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \).

Hmm, that's one equation involving \( x + y + z \) and \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx \). I don't know either of these yet, so maybe I need another equation.

Looking at the third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of symmetric sums.

Let me see. The expression \( xy^2 + x^2 y \) can be factored as \( xy(y + x) \). Similarly, \( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \) and \( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \). So, the entire expression becomes:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \).

Hmm, that's a bit better. Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). These are the standard symmetric sums.

I also know that \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \). Maybe that can help.

Looking back at the expression I had earlier:

\( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \).

Substituting \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \), we get:

\( S(S^2 - 2P - P) = S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \).

So, \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \). Let me write that as equation (4):

4. \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \)

Now, let's go back to the third equation, which I rewrote as:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \).

Let me express each term in terms of S and P. For example, \( x + y = S - z \), \( x + z = S - y \), and \( y + z = S - x \). So, substituting these in:

\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \).

Expanding each term:

\( xyS - xyz + xzS - xyz + yzS - xyz = 12 \).

Combine like terms:

\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \).

But \( xy + xz + yz = P \) and \( xyz = 4 \), so substituting:

\( S \times P - 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Simplify:

\( SP - 12 = 12 \).

So, \( SP = 24 \). Let me note that as equation (5):

5. \( SP = 24 \)

Now, from equation (4): \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \). But from equation (5), \( SP = 24 \), so substitute that into equation (4):

\( S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8 \).

Compute \( 3 \times 24 = 72 \), so:

\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \).

Adding 72 to both sides:

\( S^3 = 64 \).

Therefore, \( S = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \).

So, \( S = 4 \). Now, from equation (5), \( SP = 24 \), so \( 4P = 24 \), which means \( P = 6 \).

Therefore, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the third equation, I expressed it in terms of S and P correctly. Then, using the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \), I found another equation involving S and P. Then, I solved the system of equations to find S and P. It seems consistent.

So, I think the answer is 6.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
</think>

Given the equations:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Substituting the given values:

\[ 4 - 3 \times 4 = -8 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \]

Let \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). We know that \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[ S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \]

Next, we consider the third equation. Rewriting it, we have:

\[ xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \]

Expressing each term in terms of \( S \) and \( P \):

\[ xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \]

Expanding and combining like terms:

\[ S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \]

Substituting \( xy + xz + yz = P \) and \( xyz = 4 \):

\[ SP - 12 = 12 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ SP = 24 \]

We now have two equations:

1. \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \)
2. \( SP = 24 \)

Substituting \( SP = 24 \) into the first equation:

\[ S^3 - 72 = -8 \]

Solving for \( S \):

\[ S^3 = 64 \]
\[ S = 4 \]

Using \( SP = 24 \) with \( S = 4 \):

\[ 4P = 24 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

Thus, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is:

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions, I need to consider the critical points where the expression can change its sign. Also, I should note where the denominator is zero because the expression is undefined there.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

I know that the absolute value in the numerator, \(|x^2 - 81|\), is always non-negative because absolute values can't be negative. So, the numerator is either zero or positive. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which is a quadratic expression. I should factor that to find its roots.

Let me factor the denominator:

\(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\)

So, the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are the points where the expression is undefined, so I need to exclude them from the solution set.

Now, the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\). Let me factor that as well:

\(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). Therefore, the numerator is \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, as I thought earlier.

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Since the numerator is always non-negative, the sign of the entire expression depends on the denominator. The inequality is less than zero, so the expression must be negative. That means the denominator must be negative because the numerator is non-negative.

Therefore, the inequality reduces to finding where the denominator is negative:

\(x(x - 36) < 0\)

To solve this inequality, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These divide the real number line into three intervals:

1. \(x < 0\)
2. \(0 < x < 36\)
3. \(x > 36\)

I'll test each interval to see where the product \(x(x - 36)\) is negative.

1. For \(x < 0\), let's pick \(x = -1\):
   \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive. So, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

2. For \(0 < x < 36\), let's pick \(x = 1\):
   \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative. So, this interval satisfies the inequality.

3. For \(x > 36\), let's pick \(x = 37\):
   \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive. So, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the denominator is negative only when \(0 < x < 36\). But wait, I also need to consider the numerator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), that is, when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). At these points, the entire expression is zero, but the inequality is strict (less than zero, not less than or equal to). So, these points are excluded from the solution.

So, I need to exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the interval \(0 < x < 36\). But wait, \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), so only \(x = 9\) is within that interval. Therefore, I need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the solution.

Putting it all together, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 0, 36, and 9. So, in interval notation, that would be:

\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)
\]

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The numerator is always non-negative, so the expression can only be negative if the denominator is negative. The denominator is negative between 0 and 36, but we have to exclude points where the numerator is zero because the expression would be zero there, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but only \(x = 9\) is in the interval where the denominator is negative. So, yes, excluding 9 is correct.

Also, I should confirm that at \(x = 9\), the expression is zero, which is not less than zero, so it's correctly excluded. Similarly, at \(x = -9\), the expression is zero, but since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval where the denominator is negative, it doesn't affect our solution.

Therefore, the solution set is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).

To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we start by noting that the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative. The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\), which is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), making the expression undefined at these points.

3. \(x > 36\): The product is positive.

Thus, the denominator is negative in the interval \(0 < x < 36\). We exclude \(x = 9\) because the numerator is zero there, making the expression zero, which does not satisfy the inequality. The point \(x = -9\) is not in this interval and is already excluded.

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular field surrounded by an athletic track. The track consists of two sides of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. I need to find the maximum possible area of the field. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the Asymptote code draws a rectangle with two semicircular ends. So, the track is like a rectangle with semicircles on each end, right? That makes the track similar to a running track you see in a stadium. The two straight sides are the lengths of the rectangle, and the two semicircles make up the curved ends.

Let me denote the length of the rectangle as 'l' and the width as 'w'. So, the straight parts of the track are each of length 'l', and the curved parts are semicircles with diameter 'w'. Since there are two semicircles, together they make a full circle. So, the total length of the track would be the sum of the two straight sides and the circumference of the full circle.

Wait, let me write that down:

Total length of the track = 2*l + circumference of the circle.

But the circumference of a circle is 2πr, where r is the radius. In this case, the diameter of each semicircle is 'w', so the radius is w/2. Therefore, the circumference of the full circle would be 2π*(w/2) = πw.

So, the total length of the track is 2*l + πw = 400 meters.

Okay, so that's our constraint: 2l + πw = 400.

Now, the area of the field is the area of the rectangle, which is l*w. We need to maximize this area given the constraint on the track length.

So, this is an optimization problem with a constraint. I think I can use calculus to solve this, specifically using the method of Lagrange multipliers or substitution. Since it's a single constraint, substitution might be straightforward.

Let me express one variable in terms of the other using the constraint. Let's solve for l:

2l + πw = 400

So, 2l = 400 - πw

Divide both sides by 2:

l = (400 - πw)/2

Now, substitute this into the area formula:

Area = l*w = [(400 - πw)/2] * w = (400w - πw²)/2

So, Area = (400w - πw²)/2

Now, to find the maximum area, I need to find the value of w that maximizes this quadratic function. Since the coefficient of w² is negative (-π/2), the parabola opens downward, so the vertex will give the maximum point.

Alternatively, I can take the derivative of the area with respect to w, set it equal to zero, and solve for w.

Let me do that.

Let A(w) = (400w - πw²)/2

Compute dA/dw:

dA/dw = (400 - 2πw)/2 = 200 - πw

Set derivative equal to zero:

200 - πw = 0

Solve for w:

πw = 200

w = 200/π

Okay, so the width that maximizes the area is 200/π meters.

Now, plug this back into the expression for l:

l = (400 - πw)/2

Substitute w = 200/π:

l = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100

So, l = 100 meters.

Therefore, the maximum area is l*w = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π square meters.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations.

Starting from the constraint:

2l + πw = 400

We found w = 200/π, so plugging back in:

2l + π*(200/π) = 400

Simplify:

2l + 200 = 400

2l = 200

l = 100

Yes, that's correct.

So, the area is 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.

Hmm, 20000 divided by π. Let me compute that numerically to get an idea.

π is approximately 3.1416, so 20000 / 3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977 square meters.

But the question asks for the area in terms of π, so 20000/π is the exact value.

Wait, but let me think again. Is this the maximum area? Because sometimes when dealing with optimization, especially with multiple variables, you have to ensure that it's indeed a maximum.

Since the area function is quadratic in terms of w, and the coefficient of w² is negative, it's a downward opening parabola, so the critical point we found is indeed the maximum.

Alternatively, if I consider the second derivative test:

d²A/dw² = -π, which is negative, confirming that it's a maximum.

So, yes, 20000/π is the maximum area.

Wait, but let me think about the units. The track is 400 meters, so the dimensions are in meters, so the area is in square meters, which is correct.

Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using geometry instead of calculus?

Let me think. The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircles. So, the total length is 2l + πw = 400.

We can think of this as a function of l and w, and we need to maximize the area A = l*w.

This is a standard optimization problem where we can use the AM-GM inequality or other methods, but since it's a linear constraint and a quadratic objective, calculus is the straightforward approach.

Alternatively, we can express the area in terms of a single variable and find its maximum.

Wait, another thought: if I consider the track as a rectangle with semicircular ends, the total perimeter is 2l + πw = 400.

So, if I fix the perimeter, the maximum area occurs when the shape is as close to a circle as possible. But in this case, it's a rectangle with semicircular ends, so it's a combination of a rectangle and a circle.

But in our case, the maximum area occurs when the rectangle's length is 100 meters and the width is 200/π meters. So, it's not a perfect circle, but a specific rectangle with semicircular ends.

Wait, if I think about it, if the track were a full circle, the circumference would be 400 meters, so radius would be 400/(2π) = 200/π, and the area would be π*(200/π)^2 = π*(40000/π²) = 40000/π ≈ 12732.395 square meters. But in our case, the area is 20000/π ≈ 6366.1977, which is exactly half of that. Interesting.

So, the maximum area of the field is half the area of the circle with circumference 400 meters. That makes sense because the track is a combination of a rectangle and a circle, but the field itself is just the rectangle, which is half the area of the circle.

Wait, is that a general result? If you have a track that's a rectangle with semicircular ends, the maximum area of the rectangle is half the area of the circle with the same perimeter? Hmm, maybe.

But in any case, for this problem, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

Let me just recap:

1. The track has two straight sides of length l and two semicircular ends with diameter w.
2. The total length of the track is 2l + πw = 400.
3. The area of the field is A = l*w.
4. Express l in terms of w: l = (400 - πw)/2.
5. Substitute into A: A = (400w - πw²)/2.
6. Take derivative dA/dw = 200 - πw, set to zero: w = 200/π.
7. Find l = 100.
8. Compute area: 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.

Yes, that seems consistent.

I think I'm confident with this answer. So, the maximum area is 20000 divided by π, which is approximately 6366.2 square meters, but since the question asks for the exact value, it's 20000/π.

**Final Answer**
The maximum area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.

The problem involves finding the maximum area of a rectangular field surrounded by an athletic track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

1. Let \( l \) be the length and \( w \) be the width of the rectangular field.
2. The total length of the track is given by the sum of the two straight sides and the circumference of the full circle formed by the two semicircles:
   \[
   2l + \pi w = 400
   \]
3. Express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
   \[
   l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2}
   \]
4. The area \( A \) of the field is given by:
   \[
   A = l \cdot w = \left( \frac{400 - \pi w}{2} \right) w = \frac{400w - \pi w^2}{2}
   \]
5. To maximize the area, take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0
   \]
6. Solving for \( w \):
   \[
   \pi w = 200 \implies w = \frac{200}{\pi}
   \]
7. Substitute \( w \) back into the expression for \( l \):
   \[
   l = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
   \]
8. The maximum area is:
   \[
   A = l \cdot w = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
   \]

Thus, the maximum area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.","[20000/pi, '\\frac{20000}{\\pi}']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"Okay, so I have this triangle RST, and it's a right triangle because there's a right angle at S. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, RS is the vertical side from (2,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), which means RS has a length of sqrt(21). ST is the horizontal side from (0,0) to (2,0), so that's length 2. RT is the hypotenuse, connecting (0,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), and the problem says that RT is 5 units long. 

Wait, let me confirm that. The distance between R(2, sqrt(21)) and T(0,0) should be sqrt[(2-0)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 21] = sqrt[25] = 5. Yep, that checks out. So RT is indeed 5.

The problem says that sin R is 2/5, and we need to find sin T. Hmm, okay. Let me recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, which is at point R, the opposite side would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT. Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle RST, angle R is at point R, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle R would be relative to that angle. So, in triangle RST, angle R is at (2, sqrt(21)), so the sides adjacent to angle R are RS and RT. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me visualize the triangle.

Point R is at the top, S is at the bottom right, and T is at the bottom left. So, angle R is the top angle, angle S is the right angle, and angle T is the bottom left angle. So, in triangle RST, angle R is opposite side ST, and angle T is opposite side RS.

Wait, let me clarify. In triangle RST, the sides are RS, ST, and RT. So, side RS is opposite angle T, side ST is opposite angle R, and side RT is the hypotenuse opposite the right angle at S.

So, sin R is opposite over hypotenuse, which would be ST / RT. The problem says sin R is 2/5, and RT is 5, so ST must be 2. That makes sense because ST is from (0,0) to (2,0), which is length 2. So, that's consistent.

Now, we need to find sin T. Angle T is at point T, so the opposite side to angle T is RS, and the hypotenuse is RT. So, sin T = RS / RT. We know RT is 5, and RS is sqrt(21). So, sin T should be sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me make sure. RS is the vertical side from S(2,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)), so its length is sqrt(21). So, yes, RS is sqrt(21). Therefore, sin T is RS / RT, which is sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, since we know the sides, we can also compute it using the coordinates. The coordinates of T are (0,0), S are (2,0), and R are (2, sqrt(21)). So, angle T is at (0,0). The sides adjacent to angle T are ST (length 2) and RT (length 5). Wait, no, in terms of angle T, the sides are: opposite side is RS (sqrt(21)), adjacent side is ST (2), and hypotenuse is RT (5). So, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, which is sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, using the Pythagorean theorem, since we have a right triangle, we can confirm the sides. We know ST is 2, RT is 5, so RS should be sqrt(5^2 - 2^2) = sqrt(25 - 4) = sqrt(21). So that's consistent.

Therefore, sin T is sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. The triangle is right-angled at S, so sides are RS, ST, and hypotenuse RT. Given sin R = 2/5, which is opposite over hypotenuse, so opposite side is ST = 2, hypotenuse RT = 5. Then RS is sqrt(21). So, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, which is RS / RT = sqrt(21)/5. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was to correctly identify which sides correspond to which angles. Since angle R is at the top, its opposite side is ST, and angle T is at the bottom left, its opposite side is RS. So, using the definitions of sine in a right triangle, it's straightforward.

Another way to think about it is using the coordinates. The coordinates of R are (2, sqrt(21)), so from T(0,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)) is the hypotenuse. The vertical component is sqrt(21), which is the opposite side to angle T, and the horizontal component is 2, which is adjacent. So, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, which is sqrt(21)/5.

Yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}
</think>

In $\triangle RST$, we are given that $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$ and need to find $\sin T$. 

First, we note that $\triangle RST$ is a right triangle with the right angle at $S$. The coordinates of the points are $T(0,0)$, $S(2,0)$, and $R(2, \sqrt{21})$. The hypotenuse $RT$ is given as 5 units.

We confirm the lengths of the sides:
- $ST$ is the horizontal side from $(0,0)$ to $(2,0)$, so its length is 2.
- $RS$ is the vertical side from $(2,0)$ to $(2, \sqrt{21})$, so its length is $\sqrt{21}$.
- $RT$ is the hypotenuse, calculated as $\sqrt{(2-0)^2 + (\sqrt{21}-0)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 21} = \sqrt{25} = 5$.

Given $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$, we know that $\sin R$ is the ratio of the opposite side $ST$ to the hypotenuse $RT$. This confirms $ST = 2$ and $RT = 5$.

To find $\sin T$, we use the opposite side $RS$ and the hypotenuse $RT$. Thus, $\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}$.

Therefore, the value of $\sin T$ is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The answer needs to be expressed in the form \( \sqrt{a}/b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I have to find \( a + b \).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the distance from a point to another point is given by the distance formula. So, if I have a point \( (x, y) \) on the graph, the distance from the origin \( (0, 0) \) to this point is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since I want the shortest distance, I need to minimize this distance.

But minimizing the square of the distance might be easier because the square root function is monotonically increasing, so the minimum of the distance will occur at the same point as the minimum of the squared distance. That should simplify the calculations.

So, let me define the squared distance function \( D(x) \) as:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + y^2
\]

But since \( y \) is given by the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), I can substitute that into the distance formula:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2
\]

Let me compute that step by step. First, square the \( y \) term:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 (x^2 - 3)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]

So, substituting back into \( D(x) \):

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]

Now, I need to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( D(x) \). To do this, I can take the derivative of \( D(x) \) with respect to \( x \), set it equal to zero, and solve for \( x \).

Let me compute the derivative \( D'(x) \):

First, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \) to make differentiation easier.

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

So, substituting back into \( D(x) \):

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Now, take the derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[
D'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out common terms:

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

So, the critical points are at \( x = 0 \) and \( x^2 = 2 \), which gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum distance. Since distance is always positive, I can evaluate \( D(x) \) at each critical point and see which one is smaller.

First, evaluate at \( x = 0 \):

\[
D(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

So, the squared distance is \( \frac{9}{2} \), which means the distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \). But let me check the other critical points.

Next, evaluate at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

First, compute \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( (\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

So, the point is \( (\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2}) \). Now, compute the squared distance:

\[
D(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

Similarly, for \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), since \( x^2 \) is the same, the squared distance will also be \( \frac{5}{2} \).

Comparing the squared distances: \( \frac{9}{2} \) at \( x = 0 \) and \( \frac{5}{2} \) at \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). Clearly, \( \frac{5}{2} \) is smaller, so the minimum distance occurs at \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \).

Therefore, the minimum distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \). But let me express this in the form \( \sqrt{a}/b \).

Simplify \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \):

\[
\sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Let me double-check.

Wait, \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \) is equal to \( \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \). To rationalize the denominator, we can multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Yes, that's correct. So, the distance is \( \sqrt{10}/2 \).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. The squared distance at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) was \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \), which is indeed \( \sqrt{10}/2 \). So, that's correct.

So, in the form \( \sqrt{a}/b \), we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). But wait, the problem says \( a \) should not be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Let's check if 10 is square-free.

The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, both of which are primes, and neither is squared. So, 10 is square-free. Therefore, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \).

Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

Wait, hold on a second. Let me just verify my calculations again because sometimes I might have messed up a step.

Starting from the squared distance function:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]

Expanding \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

So,

\[
D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Taking the derivative:

\[
D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting equal to zero:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0 \implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \implies x = 0, \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluating \( D(x) \) at these points:

At \( x = 0 \):

\[
D(0) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(0 - 3)^2 = \frac{9}{2}
\]

At \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
D(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{1}{2}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(1) = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

So, yes, that's correct. So, the minimal squared distance is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

Therefore, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \).

Wait, but just to make sure, is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using calculus of variations or something else? Hmm, I don't think so. The method I used is standard for minimizing distance: express the distance squared as a function, take the derivative, find critical points, and evaluate.

Alternatively, I could think of this as an optimization problem with a constraint. The constraint is the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), and I want to minimize \( x^2 + y^2 \). So, using Lagrange multipliers might be another approach.

Let me try that method to confirm.

Let me set up the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = x^2 + y^2 - \lambda \left( y - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)
\]

Taking partial derivatives:

1. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2x - \lambda \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right) = 2x - \lambda \cdot \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 2y - \lambda = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = - \left( y - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right) = 0 \)

So, from equation 2: \( 2y = \lambda \implies \lambda = 2y \)

From equation 1: \( 2x - \lambda \cdot \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \)

Substitute \( \lambda = 2y \):

\[
2x - 2y \cdot \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
2x - \frac{4xy}{\sqrt{2}} = 0
\]

Factor out 2x:

\[
2x \left( 1 - \frac{2y}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 0
\]

So, either \( x = 0 \) or \( 1 - \frac{2y}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \).

Case 1: \( x = 0 \)

From the constraint equation (equation 3):

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0 - 3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

So, the point is \( (0, -3/\sqrt{2}) \). The squared distance is \( 0 + (9/2) = 9/2 \), as before.

Case 2: \( 1 - \frac{2y}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \implies \frac{2y}{\sqrt{2}} = 1 \implies y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

From equation 2, \( \lambda = 2y = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \)

From the constraint equation (equation 3):

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)
\]

But we have \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), so:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)
\]

Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{2} = x^2 - 3 \implies \frac{2}{2} = x^2 - 3 \implies 1 = x^2 - 3 \implies x^2 = 4 \implies x = \pm 2
\]

Wait, hold on, this is different from the previous result where \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). Did I make a mistake here?

Wait, let me check the calculations again.

From equation 1:

\[
2x - \lambda \cdot \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = 0

"Okay, so I have this function f defined piecewise, and I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, let me write down the function first to make sure I understand it correctly.

The function f(x) is defined as:
- 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3,
- -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function with two different expressions depending on whether x is less than or equal to 3 or greater than 3. I need to find the inverse function values at 0 and 6, then add them together.

First, let me recall what an inverse function does. If f(a) = b, then f inverse of b is a. So, to find f inverse of 0, I need to find the value(s) of x such that f(x) = 0. Similarly, for f inverse of 6, I need to find x such that f(x) = 6.

Since f is piecewise, I should check both pieces for each value.

Starting with f inverse of 0:

Case 1: x ≤ 3. So, f(x) = 3 - x. Let's set this equal to 0 and solve for x.

3 - x = 0
=> -x = -3
=> x = 3

So, x = 3 is a solution in this case. But I should check if x = 3 is indeed in the domain of this piece, which it is because x ≤ 3.

Case 2: x > 3. Here, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's set this equal to 0 and solve for x.

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0
Let me factor this equation. First, factor out a -x:

-x(x² - 2x - 3) = 0

So, either -x = 0 => x = 0, or x² - 2x - 3 = 0.

But x = 0 is not in the domain of this piece since x > 3. So, we can ignore x = 0.

Now, solving x² - 2x - 3 = 0.

Using quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2.

So, x = (2 + 4)/2 = 6/2 = 3, or x = (2 - 4)/2 = (-2)/2 = -1.

Again, x = 3 is not in the domain of this piece (x > 3), and x = -1 is also not in the domain. So, in this case, there are no solutions for x > 3 when f(x) = 0.

Therefore, the only solution is x = 3. So, f inverse of 0 is 3.

Now, moving on to f inverse of 6.

Again, I need to solve f(x) = 6 for x, considering both pieces.

Case 1: x ≤ 3. So, f(x) = 3 - x.

Set 3 - x = 6.

Solving for x:

3 - x = 6
=> -x = 6 - 3
=> -x = 3
=> x = -3

Now, check if x = -3 is in the domain of this piece, which is x ≤ 3. Yes, -3 ≤ 3, so that's a valid solution.

Case 2: x > 3. Here, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x.

Set this equal to 6:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Let me rearrange the equation:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Now, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe I can factor by grouping.

Group terms:

(x³ - 2x²) + (-3x + 6) = 0

Factor out x² from the first group and -3 from the second:

x²(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0

Now, factor out (x - 2):

(x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0

So, the solutions are x = 2 or x² - 3 = 0 => x = sqrt(3) or x = -sqrt(3).

But wait, in this case, x > 3, so let's check if any of these solutions satisfy x > 3.

x = 2: 2 is not greater than 3, so discard.

x = sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732: Also not greater than 3, discard.

x = -sqrt(3) ≈ -1.732: Also not greater than 3, discard.

So, in this case, there are no solutions for x > 3 when f(x) = 6.

Therefore, the only solution is x = -3. So, f inverse of 6 is -3.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my factoring because sometimes I might make a mistake there.

Original equation after moving 6 to the left:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

I multiplied by -1: x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Then, grouping:

(x³ - 2x²) + (-3x + 6) = 0

x²(x - 2) - 3(x - 2) = 0

So, (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0

Yes, that seems correct. So, the roots are x = 2, sqrt(3), -sqrt(3). None of these are greater than 3, so indeed, no solution in this piece.

Therefore, f inverse of 6 is -3.

So, now, adding f inverse of 0 and f inverse of 6:

f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that's interesting. So, the sum is zero.

But let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations.

For f inverse of 0:

In the first piece, x ≤ 3: 3 - x = 0 => x = 3. Correct.

In the second piece, x > 3: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Factored as -x(x² - 2x - 3) = 0, leading to x = 0, 3, -1. None of these are greater than 3, so only x = 3 is a solution. Correct.

For f inverse of 6:

First piece, x ≤ 3: 3 - x = 6 => x = -3. Correct.

Second piece, x > 3: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Rearranged to x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0, factored as (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0, roots at 2, sqrt(3), -sqrt(3). None are greater than 3, so only x = -3 is a solution. Correct.

Therefore, f^{-1}(0) = 3, f^{-1}(6) = -3, so their sum is 0.

Hmm, that seems straightforward, but let me just visualize the function to make sure.

For x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x is a linear function decreasing from f(3) = 0 to the left. So, it's a straight line with slope -1, starting at (3, 0) and going down as x decreases.

For x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let me see what this looks like. It's a cubic function. Let me compute its value at x = 3: f(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, it's continuous at x = 3.

What about its behavior as x increases beyond 3? Let's compute f(4): -64 + 32 + 12 = -20. So, f(4) = -20. Hmm, that's negative. What about f(5): -125 + 50 + 15 = -60. So, it's decreasing as x increases beyond 3.

Wait, so for x > 3, the function is decreasing from 0 to negative infinity? So, it's a cubic that goes to negative infinity as x approaches positive infinity.

Therefore, for x > 3, f(x) is decreasing, starting at 0 when x = 3, and going down. So, it never reaches 6 again because it's decreasing. So, the only solution for f(x) = 6 is in the first piece, which is x = -3.

Similarly, for f(x) = 0, in the first piece, x = 3 is the solution, and in the second piece, the function is 0 at x = 3, but since x > 3 is required, there are no solutions there. So, only x = 3.

Therefore, my calculations seem correct.

So, f^{-1}(0) = 3, f^{-1}(6) = -3, so their sum is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) for the piecewise function \( f \) defined as:

\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. **Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3 \]
   - For \( x > 3 \):
     \[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
     Factoring out \(-x\):
     \[ -x(x^2 - 2x - 3) = 0 \]
     Solving \( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \) gives roots \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \), neither of which are greater than 3. Thus, no solution in this piece.
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3 \]
   - For \( x > 3 \):
     \[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
     Rearranging and factoring:
     \[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0 \]
     Factoring by grouping:
     \[ (x - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \]
     Solving gives roots \( x = 2 \), \( x = \sqrt{3} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \), none of which are greater than 3. Thus, no solution in this piece.
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results together:

\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a point P inside a regular octahedron, and the distances from P to five of the vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular octahedron has eight triangular faces and six vertices, right? It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases.

First, let me visualize the octahedron. It has two apex vertices and four base vertices. In the Asymptote code provided, the vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F. From the coordinates given, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), and F is (0,0,-1). So, it's centered at the origin, and each vertex is along one of the coordinate axes, either positive or negative.

Point P is somewhere inside this octahedron, and we know its distances to five of these vertices. The distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the sixth distance. Hmm, how can I approach this?

I recall that in a regular octahedron, the vertices are symmetric with respect to the origin. So, if I consider the coordinates of P, say (x, y, z), then the distances from P to each vertex can be expressed using the distance formula. For example, the distance from P to A (1,0,0) is sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2], and similarly for the other vertices.

Wait, maybe I can use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any interior point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. Is that true? Let me think. For a regular octahedron centered at the origin, if P is a point inside, then the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex might have a relationship.

Let me try to write down the equations. Let’s denote the distances from P to A, B, C, D, E, F as d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D, d_E, d_F respectively. So, we have:

d_A^2 = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2

d_B^2 = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2

d_C^2 = x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2

d_D^2 = x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2

d_E^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2

d_F^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2

Now, if I add all these distances squared together:

d_A^2 + d_B^2 + d_C^2 + d_D^2 + d_E^2 + d_F^2

Let me compute this sum:

= [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]

Let me expand each term:

First term: (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2

Second term: (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2

Third term: x^2 + (y^2 - 2y + 1) + z^2

Fourth term: x^2 + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + z^2

Fifth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1)

Sixth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1)

Now, let's add all these up:

For x^2 terms: 2*(x^2 - 2x + 1) + 2*(x^2 + 2x + 1) + 2*(x^2) + 2*(x^2) + 2*(x^2) + 2*(x^2). Wait, no, actually, each term is separate. Let me count each term:

First term: x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2

Second term: x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2

Third term: x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2

Fourth term: x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2

Fifth term: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1

Sixth term: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1

So, adding all these:

Number of x^2 terms: 6

Number of y^2 terms: 6

Number of z^2 terms: 6

Now, the linear terms:

-2x + 2x -2y + 2y -2z + 2z

These cancel out: (-2x + 2x) = 0, (-2y + 2y) = 0, (-2z + 2z) = 0

Constant terms: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6

So, the total sum is 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6

But wait, each term also includes y^2 and z^2, so actually, each term is x^2 + y^2 + z^2 plus some linear terms and constants.

Wait, maybe I should compute it differently. Let me think.

Each of the six terms is of the form (x ± 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2, (x)^2 + (y ± 1)^2 + z^2, or (x)^2 + y^2 + (z ± 1)^2.

So, when I add all six, I get:

For x-direction: (x - 1)^2 + (x + 1)^2 + 4x^2

Similarly for y and z.

Wait, no. Let me see:

Looking at the six terms:

- Two terms have (x ± 1)^2: (x - 1)^2 and (x + 1)^2

- Two terms have (y ± 1)^2: (y - 1)^2 and (y + 1)^2

- Two terms have (z ± 1)^2: (z - 1)^2 and (z + 1)^2

And the other four terms for each coordinate? Wait, no, actually, each coordinate is only in two terms with ±1 and the other four terms have just x^2, y^2, z^2.

Wait, no, actually, for each coordinate, two of the six terms have (coordinate ±1)^2, and the other four terms have just the square of the coordinate.

Wait, let me count:

For x: in d_A^2 and d_B^2, we have (x ±1)^2, and in the other four distances (C, D, E, F), we have x^2.

Similarly for y: in d_C^2 and d_D^2, we have (y ±1)^2, and in the other four distances (A, B, E, F), we have y^2.

Same for z: in d_E^2 and d_F^2, we have (z ±1)^2, and in the other four distances (A, B, C, D), we have z^2.

So, for each coordinate, two terms have (coordinate ±1)^2 and four terms have just coordinate^2.

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances is:

For x: 2*(x^2 ± 2x + 1) + 4x^2

Similarly for y and z.

Wait, let me compute it step by step.

Sum of d_A^2 + d_B^2:

= (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 + (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2

= [ (x^2 - 2x + 1) + (x^2 + 2x + 1) ] + 2y^2 + 2z^2

= [2x^2 + 2] + 2y^2 + 2z^2

Similarly, sum of d_C^2 + d_D^2:

= x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 + x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2

= 2x^2 + [ (y^2 - 2y + 1) + (y^2 + 2y + 1) ] + 2z^2

= 2x^2 + [2y^2 + 2] + 2z^2

Similarly, sum of d_E^2 + d_F^2:

= x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 + x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2

= 2x^2 + 2y^2 + [ (z^2 - 2z + 1) + (z^2 + 2z + 1) ]

= 2x^2 + 2y^2 + [2z^2 + 2]

So, adding all these together:

Sum of d_A^2 + d_B^2 + d_C^2 + d_D^2 + d_E^2 + d_F^2

= [2x^2 + 2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2] + [2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2 + 2z^2] + [2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2]

Wait, no, actually, each pair (A,B), (C,D), (E,F) contributes:

For (A,B): 2x^2 + 2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2

For (C,D): 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2 + 2z^2

For (E,F): 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

So, adding all three:

2x^2 + 2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2 + 2z^2 + 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

Combine like terms:

x^2 terms: 2x^2 + 2x^2 + 2x^2 = 6x^2

y^2 terms: 2y^2 + 2y^2 + 2y^2 = 6y^2

z^2 terms: 2z^2 + 2z^2 + 2z^2 = 6z^2

Constants: 2 + 2 + 2 = 6

So, total sum is 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6

But wait, 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6 can be factored as 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1). But is there a way to relate this to something else?

Wait, if I consider the coordinates of P, (x, y, z), then x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is the square of the distance from P to the origin. Let's denote this as r^2, where r is the distance from P to the origin.

So, the sum of the squares of the distances is 6(r^2 + 1). Therefore, if I can find r^2, I can compute the sum.

But I don't know r^2. However, I do know five of the six distances. Let me denote the unknown distance as d. So, the sum of the squares is 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2.

Calculating that:

3^2 = 9

7^2 = 49

8^2 = 64

9^2 = 81

11^2 = 121

So, sum of known squares: 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = let's compute step by step:

9 + 49 = 58

58 + 64 = 122

122 + 81 = 203

203 + 121 = 324

So, the sum of the squares of the known distances is 324. Therefore, the total sum is 324 + d^2.

But from earlier, the total sum is also 6(r^2 + 1). So,

324 + d^2 = 6(r^2 + 1)

But I don't know r^2. Hmm, is there another equation that relates r^2?

Wait, maybe I can find r^2 from the coordinates. Since P is inside the octahedron, which is centered at the origin, and the octahedron has vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), (0, 0, ±1). So, the distance from P to the origin is r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). But how does that help me?

Wait, perhaps I can find another relationship. Let me think about the coordinates.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from the point to the center plus 6. Wait, that seems similar to what I have.

Primeiro, reescrevo a equação da linha na forma Ax + By + C = 0. A partir de y = 2x - 2, subtraio 2x e adiciono 2 a ambos os lados, obtendo -2x + y + 2 = 0. Assim, A = -2, B = 1 e C = 2.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the set of three expressions involving the roots of a quartic equation. The equation is given as \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), and the roots are \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). The set I need to determine is \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). 

Hmm, since it's a quartic equation, I remember that Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Maybe I can use that here. Let me recall Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation. For a general quartic equation \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\)

In our case, the equation is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), so comparing to the general form, we have \(a = 2\), \(b = 0\) (since there's no \(x^2\) term), \(c = 0\) (since there's no \(x\) term), and \(d = 2\). 

So applying Vieta's formulas:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

Okay, so I need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let me denote these three expressions as \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) respectively. So,

\(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)

\(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\)

\(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\)

I need to find the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\). 

I remember that in symmetric polynomials, these kinds of expressions can sometimes be related to the coefficients of the polynomial. Maybe I can find a polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2, S_3\), and then find its coefficients using Vieta's formulas.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\) and \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\) and \(S_1S_2S_3\) in terms of the known sums and products of the roots.

Let me try that approach.

First, let's compute \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):

\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

Looking at this, it's the sum of all possible products of two roots, which is exactly the second Vieta's formula. So,

\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)

So, the sum of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) is 0.

Next, let's compute \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\). This might be a bit more involved.

First, let's compute \(S_1S_2\):

\(S_1S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\)

Let me expand this:

\(= \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_4\)

Simplify each term:

\(= \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider that \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the elementary symmetric sums of degree 2 for pairs of roots. Wait, but they are not exactly the elementary symmetric sums, because each \(S_i\) is a sum of two products, not all possible products.

Wait, maybe I can think of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) as the sums of products of roots taken two at a time, but grouped differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the square of the sum of the roots. Let me recall that:

\((\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)\)

We know that \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), so squaring both sides:

\((-2)^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \times 0\)

So, \(4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2\)

Therefore, \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = 4\)

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe useful later.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products \(S_1S_2\), \(S_1S_3\), \(S_2S_3\) and try to find a pattern or relate them to known sums.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can consider the polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Let me denote this polynomial as \(P(y) = y^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)y^2 + (S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3)y - S_1S_2S_3\). Since I know \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), the polynomial simplifies to \(P(y) = y^3 + (S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3)y - S_1S_2S_3\).

If I can find \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\) and \(S_1S_2S_3\), then I can write this polynomial and perhaps find its roots, which are the \(S_i\)'s.

So, let's try to compute \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\).

First, let's compute \(S_1S_2\):

\(S_1S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\)

Expanding this:

\(= \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)

Similarly, \(S_1S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

Expanding:

\(= \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)

And \(S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

Expanding:

\(= \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)

Now, if I sum all these up: \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\), let's collect like terms.

Looking at each term:

From \(S_1S_2\):

- \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\)
- \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4\)
- \(\alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)
- \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)

From \(S_1S_3\):

- \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4\)
- \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\)
- \(\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)
- \(\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)

From \(S_2S_3\):

- \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)
- \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\)
- \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2\)
- \(\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)

So, let's list all the terms:

1. \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)
4. \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)
5. \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4\)
6. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\)

8. \(\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)

11. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2\)
12. \(\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\)

Now, let's group similar terms:

Terms with \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\):

- \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1^2(\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)\)

Similarly, terms with \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\):

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Let's say AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. The center O is where the diagonals intersect, so it's the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Given that AB/AD = k, so if I let AD be the height of the rectangle, then AB is the length, and their ratio is k. So, if I denote AD as h, then AB would be k*h. That makes sense.

Now, the rectangle has sides of length AB = k*h and AD = h. So, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = k*h^2. That will be useful later when calculating probabilities.

The problem is about finding the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. So, essentially, I need to find the set of all points P inside the rectangle such that the distance from P to O is less than the distance from P to A, B, C, and D.

To approach this, I think I can use the concept of Voronoi diagrams. In a Voronoi diagram, the plane is divided into regions based on proximity to each point in a set. In this case, the set is the four vertices and the center O. So, the region where points are closer to O than to any vertex would be the Voronoi cell around O.

But since we're dealing with a rectangle, maybe I can find the boundaries where the distance to O equals the distance to each vertex. These boundaries will form curves, and the intersection of these curves will define the region where points are closer to O.

Let me set up a coordinate system to make this easier. Let's place the center O at the origin (0,0). Then, since the rectangle is centered at O, the coordinates of the vertices can be defined in terms of h and k.

If AD is the height, then half of AD is h/2, and half of AB is (k*h)/2. So, the coordinates of the vertices would be:

- A: (-k*h/2, h/2)
- B: (k*h/2, h/2)
- C: (k*h/2, -h/2)
- D: (-k*h/2, -h/2)

So, the rectangle extends from (-k*h/2, -h/2) to (k*h/2, h/2).

Now, let's consider a point P(x,y) inside the rectangle. The distance from P to O is sqrt(x^2 + y^2). The distances from P to each vertex are:

- Distance to A: sqrt((x + k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2)
- Distance to B: sqrt((x - k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2)
- Distance to C: sqrt((x - k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2)
- Distance to D: sqrt((x + k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2)

We need the set of points where sqrt(x^2 + y^2) is less than all four of these distances. To find the boundaries, we can set the distance to O equal to the distance to each vertex and solve for the equations.

Let's start with the distance to A:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt((x + k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2)

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:

x^2 + y^2 = (x + k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2

Expanding the right side:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + k*h*x + (k*h/2)^2 + y^2 - h*y + (h/2)^2

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + y^2 - h*y + h^2/4

Subtract x^2 + y^2 from both sides:

0 = k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 - h*y + h^2/4

Let's rearrange terms:

k*h*x - h*y + (k^2*h^2 + h^2)/4 = 0

Divide both sides by h (assuming h ≠ 0, which it isn't since it's a rectangle):

k*x - y + (k^2*h + h)/4 = 0

Simplify:

k*x - y + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = 0

So, the equation is y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Wait, that seems a bit off. Let me check my algebra again.

Wait, when I expanded (x + k*h/2)^2, it's x^2 + k*h*x + (k*h/2)^2, which is correct. Similarly, (y - h/2)^2 is y^2 - h*y + (h/2)^2, which is also correct.

So, when I subtract x^2 + y^2 from both sides, I get:

0 = k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 - h*y + h^2/4

So, grouping terms:

k*h*x - h*y + (k^2*h^2 + h^2)/4 = 0

Factor h:

h*(k*x - y + (k^2*h + h)/4) = 0

Since h ≠ 0, we can divide both sides by h:

k*x - y + (k^2*h + h)/4 = 0

Factor h in the last term:

k*x - y + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = 0

So, solving for y:

y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Wait, that seems correct. So, the boundary between points closer to O and closer to A is the line y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4.

Similarly, I can find the boundaries for the other vertices.

Let's do the same for vertex B.

Distance to B: sqrt((x - k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2)

Set equal to distance to O:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt((x - k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2)

Square both sides:

x^2 + y^2 = (x - k*h/2)^2 + (y - h/2)^2

Expand the right side:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 - k*h*x + (k*h/2)^2 + y^2 - h*y + (h/2)^2

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 - k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + y^2 - h*y + h^2/4

Subtract x^2 + y^2:

0 = -k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 - h*y + h^2/4

Rearrange:

- k*h*x - h*y + (k^2*h^2 + h^2)/4 = 0

Divide by h:

- k*x - y + (k^2*h + h)/4 = 0

So, y = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Okay, so the boundary between O and B is y = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4.

Similarly, let's find the boundaries for vertices C and D.

Starting with vertex C: distance to C is sqrt((x - k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2)

Set equal to distance to O:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt((x - k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2)

Square both sides:

x^2 + y^2 = (x - k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2

Expand:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 - k*h*x + (k*h/2)^2 + y^2 + h*y + (h/2)^2

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 - k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + y^2 + h*y + h^2/4

Subtract x^2 + y^2:

0 = -k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + h*y + h^2/4

Rearrange:

- k*h*x + h*y + (k^2*h^2 + h^2)/4 = 0

Divide by h:

- k*x + y + (k^2*h + h)/4 = 0

So, y = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Wait, let me check:

From 0 = -k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + h*y + h^2/4

Divide by h:

0 = -k*x + (k^2*h)/4 + y + h/4

So, y = k*x - (k^2*h + h)/4

Which is y = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Similarly, for vertex D: distance to D is sqrt((x + k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2)

Set equal to distance to O:

sqrt(x^2 + y^2) = sqrt((x + k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2)

Square both sides:

x^2 + y^2 = (x + k*h/2)^2 + (y + h/2)^2

Expand:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + k*h*x + (k*h/2)^2 + y^2 + h*y + (h/2)^2

Simplify:

x^2 + y^2 = x^2 + k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + y^2 + h*y + h^2/4

Subtract x^2 + y^2:

0 = k*h*x + (k^2*h^2)/4 + h*y + h^2/4

Rearrange:

k*h*x + h*y + (k^2*h^2 + h^2)/4 = 0

Divide by h:

k*x + y + (k^2*h + h)/4 = 0

So, y = -k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Alright, so now I have four lines:

1. From A: y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4
2. From B: y = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4
3. From C: y = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4
4. From D: y = -k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4

These four lines should form a diamond (a rotated square) inside the rectangle where the points are equidistant to O and the respective vertices. The region where points are closer to O than to any vertex would be the intersection of the regions defined by being below the lines from A and B, and above the lines from C and D.

Wait, let me think. For a point to be closer to O than to A, it must lie below the line from A, right? Because the line from A is the boundary where distance to O equals distance to A. So, points below that line are closer to O, and above are closer to A.

Similarly, for point B, the line is y = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4. Points below this line would be closer to O, and above closer to B.

For points closer to O than to C, they must lie above the line y = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4, because above that line is closer to O, and below is closer to C.

Similarly, for D, points must lie above the line y = -k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4.

So, the region where all four conditions are satisfied is the intersection of:

- Below y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4
- Below y = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4
- Above y = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4
- Above y = -k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4

This should form a diamond shape centered at O, bounded by these four lines.

To find the area of this region, I can find the points where these lines intersect each other and then calculate the area of the resulting polygon.

Let me find the intersection points.

First, find where y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 intersects y = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4.

Set them equal:

k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = -k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Bring terms together:

k*x + k*x = 0

2*k*x = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = k*0 + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = h*(k^2 + 1)/4

So, one intersection point is (0, h*(k^2 + 1)/4)

Similarly, find where y = k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 intersects y = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4.

Set equal:

k*x + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = k*x - h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Subtract k*x:

h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = -h*(k^2 + 1)/4

Which implies h*(k^2 + 1)/4 + h*(k^2 + 1)/4 = 0 => h*(k^2 + 1)/2 = 0

But h ≠ 0 and k^2 + 1 > 0, so this is impossible. So, these two lines are parallel and don't intersect.

Wait, that can't be. Wait, no, actually, y = k*x + c and y = k*x - c are parallel lines with the same slope, so they never intersect. Similarly, y = -k*x + c and y = -k*x - c are also parallel.

So, the four lines form a diamond with two pairs of parallel","[0, '0']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². But since ω³ = 1, and we're dealing with complex numbers, ω can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined (since 1 + 1 = 2, which is fine, but let me check that later). Wait, actually, if ω is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I think the problem is more interesting when ω is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1. So maybe I should consider ω and ω² as the non-trivial roots.

I recall that the cube roots of unity satisfy the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That might be useful here. Let me write that down: ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So, maybe I can use this equation to simplify the expression.

The expression I need to evaluate is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me denote this as S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I need to find S.

To add these two fractions, I should find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). So, the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator:

Numerator = (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².

So, S = (2 + ω + ω²) / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].

But from the equation ω² + ω + 1 = 0, I know that ω + ω² = -1. So, substituting that into the numerator:

Numerator = 2 + (-1) = 1.

So, S = 1 / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].

Now, I need to compute the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me expand this:

(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.

But ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, the expression becomes:

1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (-1) = 1.

So, the denominator is 1. Therefore, S = 1 / 1 = 1.

Wait, so S = 1? That seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started with S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).
2. Found a common denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).
3. Expanded the numerator: 2 + ω + ω².
4. Used ω + ω² = -1 to simplify numerator to 1.
5. Expanded the denominator: 1 + ω² + ω + ω³ = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
6. So, S = 1/1 = 1.

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me try another approach to confirm. Maybe by rationalizing the denominators or using substitution.

Alternatively, I can note that since ω³ = 1, ω ≠ 1, so ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Let me express 1/(1 + ω) in terms of ω².

From ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we can write ω² = -ω - 1. So, 1 + ω = -ω². Therefore, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(-ω²) = -1/ω².

Similarly, 1 + ω² = -ω, so 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.

Therefore, S = -1/ω² - 1/ω.

But since ω³ = 1, 1/ω = ω² and 1/ω² = ω. So, substituting back:

S = -ω - ω².

But from ω² + ω + 1 = 0, we have ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, S = -(-1) = 1.

So, again, I get S = 1. That confirms my earlier result.

Wait, but let me think again. If ω is a primitive cube root of unity, then ω ≠ 1, and ω² is the other root. So, in both cases, whether ω is ω or ω², the expression S should evaluate to the same value, which is 1.

Is there another way to see this? Maybe by plugging in the actual values of ω.

The cube roots of unity are 1, (-1 + i√3)/2, and (-1 - i√3)/2. Let me denote ω = (-1 + i√3)/2 and ω² = (-1 - i√3)/2.

Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

First, compute 1 + ω:

1 + ω = 1 + (-1 + i√3)/2 = (2 - 1 + i√3)/2 = (1 + i√3)/2.

Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1 - i√3)/2 = (2 - 1 - i√3)/2 = (1 - i√3)/2.

Now, compute 1/(1 + ω):

1/(1 + ω) = 2/(1 + i√3). To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

2/(1 + i√3) * (1 - i√3)/(1 - i√3) = [2(1 - i√3)] / (1 + 3) = [2 - 2i√3]/4 = (1 - i√3)/2.

Similarly, compute 1/(1 + ω²):

1/(1 + ω²) = 2/(1 - i√3). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

2/(1 - i√3) * (1 + i√3)/(1 + i√3) = [2(1 + i√3)] / (1 + 3) = [2 + 2i√3]/4 = (1 + i√3)/2.

Now, add them together:

(1 - i√3)/2 + (1 + i√3)/2 = [1 - i√3 + 1 + i√3]/2 = (2)/2 = 1.

So, again, I get S = 1. That's consistent with my previous results.

Wait, so regardless of whether ω is ω or ω², the expression evaluates to 1. So, the only possible value is 1.

But let me think again. The problem says ""todos os valores possíveis"" which is Portuguese for ""all possible values."" So, does that mean there could be more than one value? Or is it just 1?

Wait, ω³ = 1 has three roots: 1, ω, ω². But if ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, even when ω = 1, the expression is 1. So, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression evaluates to 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

Wait, but let me check when ω = 1. If ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² = 2 as well, since ω² = 1. So, 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, yes, even when ω = 1, the expression is 1.

Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression evaluates to 1. So, the only possible value is 1.

I think that's solid. I've approached it algebraically, using the properties of cube roots of unity, and also by plugging in the actual complex numbers. Both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the value is 1.

**Final Answer**

Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we note that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, so the cube roots of unity are 1, \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\). The non-trivial cube roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We start with the expression:
\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

To combine these fractions, we find a common denominator:
\[
S = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Simplifying the numerator:
\[
(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega) = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Using the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator:
\[
2 + (-1) = 1
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), this becomes:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + (-1) = 1
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
S = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

We also verified this result by substituting the actual values of \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) and simplifying, which confirmed that the expression evaluates to 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point A, B, C, or D, and visiting the other three points exactly once. The figure is drawn with Asymptote, and the coordinates are given for each point. Let me try to visualize it first.

From the Asymptote code, the points are:
- A at (-3,3)
- B at (3,0)
- C at (0,-4)
- D at (0,0)

So, D is at the origin, A is in the northwest, B is to the east, and C is directly south. The figure is drawn with lines connecting D to B, B to C, C to D, D to A, A to B, A to C, and D to A. The labels on the edges give the distances:
- D to B is 3 units
- A to B is 6 units
- A to C is 6 units
- D to C is 4 units
- A to D is 5 units
- C to B is 5 units

Wait, hold on, the Asymptote code labels ""3"" on D--B, ""6"" on A--B, ""6"" on A--C, ""4"" on D--C, ""5"" on A--D, and ""5"" on C--B. So, the distances are as follows:

- AB: 6
- AC: 6
- AD: 5
- BC: 5
- BD: 3
- CD: 4

So, the graph is a complete graph with four nodes, each connected to the others with the given distances. So, the problem is essentially asking for the shortest possible route that starts at any node and visits all four nodes exactly once. That sounds like the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) on a complete graph with four nodes.

Since it's a small graph, maybe I can compute all possible permutations and calculate the total distance for each, then pick the smallest one. There are 4 starting points, and for each starting point, there are 3! = 6 permutations of the remaining points. So, in total, 4 * 6 = 24 possible routes. But since the starting point can be any of the four, maybe I can fix a starting point and compute the minimal route from there, then compare.

Alternatively, since the graph is symmetric in some way, maybe I can find the minimal Hamiltonian circuit or path. Wait, but the problem says starting at any point and visiting the other three, so it's a path, not necessarily a circuit. So, it's a Hamiltonian path, not a circuit.

Wait, no, actually, the problem says ""começar em qualquer ponto, A, B, C ou D, e visitar os outros três pontos uma vez."" So, starting at any point and visiting the other three once. So, it's a path that starts at one point and goes through the other three, so it's a Hamiltonian path, not necessarily returning to the start.

So, the goal is to find the shortest Hamiltonian path in this graph. Since it's a complete graph with four nodes, each node connected to every other node, the number of possible paths is manageable.

Let me list all possible Hamiltonian paths and calculate their total distances.

First, let's list all possible starting points and their permutations.

Starting at A:
1. A -> B -> C -> D
2. A -> B -> D -> C
3. A -> C -> B -> D
4. A -> C -> D -> B
5. A -> D -> B -> C
6. A -> D -> C -> B

Starting at B:
1. B -> A -> C -> D
2. B -> A -> D -> C
3. B -> C -> A -> D
4. B -> C -> D -> A
5. B -> D -> A -> C
6. B -> D -> C -> A

Starting at C:
1. C -> A -> B -> D
2. C -> A -> D -> B
3. C -> B -> A -> D
4. C -> B -> D -> A
5. C -> D -> A -> B
6. C -> D -> B -> A

Starting at D:
1. D -> A -> B -> C
2. D -> A -> C -> B
3. D -> B -> A -> C
4. D -> B -> C -> A
5. D -> C -> A -> B
6. D -> C -> B -> A

So, that's 24 paths. Now, let's compute the total distance for each.

Starting with A:

1. A -> B -> C -> D:
   AB = 6, BC = 5, CD = 4. Total = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
2. A -> B -> D -> C:
   AB = 6, BD = 3, DC = 4. Total = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
3. A -> C -> B -> D:
   AC = 6, CB = 5, BD = 3. Total = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
4. A -> C -> D -> B:
   AC = 6, CD = 4, DB = 3. Total = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
5. A -> D -> B -> C:
   AD = 5, DB = 3, BC = 5. Total = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
6. A -> D -> C -> B:
   AD = 5, DC = 4, CB = 5. Total = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

So, starting at A, the minimal total is 13, achieved by paths 2, 4, and 5.

Now, starting at B:

1. B -> A -> C -> D:
   BA = 6, AC = 6, CD = 4. Total = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16
2. B -> A -> D -> C:
   BA = 6, AD = 5, DC = 4. Total = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
3. B -> C -> A -> D:
   BC = 5, CA = 6, AD = 5. Total = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
4. B -> C -> D -> A:
   BC = 5, CD = 4, DA = 5. Total = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
5. B -> D -> A -> C:
   BD = 3, DA = 5, AC = 6. Total = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
6. B -> D -> C -> A:
   BD = 3, DC = 4, CA = 6. Total = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

So, starting at B, the minimal total is 13, achieved by path 6.

Starting at C:

1. C -> A -> B -> D:
   CA = 6, AB = 6, BD = 3. Total = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
2. C -> A -> D -> B:
   CA = 6, AD = 5, DB = 3. Total = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
3. C -> B -> A -> D:
   CB = 5, BA = 6, AD = 5. Total = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
4. C -> B -> D -> A:
   CB = 5, BD = 3, DA = 5. Total = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
5. C -> D -> A -> B:
   CD = 4, DA = 5, AB = 6. Total = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
6. C -> D -> B -> A:
   CD = 4, DB = 3, BA = 6. Total = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13

So, starting at C, the minimal total is 13, achieved by paths 4 and 6.

Starting at D:

1. D -> A -> B -> C:
   DA = 5, AB = 6, BC = 5. Total = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
2. D -> A -> C -> B:
   DA = 5, AC = 6, CB = 5. Total = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
3. D -> B -> A -> C:
   DB = 3, BA = 6, AC = 6. Total = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
4. D -> B -> C -> A:
   DB = 3, BC = 5, CA = 6. Total = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
5. D -> C -> A -> B:
   DC = 4, CA = 6, AB = 6. Total = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
6. D -> C -> B -> A:
   DC = 4, CB = 5, BA = 6. Total = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

So, starting at D, the minimal total is 14, achieved by path 4.

Now, compiling the minimal totals from each starting point:
- Starting at A: 13
- Starting at B: 13
- Starting at C: 13
- Starting at D: 14

So, the minimal total distance is 13, achieved by several paths starting at A, B, and C.

Wait, but let me double-check if I didn't make any calculation errors.

For example, starting at A, path A->B->D->C: AB=6, BD=3, DC=4. 6+3+4=13. Correct.

Starting at B, path B->D->C->A: BD=3, DC=4, CA=6. 3+4+6=13. Correct.

Starting at C, path C->B->D->A: CB=5, BD=3, DA=5. 5+3+5=13. Correct.

So, all these paths give a total of 13. Is there a shorter path? Let me see.

Wait, is there a way to get a shorter path? Let me think about the connections.

Looking at the graph, the edges have the following distances:

AB:6, AC:6, AD:5, BC:5, BD:3, CD:4.

So, the shortest edges are BD=3 and CD=4, then AD=5, BC=5, and the longer ones are AB=6, AC=6.

So, to minimize the total distance, we should try to use the shortest edges as much as possible.

Looking at the minimal paths:

From A: A->B->D->C: uses AB=6, BD=3, DC=4. Total 13.

From B: B->D->C->A: uses BD=3, DC=4, CA=6. Total 13.

From C: C->B->D->A: uses CB=5, BD=3, DA=5. Total 13.

Alternatively, is there a path that uses BD=3 and CD=4, but in a different order?

Wait, for example, starting at D: D->B->C->A: DB=3, BC=5, CA=6. Total 14.

But if we start at D, can we do better? D->C->B->A: DC=4, CB=5, BA=6. Total 15.

No, that's worse.

Alternatively, starting at A, is there a way to go A->D->C->B: AD=5, DC=4, CB=5. Total 14.

Which is more than 13.

So, seems 13 is the minimal.

Wait, but let me check another path: starting at A, A->D->B->C: AD=5, DB=3, BC=5. Total 13. Yes, that's another path with total 13.

Similarly, starting at C, C->D->B->A: CD=4, DB=3, BA=6. Total 13.

So, multiple paths achieve the total of 13.

Therefore, the minimal distance is 13.

I think that's the answer.
</think>

The shortest distance is achieved by several paths, each totaling 13 units. Therefore, the minimal distance is \boxed{13}.","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
