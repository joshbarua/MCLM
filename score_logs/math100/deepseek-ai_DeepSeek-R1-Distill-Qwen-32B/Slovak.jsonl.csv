"Okay, so I have this problem here where I'm given a right triangle, and I need to find the length of side DE. The diagram shows a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E. They've given me that the sine of angle D is 0.7, and one of the sides, which is EF, is 7 units long. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what sine means in a right triangle. Sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, and the sides are DE, EF, and DF. Since it's a right triangle at E, the sides DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse.

So, if angle D is at point D, then the opposite side to angle D would be EF, and the hypotenuse is DF. Therefore, sin D = opposite/hypotenuse = EF/DF. They've given that sin D is 0.7, and EF is 7. So, plugging in the values, 0.7 = 7 / DF. 

Wait, so if I solve for DF, that would be DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me calculate that. 7 divided by 0.7 is the same as 70 divided by 7, which is 10. So, DF is 10 units long. Okay, that gives me the hypotenuse.

Now, I need to find DE. Since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem, which says that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, DF² = DE² + EF². I know DF is 10 and EF is 7, so plugging those in: 10² = DE² + 7². That simplifies to 100 = DE² + 49.

To find DE², I subtract 49 from both sides: DE² = 100 - 49 = 51. So, DE is the square root of 51. Let me check if that makes sense. The square root of 51 is approximately 7.141, which seems reasonable because DE should be longer than EF since angle D is opposite the longer side. Wait, actually, no, EF is 7, and DE is sqrt(51), which is about 7.14, so it's just a bit longer. That seems okay.

Alternatively, I could have used cosine instead of the Pythagorean theorem. Since sin D is 0.7, which is 7/10, then cos D would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is DE/DF. So, cos D = DE / 10. But I don't know cos D yet. However, I can find it using the identity sin² D + cos² D = 1. So, cos² D = 1 - sin² D = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51. Therefore, cos D is sqrt(0.51). So, DE = 10 * sqrt(0.51). Wait, sqrt(0.51) is the same as sqrt(51)/10, right? Because sqrt(51)/10 squared is 51/100, which is 0.51. So, DE = 10 * (sqrt(51)/10) = sqrt(51). Yep, same result. So that checks out.

Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me recap. Given sin D = 0.7, which is 7/10, so hypotenuse DF is 10. Then, using Pythagoras, DE² = 10² - 7² = 100 - 49 = 51, so DE is sqrt(51). Alternatively, using cosine, since cos D = sqrt(1 - 0.49) = sqrt(0.51), which is sqrt(51)/10, so DE = 10 * sqrt(51)/10 = sqrt(51). Both methods give the same answer, so I think that's correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The steps seem straightforward. I converted the sine ratio to find the hypotenuse, then used Pythagoras to find the missing side. Alternatively, I used the cosine ratio after finding it from the sine, which also gave me the same result. So, I feel confident that DE is sqrt(51).

**Final Answer**
The length of DE is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we need to find the length of side DE. We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of side EF is 7 units.

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle, which is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\). Given \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for \(DF\), we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of DE. The theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Thus, \(DE = \sqrt{51}\).

Therefore, the length of DE is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise. The given complex numbers are \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that rotating a complex number around another point involves a few steps. It's not just a simple rotation about the origin; I have to translate the system so that the point \( c \) becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense because rotating around a point other than the origin requires shifting the coordinate system.

So, step by step, I should:

1. Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \) to move the center of rotation to the origin.
2. Apply the rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians.
3. Translate back by adding \( c \) to the result.

Let me write this down mathematically. If \( w \) is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), then:

\[ w = c + e^{i\theta}(z - c) \]

Yes, that formula seems right. So, I need to compute \( z - c \) first, then multiply by \( e^{i\pi/4} \), and then add \( c \) back.

Let me compute \( z - c \). Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) ] \]
Simplify the real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)
Simplify the imaginary part: \( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = (-3\sqrt{2})i \)
So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)

Okay, that simplifies nicely. Now, I need to multiply this by \( e^{i\pi/4} \). I remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \). So, for \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):

\[ e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

So, multiplying \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} \):

Let me denote \( z - c = a + bi \), where \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = -3\sqrt{2} \). Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

\[ (a + bi)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \]

Let me compute this multiplication step by step.

First, expand the product:

\[ a \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + a \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + bi \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + bi \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Simplify each term:

1. \( a \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
2. \( a \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = i \)
3. \( bi \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3\sqrt{2}i) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \cdot \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)
4. \( bi \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3\sqrt{2}i) \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot i^2 \)
   - \( i^2 = -1 \), so this becomes \( -3\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (-1) \)
   - Compute \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 2 \), so \( -3 \cdot 2 / 2 = -3 \)
   - Multiply by (-1): \( -3 \cdot (-1) = 3 \)

Now, combine all four terms:

1. Real parts: 1 + 3 = 4
2. Imaginary parts: i - 3i = -2i

So, the result of the multiplication is \( 4 - 2i \).

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication because sometimes signs can be tricky.

Starting again:

\( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \)

Multiply term by term:

First term: \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second term: \( \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Third term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \cdot \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

Fourth term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \cdot \frac{2}{2} \cdot i^2 = -3 \cdot (-1) = 3 \)

So, adding all together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i. Okay, that seems correct.

So, after rotation, the translated point is \( 4 - 2i \). Now, I need to translate back by adding \( c \).

Given \( c = 2 - 3i \), so:

\[ w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i \]

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, \( w = 6 - 5i \). Hmm, let me verify if I did everything correctly.

Let me recap:

1. \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)
2. Multiply by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)
3. Result: 4 - 2i
4. Add c: 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i

Yes, that seems consistent. But just to be thorough, let me check the multiplication again.

Multiplying \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

Let me write it as:

\( (\sqrt{2})(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) + (\sqrt{2})(i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) + (-3\sqrt{2}i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) + (-3\sqrt{2}i)(i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \)

Compute each term:

1. \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)
2. \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)
3. \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)
4. \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2} \times i^2 = -3 \times (-1) = 3 \)

Adding them up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. Yep, same result.

So, adding back \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \). So, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially rotations, it's easy to mix up the direction or the multiplication.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent \( z \) and \( c \) as vectors and perform the rotation using vector operations.

Let me represent \( z \) and \( c \) in the complex plane. \( z = (2 + \sqrt{2}, -3 - 3\sqrt{2}) \) and \( c = (2, -3) \). So, the vector from \( c \) to \( z \) is \( z - c = (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \).

To rotate this vector by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), I can use the rotation matrix:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \]

For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), this becomes:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \]

Multiplying this matrix by the vector \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \):

First component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Compute:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

Second component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Compute:

\( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{-6}{2} = 1 - 3 = -2 \)

So, the rotated vector is \( (4, -2) \). Adding back the center \( c = (2, -3) \):

\( (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5) \), which corresponds to the complex number \( 6 - 5i \). So, same result.

Therefore, I can be confident that \( w = 6 - 5i \).

But just to make sure, let me think about another way. Maybe using complex number multiplication directly.

Expressing \( z - c \) as \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \), which can be written as \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \). Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

So,

\( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Factor out \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \). So, the multiplication becomes:

\( 1 \times (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \)

Wait, because \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(1 + i) \), so when multiplied by \( \sqrt{2} \), it becomes \( (1 + i) \).

So, \( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \):

Multiply out:

\( 1 \times 1 + 1 \times i - 3i \times 1 - 3i \times i \)
= \( 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 \)
= \( 1 - 2i - 3(-1) \)
= \( 1 - 2i + 3 \)
= \( 4 - 2i \)

So, same result as before. Then, adding \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \). Yep, consistent.

Therefore, I think I can be confident that \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Just to recap, the steps were:

1. Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \): \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)
2. Rotate this translated point by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \): multiply by \( e^{i\pi/4} \), resulting in \( 4 - 2i \)
3. Translate back by adding \( c \): \( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - ","[6, '6 - ']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify the square root of 242, I start by factoring 242 into its prime components. I recognize that 242 divided by 2 equals 121, and 121 is 11 squared. This means 242 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 11 squared.

Next, I apply the property of square roots that allows me to separate the factors under the square root. This gives me the square root of 2 multiplied by the square root of 11 squared. Since the square root of 11 squared is simply 11, I can simplify the expression further.

Finally, I combine the results to obtain the simplified form of the square root of 242, which is 11 times the square root of 2.

To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), follow these steps:

1. **Factor 242 into its prime components:**
   
   \[

   Since \(121 = 11^2\), we can rewrite 242 as:
   
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11^2
   \]

2. **Apply the square root to each factor:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}
   \]
   
   Using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we get:
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2}

3. **Simplify the square root of the perfect square:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{11^2} = 11
   \]
   
   Therefore:
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = 11 \times \sqrt{2}

"Ako začnem, potrebujem pochopiť, čo sa od mňa chce. Máme číslo n, ktoré je kongruentné 2 modulo 7, t.j. n ≡ 2 mod 7. Potom treba nájsť zvyšok po delení výrazu (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) číslom 7.

Najprv si môžem predstaviť, že n môže byť zapisané ako 7k + 2, kde k je nejaké celé číslo. Toto je z dôvodu, že keď n delíme 7, zostane zvyšok 2. Takže n = 7k + 2.

Ďalej chcem vypočítať výraz (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Preto nahradiem n výrazom 7k + 2:

(n + 2) = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4
(n + 4) = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6
(n + 6) = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8

Teraz mám tri členy: 7k + 4, 7k + 6 a 7k + 8. Chcem vynásobiť tieto tri členy a následne zistiť, aký je ich zvyšok po delení 7.

Všimol si, že pri výpočte modulo 7, môžem každý člen osobitne vzal modulo 7, aby sa mi výpočet zjednodušil. Preto:

7k + 4 ≡ 4 mod 7
7k + 6 ≡ 6 mod 7
7k + 8 ≡ 8 mod 7, ale 8 mod 7 je 1, pretože 7*1=7, a 8-7=1.

Takže teraz môžem považovať výraz (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) modulo 7 ako 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7.

Vynásobíme tieto čísla:

4 * 6 = 24
24 * 1 = 24

Teraz musíme zistiť, aký je 24 mod 7. Víme, že 7*3=21, a 24-21=3. Preto 24 mod 7 je 3.

Takže zvyšok po delení (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) číslom 7 je 3.

"Okay, so I have this problem about a right-angled triangle ABC where angle B is 90 degrees. The question says that sin A equals 2 times cos A, and I need to find the value of tan A. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the sine and cosine of an angle are related to the sides of the triangle. Specifically, for angle A, sin A is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, and cos A is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. So, if I let the sides opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse to angle A be a, b, and c respectively, then:

sin A = a/c
cos A = b/c

The problem states that sin A = 2 cos A. So, substituting the expressions I have:

a/c = 2*(b/c)

Hmm, okay, so if I multiply both sides by c, I get:

a = 2b

That simplifies things a bit. So, the side opposite angle A is twice the length of the side adjacent to angle A. Now, I need to find tan A. I remember that tan A is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, so:

tan A = a/b

But from earlier, I found that a = 2b. So, substituting that into the equation for tan A:

tan A = (2b)/b

Simplifying that, the b's cancel out:

tan A = 2

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. So, if sin A = 2 cos A, then dividing both sides by cos A gives tan A = 2. Yeah, that makes sense because tan A is sin A over cos A. So, if sin A is twice cos A, then their ratio is 2. That seems correct.

Just to visualize, if angle A has sides a, b, c with a = 2b, then using Pythagoras' theorem, c would be sqrt(a² + b²) = sqrt((2b)² + b²) = sqrt(4b² + b²) = sqrt(5b²) = b*sqrt(5). So, sin A = a/c = 2b/(b*sqrt(5)) = 2/sqrt(5), and cos A = b/c = 1/sqrt(5). Then, sin A is indeed 2 cos A because 2/sqrt(5) is 2*(1/sqrt(5)). So, that checks out.

Therefore, tan A is 2. I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\tan A$ is \boxed{2}.
</think>

In a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we are given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

First, recall the definitions of sine and cosine in a right-angled triangle:
- \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{a}{c}\)
- \(\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{b}{c}\)

Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we substitute the expressions:
\[
\frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(c\) gives:
\[
a = 2b
\]

To find \(\tan A\), we use the definition:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Substituting \(a = 2b\) into the equation:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2b}{b} = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of a, b, and c for the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). The function has vertical asymptotes at x = a and x = b, and a horizontal asymptote at y = c. Then, I have to add them all together. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is a quadratic: x² - 5x - 14. Let me try to factor that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be 2 and -7 because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, yes, that works. Therefore, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator is zero when x = -2 or x = 7. That means the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a is -2 and b is 7. Got that part.

Now, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² - 5x - 14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c is 0.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y = 0. If they were equal, it would be the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree was higher, there wouldn't be a horizontal asymptote, but an oblique one. So, in this case, since 1 < 2, y = 0 is correct.

So, now I have a = -2, b = 7, and c = 0. I need to find a + b + c. Let me add them up: -2 + 7 + 0. That equals 5. So, the sum is 5.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Let me go through each step again.

1. Factor the denominator: x² - 5x - 14. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. 2 and -7: 2 * (-7) = -14, 2 + (-7) = -5. So, factors are (x + 2)(x - 7). Correct.

2. Vertical asymptotes at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2, b = 7. Correct.

3. Horizontal asymptote: degrees of numerator and denominator. Numerator is degree 1, denominator is degree 2. Since 1 < 2, horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0. Correct.

4. Sum: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. Yep, that seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the final answer should be 5.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{5}.
</think>

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7) \]

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which are at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). Thus, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

For the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1 and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( c = 0 \).

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \]

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for any 2-dimensional vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, or the induced norm, is the smallest such \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). So, I think I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.

First, let me recall that the operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is equal to the largest singular value of \( A \). Alternatively, it can also be found using the spectral radius if the matrix is diagonalizable, but I'm not sure if that's the case here. Maybe I should compute the singular values.

But wait, another approach is to use the definition of the operator norm. The operator norm \( ||A|| \) is the supremum of \( ||A\mathbf{v}|| \) over all vectors \( \mathbf{v} \) with \( ||\mathbf{v}|| = 1 \). So, essentially, I need to maximize \( ||A\mathbf{v}|| \) subject to \( ||\mathbf{v}|| = 1 \).

Let me write down the matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, for a vector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), the product \( A\mathbf{v} \) is:

\[
A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}
\]

The norm of this vector is:

\[
||A\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2}
\]

Simplify that:

\[
= \sqrt{(4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2) + 4y^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}
\]

Now, since we're looking for the maximum of this expression when \( ||\mathbf{v}|| = 1 \), which is \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). So, we can set up the optimization problem:

Maximize \( f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \) subject to \( g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \).

This is a constrained optimization problem, so I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. The Lagrangian is:

\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 - \lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 1)
\]

Taking partial derivatives:

1. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 8x + 12y - 2\lambda x = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 12x + 26y - 2\lambda y = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = -(x^2 + y^2 - 1) = 0 \)

So, from the first equation:

\( 8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \)
Simplify:
\( 8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \)
\( 8x - 2\lambda x + 12y = 0 \)
\( x(8 - 2\lambda) + 12y = 0 \) --- (1)

From the second equation:

\( 12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \)
Simplify:
\( 12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \)
\( 12x + 26y - 2\lambda y = 0 \)
\( 12x + y(26 - 2\lambda) = 0 \) --- (2)

Now, we have two equations:

1. \( x(8 - 2\lambda) + 12y = 0 \)
2. \( 12x + y(26 - 2\lambda) = 0 \)

Let me write this as a system:

\[
\begin{cases}
(8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0 \\
12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0
\end{cases}
\]

This is a homogeneous system, and for non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

So, the determinant is:

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\
12 & 26 - 2\lambda
\end{vmatrix}
= (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - (12)(12)
\]

Let me compute this:

First, expand \( (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) \):

\( 8*26 = 208 \)
\( 8*(-2\lambda) = -16\lambda \)
\( (-2\lambda)*26 = -52\lambda \)
\( (-2\lambda)*(-2\lambda) = 4\lambda^2 \)

So, altogether:

\( 208 - 16\lambda - 52\lambda + 4\lambda^2 = 208 - 68\lambda + 4\lambda^2 \)

Subtract \( 12*12 = 144 \):

So determinant is:

\( 208 - 68\lambda + 4\lambda^2 - 144 = (208 - 144) - 68\lambda + 4\lambda^2 = 64 - 68\lambda + 4\lambda^2 \)

Set determinant equal to zero:

\( 4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 64 = 0 \)

Divide both sides by 4:

\( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \)

Now, solve for \( \lambda \):

Quadratic equation: \( \lambda^2 -17\lambda +16 =0 \)

Using quadratic formula:

\( \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4*1*16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2} \)

So, two solutions:

1. \( \lambda = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( \lambda = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

So, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1. Since we're looking for the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \), which is \( ||A\mathbf{v}||^2 \), the maximum occurs at the largest eigenvalue, which is 16. Therefore, the maximum value of \( ||A\mathbf{v}|| \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Wait, hold on. Is that correct? Because \( f(x, y) = ||A\mathbf{v}||^2 \), so the maximum of \( f \) is 16, so the maximum of \( ||A\mathbf{v}|| \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). Therefore, the operator norm \( ||A|| = 4 \). So, the smallest such \( C \) is 4.

But let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the eigenvalues. Because in the Lagrangian, we set up the equations for the extrema, and the eigenvalues correspond to the extrema of the Rayleigh quotient, which in this case is \( \frac{f(x, y)}{x^2 + y^2} \). Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), the maximum of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed the largest eigenvalue, which is 16, so the norm is 4.

Alternatively, another way to compute the operator norm is to compute the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). Let me try that method to confirm.

Compute \( A^T A \):

\( A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

So,

\( A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & -6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \)

Wait, let me compute that step by step:

First row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 2*2 + 0*0 = 4 \)

First row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So, \( A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \)

Now, to find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \), we solve the characteristic equation:

\( \det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0 \)

So,

\[
\begin{vmatrix}
4 - \lambda & 6 \\
6 & 13 - \lambda
\end{vmatrix}
= (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = 0
\]

Compute:

\( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) = 52 - 4\lambda -13\lambda + \lambda^2 = \lambda^2 -17\lambda +52 \)

Subtract 36:

\( \lambda^2 -17\lambda +52 -36 = \lambda^2 -17\lambda +16 = 0 \)

Which is the same quadratic as before! So, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1. Therefore, the largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the smallest such \( C \) is 4.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me test with a specific vector. Let's take the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 16. Let's find it.

From the system earlier, when \( \lambda = 16 \):

From equation (1):

\( (8 - 32)x + 12y = 0 \)
\( (-24)x + 12y = 0 \)
Simplify: \( -24x + 12y = 0 \) => \( -2x + y = 0 \) => \( y = 2x \)

So, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \). Let's take \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \). But wait, we need to normalize it because the norm is 1.

Compute \( ||\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5} \). So, the unit vector is \( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \).

Now, compute \( A\mathbf{v} \):

\( A \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2*1 + 3*2 \\ 0*1 + (-2)*2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ 0 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \)

Compute the norm:

\( ||A\mathbf{v}|| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 16} = \sqrt{80} = 4\sqrt{5} \)

But since \( \mathbf{v} \) was not a unit vector, let's compute \( ||A\mathbf{v}|| / ||\mathbf{v}|| \):

\( ||A\mathbf{v}|| / ||\mathbf{v}|| = (4\sqrt{5}) / \sqrt{5} = 4 \). So, that's consistent with our earlier result.

Therefore, the operator norm is indeed 4, so the smallest \( C \) is 4.

First, I remember that complex numbers satisfying \( z^n = 1 \) are called roots of unity. In this case, since it's \( z^5 = 1 \), these are the 5th roots of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). I know that these roots can be expressed in the form \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

Let me consider \( z + z^{-1} \) and \( z^2 + z^{-2} \) separately.

Similarly, \( z^2 + z^{-2} \) would be \( 2\cos(2\theta) \). So, if I can find \( \theta \), I can compute these cosine terms.

Since \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \), the argument \( \theta \) is \( 2\pi k/5 \). Therefore, \( z + z^{-1} = 2\cos(2\pi k/5) \) and \( z^2 + z^{-2} = 2\cos(4\pi k/5) \). So, the entire expression becomes \( 2\cos(2\pi k/5) + 2\cos(4\pi k/5) \).

Hmm, so I need to compute \( 2\cos(2\pi k/5) + 2\cos(4\pi k/5) \). Let me factor out the 2 to make it \( 2[\cos(2\pi k/5) + \cos(4\pi k/5)] \). Maybe I can use a trigonometric identity to combine these cosines.

I recall that \( \cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right) \). Let me apply this identity to \( \cos(2\pi k/5) + \cos(4\pi k/5) \).

Let \( A = 4\pi k/5 \) and \( B = 2\pi k/5 \). Then, \( \frac{A+B}{2} = \frac{6\pi k/5}{2} = 3\pi k/5 \) and \( \frac{A-B}{2} = \frac{2\pi k/5}{2} = \pi k/5 \). So, the sum becomes \( 2\cos(3\pi k/5)\cos(\pi k/5) \).

Therefore, the entire expression is \( 2 \times 2\cos(3\pi k/5)\cos(\pi k/5) = 4\cos(3\pi k/5)\cos(\pi k/5) \). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another way to approach this.

Alternatively, I remember that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. That is, \( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we can write \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). Maybe I can use this to find the value of \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \), but in our problem, we have \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} \).

Wait, since \( z^5 = 1 \), \( z^{-1} = z^4 \) and \( z^{-2} = z^3 \). So, \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \). Which is exactly \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \), which we know is equal to -1. So, does that mean the expression is equal to -1?

Wait, hold on. Let me verify that. If \( z^5 = 1 \), then \( z^{-1} = z^{4} \) and \( z^{-2} = z^{3} \). So, substituting, \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \). And since \( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \), subtracting 1 from both sides gives \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). Therefore, \( z + z^{-1} + z^2 + z^{-2} = -1 \).

Wait, so is the answer just -1? That seems too straightforward. Let me check with a specific value of \( z \) to make sure.

Let me take \( k = 1 \), so \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \). Then, \( z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 \) should be equal to \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \). Let me compute this numerically.

First, compute \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \approx \cos(72^\circ) + i\sin(72^\circ) \approx 0.3090 + 0.9511i \).

Then, \( z^2 = e^{4\pi i /5} \approx \cos(144^\circ) + i\sin(144^\circ) \approx -0.8090 + 0.5878i \).

\( z^3 = e^{6\pi i /5} \approx \cos(216^\circ) + i\sin(216^\circ) \approx -0.8090 - 0.5878i \).

\( z^4 = e^{8\pi i /5} \approx \cos(288^\circ) + i\sin(288^\circ) \approx 0.3090 - 0.9511i \).

Now, adding them up:

\( z + z^4 = (0.3090 + 0.9511i) + (0.3090 - 0.9511i) = 0.6180 \).

\( z^2 + z^3 = (-0.8090 + 0.5878i) + (-0.8090 - 0.5878i) = -1.6180 \).

Adding these two results: \( 0.6180 + (-1.6180) = -1 \). So, yes, it does equal -1. That seems to confirm it.

Alternatively, let me try \( k = 2 \), so \( z = e^{4\pi i /5} \approx -0.8090 + 0.5878i \).

Then, \( 1/z = e^{-4\pi i /5} = e^{6\pi i /5} \approx -0.8090 - 0.5878i \).

\( z^2 = e^{8\pi i /5} \approx 0.3090 - 0.9511i \).

\( 1/z^2 = e^{-8\pi i /5} = e^{2\pi i /5} \approx 0.3090 + 0.9511i \).

Adding them up:

\( z + 1/z = (-0.8090 + 0.5878i) + (-0.8090 - 0.5878i) = -1.6180 \).

\( z^2 + 1/z^2 = (0.3090 - 0.9511i) + (0.3090 + 0.9511i) = 0.6180 \).

Adding these two results: \( -1.6180 + 0.6180 = -1 \). Again, it equals -1.

So, it seems that regardless of the value of \( k \), the expression \( z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 \) equals -1. Therefore, the answer should be -1.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this without plugging in specific values. Maybe using the properties of roots of unity.

We know that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. So, \( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \). Therefore, \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). But in our problem, we have \( z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), \( 1/z = z^4 \) and \( 1/z^2 = z^3 \). So, substituting, we get \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \), which is exactly \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \), which equals -1. So, that's another way to see it.

Therefore, the value is indeed -1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-1}
</think>

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, excluding 1. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be written as \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we consider \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

We need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Recognizing that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \), we rewrite the expression as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

We know from the properties of roots of unity that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero:
\[ 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0. \]
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1. \]

Thus, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) simplifies to \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \), which equals -1.

"Okay, so I have this problem about a cylindrical tank being filled with water. Let me try to understand what's given and what I need to find. 

First, the tank is a right circular cylinder, which means it has two circular bases and a straight side. It's being filled with water at a rate of 20π cubic meters per hour. As the tank fills up, the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. I need to find the radius of the tank in meters and express it in the simplest radical form.

Hmm, let's break this down. I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the tank is being filled, the volume is increasing over time, and the height of the water is also increasing.

The problem gives me two rates: the rate at which the volume is increasing (dV/dt) and the rate at which the height is increasing (dh/dt). I think I can use related rates to solve this problem. 

So, let's write down what we know:

- dV/dt = 20π m³/hour
- dh/dt = 4 m/hour

We need to find r, the radius of the tank.

Since the volume of the cylinder is V = πr²h, if I differentiate both sides with respect to time t, I can relate the rates. Let me do that.

Differentiating V with respect to t:

dV/dt = d/dt (πr²h)

Since r is a constant (the radius doesn't change as the tank is being filled), the derivative simplifies. So, dV/dt = πr² dh/dt.

Wait, is that right? Let me make sure. If r is constant, then yes, the derivative of πr²h with respect to t is πr² times dh/dt. So, that gives me:

dV/dt = πr² (dh/dt)

I can plug in the known values here. We know dV/dt is 20π and dh/dt is 4. So:

20π = πr² * 4

Hmm, okay, let's solve for r². First, I can divide both sides by π to simplify:

20 = r² * 4

Then, divide both sides by 4:

r² = 20 / 4
r² = 5

So, to find r, I take the square root of both sides:

r = √5

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.

1. Start with the volume formula for a cylinder: V = πr²h.
2. Differentiate both sides with respect to time t: dV/dt = πr² dh/dt.
3. Plug in the given rates: 20π = πr² * 4.
4. Simplify: 20 = 4r² => r² = 5 => r = √5.

Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes here. The radius is √5 meters. 

Just to make sure, let me think about the units. The volume rate is in cubic meters per hour, and the height rate is in meters per hour. When I divide 20π by 4, I get 5, which is unitless because both numerator and denominator have units that cancel out (m³/h divided by m/h gives m²). Then taking the square root gives meters, which is consistent with the radius being in meters. So the units check out.

I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, the radius of the tank is √5 meters.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the tank is \boxed{\sqrt{5}} meters.
</think>

Given a right circular cylindrical tank being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour, we need to find the radius of the tank.

First, we use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, \(V = \pi r^2 h\). Differentiating both sides with respect to time \(t\), we get:

\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

We know the rates:
- \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\)
- \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\)

Substituting these values into the equation:

\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

Simplifying by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):

\[
20 = 4r^2
\]

Solving for \(r^2\):

\[
r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, that means for every y-value, there should be some x such that f(x) = y. So, the function needs to be surjective, right? Or at least, its range should cover all real numbers.

Let me think about the function. It's a piecewise function with two parts: a quadratic and a linear part. The quadratic part is ax² for x ≥ a, and the linear part is ax + 2a for x < a. So, the function changes its behavior at x = a.

First, I should probably sketch the graph or at least understand how it behaves. Let's consider the two cases separately.

For x ≥ a, f(x) = ax². This is a parabola opening upwards if a > 0, or downwards if a < 0. The vertex of this parabola is at (a, f(a)) = (a, a*(a)²) = (a, a³). So, the vertex is at (a, a³).

For x < a, f(x) = ax + 2a. This is a straight line with slope a and y-intercept 2a. So, when x approaches a from the left, the value of f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a.

Now, at x = a, the function is defined by the quadratic part, so f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. So, the function is continuous at x = a only if the left-hand limit equals the right-hand limit. Let's check that.

Left-hand limit as x approaches a from below: lim x→a⁻ f(x) = a*a + 2a = a² + 2a.

Right-hand limit as x approaches a from above: lim x→a⁺ f(x) = a*(a)² = a³.

So, for the function to be continuous at x = a, we need a² + 2a = a³. Let's solve this equation:

a³ - a² - 2a = 0

Factor out an a:

a(a² - a - 2) = 0

So, a = 0 or a² - a - 2 = 0.

Solving a² - a - 2 = 0:

a = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2

So, a = 2 or a = -1.

Therefore, the function is continuous at x = a only when a = 0, 2, or -1.

But the problem doesn't specify continuity, so maybe it's not necessary. However, if the function isn't continuous, there might be a jump discontinuity at x = a, which could affect whether every horizontal line intersects the graph.

Wait, the question is about the graph intersecting every horizontal line at least once. So, if there's a jump discontinuity, we might have a gap in the graph, meaning some horizontal lines might not intersect. So, to ensure that every horizontal line intersects, the function must be continuous? Or at least, the ranges of the two pieces must cover all real numbers without any gaps.

Let me think. If the function is not continuous, there could be a gap between the two pieces. For example, if the left-hand limit is higher than the right-hand limit, then there's a jump downward, creating a gap. Similarly, if the right-hand limit is higher, there's a jump upward. Either way, there might be a missing interval in the range.

Therefore, to ensure that the function's range is all real numbers, the function must be continuous, or the ranges of the two pieces must overlap or connect in such a way that there are no gaps.

So, maybe the function needs to be continuous? Or maybe not necessarily, but the ranges must cover all y-values.

Let me analyze the ranges of both pieces.

First, for x ≥ a, f(x) = ax². The range of this depends on the value of a.

If a > 0, then ax² is a parabola opening upwards. The minimum value is at x = a, which is a³. So, the range is [a³, ∞).

If a < 0, then ax² is a parabola opening downwards. The maximum value is at x = a, which is a³. So, the range is (-∞, a³].

For x < a, f(x) = ax + 2a. This is a linear function. Its range depends on the slope.

If a > 0, the line has a positive slope, so as x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches -∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a² + 2a.

If a < 0, the line has a negative slope, so as x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches ∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a² + 2a.

So, let's consider different cases for a.

Case 1: a > 0.

In this case, the quadratic part has range [a³, ∞), and the linear part has range (-∞, a² + 2a). So, for the entire function's range to cover all real numbers, the maximum of the linear part (which is a² + 2a) must be greater than or equal to the minimum of the quadratic part (which is a³). Otherwise, there will be a gap between a³ and a² + 2a.

So, we need a² + 2a ≥ a³.

Let's write this inequality:

a² + 2a ≥ a³

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0

Factor:

a(a² - a - 2) ≤ 0

We can factor the quadratic:

a² - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1)

So, the inequality becomes:

a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0

We need to find the values of a where this product is less than or equal to zero.

Let's consider the critical points: a = -1, 0, 2.

We can make a sign chart:

- For a < -1: Let's pick a = -2. Then (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = (-2)(4) = -8 ≤ 0. So, satisfies.

- For -1 < a < 0: Let's pick a = -0.5. Then (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = (-0.5)(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

- For 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1. Then (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 ≤ 0. Satisfies.

- For a > 2: Let's pick a = 3. Then (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

So, the inequality a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0 holds when a ≤ -1 or 0 ≤ a ≤ 2.

But in this case, we are considering a > 0, so the relevant interval is 0 < a ≤ 2.

Therefore, for a > 0, the function's range will cover all real numbers if a ≤ 2.

But wait, when a = 2, let's check:

Quadratic part: f(x) = 2x² for x ≥ 2. Its minimum is at x=2, which is 2*(2)^2 = 8.

Linear part: f(x) = 2x + 4 for x < 2. As x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 2*2 + 4 = 8. So, the function is continuous at x=2, and the linear part goes to -∞ as x approaches -∞. So, the range is (-∞, ∞). So, yes, every horizontal line intersects.

If a is less than 2, say a=1, then quadratic part has minimum at 1, and linear part approaches 1 + 2 = 3 as x approaches 1 from the left. So, the linear part goes to -∞, and the quadratic part goes to ∞. But the linear part's maximum is 3, and the quadratic part's minimum is 1. So, the function's range is (-∞, 3] ∪ [1, ∞). Wait, that leaves a gap between 1 and 3? No, because 3 is greater than 1, so actually, the ranges overlap. Wait, no, the linear part goes up to 3, and the quadratic part starts at 1. So, the function's range is (-∞, 3] ∪ [1, ∞). But since 3 > 1, the union is (-∞, ∞). So, actually, there is no gap. Wait, that's interesting.

Wait, if a=1, the linear part goes from -∞ up to 3, and the quadratic part starts at 1 and goes to ∞. So, the function's range is (-∞, ∞) because the linear part covers up to 3, and the quadratic part covers from 1 onwards, overlapping between 1 and 3. So, no gap.

Wait, but if a is less than 2, say a=1.5, then the linear part approaches a² + 2a = (2.25) + 3 = 5.25, and the quadratic part starts at a³ = 3.375. So, the linear part goes up to 5.25, and the quadratic part starts at 3.375. So, the function's range is (-∞, 5.25] ∪ [3.375, ∞). Again, overlapping between 3.375 and 5.25, so the entire range is (-∞, ∞).

Wait, so maybe for a > 0, as long as a ≤ 2, the function's range is all real numbers. Because the linear part goes to -∞, and the quadratic part goes to ∞, and their overlapping regions cover the gap.

But when a > 2, let's say a=3. Then the linear part approaches a² + 2a = 9 + 6 = 15, and the quadratic part starts at a³ = 27. So, the linear part goes up to 15, and the quadratic part starts at 27. So, the function's range is (-∞, 15] ∪ [27, ∞). There's a gap between 15 and 27, so horizontal lines between 15 and 27 won't intersect the graph. Therefore, the function doesn't cover all real numbers.

So, for a > 2, the function's range is not all real numbers. Therefore, the maximum a for which the function's range is all real numbers is a=2.

But wait, let's check a=2. At a=2, the function is continuous at x=2, as we saw earlier. The linear part approaches 8, and the quadratic part starts at 8. So, the function is continuous, and the range is (-∞, ∞). So, a=2 is acceptable.

What about a=0? If a=0, the function becomes:

f(x) = 0 when x ≥ 0,

f(x) = 0 + 0 = 0 when x < 0.

So, the function is constant zero. Its range is just {0}, which doesn't cover all real numbers. So, a=0 is not acceptable.

What about a negative a? Let's consider a < 0.

Case 2: a < 0.

In this case, the quadratic part f(x) = ax² for x ≥ a. Since a is negative, this is a downward-opening parabola. The vertex is at (a, a³). Since a is negative, a³ is also negative. The range of the quadratic part is (-∞, a³].

The linear part f(x) = ax + 2a for x < a. Since a is negative, the slope is negative, so as x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches ∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a² + 2a.

So, the linear part has range [a² + 2a, ∞).

Wait, because as x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches ∞, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a² + 2a. Since a is negative, a² is positive, and 2a is negative. So, a² + 2a could be positive or negative depending on the value of a.

But the quadratic part has range (-∞, a³], and the linear part has range [a² + 2a, ∞). So, for the entire function's range to cover all real numbers, the maximum of the quadratic part (which is a³) must be greater than or equal to the minimum of the linear part (which is a² + 2a). Otherwise, there will be a gap between a² + 2a and a³.

So, we need a³ ≥ a² + 2a.

Let's write this inequality:

a³ - a² - 2a ≥ 0

Factor:

a(a² - a - 2) ≥ 0

Again, factor the quadratic:

a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≥ 0

We need to find where this product is greater than or equal to zero.

Critical points are a = -1, 0, 2.

Sign chart:

- For a < -1: Let's pick a = -2. (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = (-2)(4) = -8 < 0. Doesn't satisfy.

- For -1 < a < 0: Let's pick a = -0.5. (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = (-0.5)(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. Satisfies.

- For 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1. (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (","[1, '1. (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1)']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center and \( r \) is the radius. So, I need to rewrite the given equation into this standard form by completing the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

Let me group the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms together:
\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0 \]

Now, I'll complete the square for the \( x \) terms. The coefficient of \( x \) is -10. To complete the square, I take half of -10, which is -5, and then square it to get 25. So, I add and subtract 25 inside the equation.

Similarly, for the \( y \) terms, the coefficient is 6. Half of 6 is 3, and squaring that gives 9. So, I add and subtract 9 for the \( y \) terms.

Let me write that out:
\[ (x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9) + c = 0 \]

Simplifying this, it becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constants:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \]

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check my steps again. I think I might have messed up the signs when moving the constants to the other side.

Starting over, after completing the square:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

So, moving the constants to the other side:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 25 + 9 - c \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Ah, that makes more sense. So, the equation is now in standard form, where the right-hand side is \( r^2 \). Therefore, \( r^2 = 34 - c \).

We are told that the radius \( r \) is 1. So, substituting \( r = 1 \):
\[ 1^2 = 34 - c \]
\[ 1 = 34 - c \]

Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Wait, let me double-check. If \( r^2 = 34 - c \) and \( r = 1 \), then \( 1 = 34 - c \), so \( c = 34 - 1 = 33 \). That seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in completing the square, let me verify:

Original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

Completing the square for \( x \):
Take \( x^2 - 10x \), add \( (10/2)^2 = 25 \), so \( x^2 - 10x + 25 = (x - 5)^2 \).

For \( y \):
Take \( y^2 + 6y \), add \( (6/2)^2 = 9 \), so \( y^2 + 6y + 9 = (y + 3)^2 \).

So, adding 25 and 9 to both sides:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 25 + 9 - c \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Yes, that's correct. So, \( r^2 = 34 - c \). Since \( r = 1 \), \( r^2 = 1 \), so \( 1 = 34 - c \), leading to \( c = 33 \).

I think that's solid. So, the value of \( c \) should be 33.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( c \) is \boxed{33}.
</think>

To find the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we start by rewriting the equation in standard form by completing the square.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

We group the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms together:
\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms:
- For \( x^2 - 10x \), we add and subtract 25: \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \)
- For \( y^2 + 6y \), we add and subtract 9: \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \)

This gives us:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combining the constants:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

Rewriting this in standard form:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Since the radius \( r \) is 1, we have \( r^2 = 1 \). Therefore:
\[ 1 = 34 - c \]

Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \boxed{33}.","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The parameter λ controls the behavior of the function. For different values of λ, the function can have fixed points, periodic points, and so on.

The problem is asking for λ values where there's a point x that isn't a fixed point (so f(x) ≠ x), but when you apply f twice, you get back to x. That is, f(f(x)) = x. So, x is a periodic point of period 2, but not a fixed point. So, essentially, we're looking for λ where the function f has a 2-cycle.

I remember that for the logistic map, the period-doubling route to chaos starts with the first bifurcation at λ = 3, where the fixed point becomes unstable and a 2-cycle appears. But I need to verify this and see if that's the case here.

Let me start by finding the fixed points of f. Fixed points satisfy f(x) = x. So, let's set up the equation:

λx(1 - x) = x

Let me rearrange this:

λx(1 - x) - x = 0

x(λ(1 - x) - 1) = 0

So, the solutions are x = 0 and x = (λ - 1)/λ. Wait, let me check that:

Wait, expanding λx(1 - x) = x:

λx - λx² = x

Bring all terms to one side:

λx - λx² - x = 0

Factor x:

x(λ - λx - 1) = 0

So, x = 0 or λ - λx - 1 = 0

Solving for x in the second equation:

λ - λx - 1 = 0

-λx = 1 - λ

x = (λ - 1)/λ

Wait, that seems correct. So, fixed points are x = 0 and x = (λ - 1)/λ.

But wait, x must be in [0,1]. So, let's see when (λ - 1)/λ is in [0,1].

Compute (λ - 1)/λ:

(λ - 1)/λ = 1 - 1/λ

So, 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. Let's see:

1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 ⇒ 1 ≥ 1/λ ⇒ λ ≥ 1

And 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 ⇒ -1/λ ≤ 0, which is always true since λ > 0.

So, for λ ≥ 1, the fixed point x = (λ - 1)/λ is in [0,1]. For λ < 1, the only fixed point in [0,1] is x = 0.

Okay, so for λ ≥ 1, we have two fixed points: 0 and (λ - 1)/λ. For λ < 1, only x = 0 is a fixed point.

Now, the problem is about points x where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So, these are points of period 2, not fixed points.

To find such points, we can set up the equation f(f(x)) = x and solve for x, then ensure that x is not a fixed point.

So, let's compute f(f(x)):

f(f(x)) = f(λx(1 - x)) = λ[λx(1 - x)][1 - λx(1 - x)]

So, f(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)]

Set this equal to x:

λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)] = x

Let me denote y = λx(1 - x) for simplicity. Then, f(f(x)) = λy(1 - y). So, the equation becomes:

λy(1 - y) = x

But y = λx(1 - x), so substituting back:

λ[λx(1 - x)][1 - λx(1 - x)] = x

Let me expand this:

First, compute y = λx(1 - x) = λx - λx²

Then, 1 - y = 1 - λx + λx²

So, f(f(x)) = λy(1 - y) = λ(λx - λx²)(1 - λx + λx²)

Multiply this out:

First, multiply (λx - λx²) and (1 - λx + λx²):

Let me compute (a - b)(c - d + e) where a = λx, b = λx², c = 1, d = λx, e = λx².

Wait, maybe it's better to just multiply term by term.

(λx - λx²)(1 - λx + λx²) = λx*(1) + λx*(-λx) + λx*(λx²) - λx²*(1) - λx²*(-λx) + λx²*(λx²)

Compute each term:

= λx - λ²x² + λ²x³ - λx² + λ²x³ - λ²x⁴

Combine like terms:

- λx term: λx

- x² terms: -λ²x² - λx² = - (λ² + λ)x²

- x³ terms: λ²x³ + λ²x³ = 2λ²x³

- x⁴ term: -λ²x⁴

So, overall:

λx - (λ² + λ)x² + 2λ²x³ - λ²x⁴

Now, multiply by λ:

f(f(x)) = λ * [λx - (λ² + λ)x² + 2λ²x³ - λ²x⁴] = λ²x - λ(λ² + λ)x² + 2λ³x³ - λ³x⁴

So, f(f(x)) = λ²x - λ³x² - λ²x² + 2λ³x³ - λ³x⁴

Combine like terms:

- x term: λ²x

- x² terms: -λ³x² - λ²x² = - (λ³ + λ²)x²

- x³ term: 2λ³x³

- x⁴ term: -λ³x⁴

So, f(f(x)) = λ²x - (λ³ + λ²)x² + 2λ³x³ - λ³x⁴

Set this equal to x:

λ²x - (λ³ + λ²)x² + 2λ³x³ - λ³x⁴ = x

Bring all terms to one side:

λ²x - (λ³ + λ²)x² + 2λ³x³ - λ³x⁴ - x = 0

Factor x:

x[λ² - (λ³ + λ²)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1] = 0

So, the solutions are x = 0, which is a fixed point, and the solutions to the cubic equation inside the brackets:

λ² - (λ³ + λ²)x + 2λ³x² - λ³x³ - 1 = 0

Let me rearrange this equation:

-λ³x³ + 2λ³x² - (λ³ + λ²)x + (λ² - 1) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it a bit cleaner:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

So, the equation is:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

This is a cubic equation in x. We can factor this equation to find its roots.

Let me try to factor this cubic. Maybe we can factor out some terms.

Looking at the coefficients:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1)

Let me group terms:

(λ³x³ - 2λ³x²) + [(λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1)]

Factor λ³x² from the first group:

λ³x²(x - 2) + (λ²(λ + 1)x - (λ² - 1)) = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe try to factor by grouping differently.

Alternatively, perhaps factor out (x - 1) or something similar.

Let me test x = 1 as a root:

Plug x = 1 into the cubic:

λ³(1) - 2λ³(1) + (λ³ + λ²)(1) - (λ² - 1) =

λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³ + λ² - λ² + 1 =

(λ³ - 2λ³ + λ³) + (λ² - λ²) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0

So, x = 1 is not a root.

How about x = 0? Plugging x = 0:

0 - 0 + 0 - (λ² - 1) = -(λ² - 1) = 1 - λ²

Which is zero only if λ² = 1, i.e., λ = 1 or λ = -1. But λ is between 0 and 4, so only λ = 1. So, x = 0 is a root only when λ = 1.

But in our case, we are looking for roots other than x = 0, since x = 0 is a fixed point.

Alternatively, maybe x = (λ - 1)/λ is a root? Let's test that.

Let me denote x = (λ - 1)/λ. Let's plug into the cubic:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = 0

Compute each term:

x = (λ - 1)/λ

x² = (λ - 1)² / λ²

x³ = (λ - 1)³ / λ³

So,

λ³ * (λ - 1)³ / λ³ = (λ - 1)³

-2λ³ * (λ - 1)² / λ² = -2λ(λ - 1)²

(λ³ + λ²) * (λ - 1)/λ = (λ²(λ + 1))(λ - 1)/λ = λ(λ + 1)(λ - 1)

- (λ² - 1) = - (λ - 1)(λ + 1)

So, putting it all together:

(λ - 1)³ - 2λ(λ - 1)² + λ(λ + 1)(λ - 1) - (λ - 1)(λ + 1) = 0

Factor out (λ - 1):

(λ - 1)[(λ - 1)² - 2λ(λ - 1) + λ(λ + 1) - (λ + 1)] = 0

Simplify inside the brackets:

First term: (λ - 1)² = λ² - 2λ + 1

Second term: -2λ(λ - 1) = -2λ² + 2λ

Third term: λ(λ + 1) = λ² + λ

Fourth term: - (λ + 1) = -λ -1

So, combine all:

(λ² - 2λ + 1) + (-2λ² + 2λ) + (λ² + λ) + (-λ -1)

Compute term by term:

λ² - 2λ + 1 -2λ² + 2λ + λ² + λ - λ -1

Combine like terms:

λ² -2λ² + λ² = 0

-2λ + 2λ + λ - λ = 0

1 -1 = 0

So, everything cancels out, leaving 0. Therefore, x = (λ - 1)/λ is indeed a root of the cubic equation.

Therefore, the cubic can be factored as (x - (λ - 1)/λ)(quadratic) = 0

So, let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Let me write the cubic as:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1) = (x - (λ - 1)/λ)(Ax² + Bx + C)

We need to find A, B, C such that when we multiply out, we get the original cubic.

Let me denote x0 = (λ - 1)/λ

So, (x - x0)(Ax² + Bx + C) = Ax³ + Bx² + Cx - Ax²x0 - Bx x0 - Cx0

= Ax³ + (B - Ax0)x² + (C - Bx0)x - Cx0

Set this equal to the original cubic:

λ³x³ - 2λ³x² + (λ³ + λ²)x - (λ² - 1)

So, equate coefficients:

A = λ³

B - Ax0 = -2λ³

C - Bx0 = λ³ + λ²

- Cx0 = -(λ² - 1)

From the last equation:

- Cx0 = -(λ² - 1) ⇒ Cx0 = λ² - 1 ⇒ C = (λ² - 1)/x0

But x0 = (λ - 1)/λ, so:

C = (λ² - 1) / [(λ - 1)/λ] = λ(λ² - 1)/(λ - 1) = λ(λ - 1)(λ + 1)/(λ - 1) = λ(λ + 1)

So, C = λ(λ + 1)

Now, from the third equation:

C - Bx0 = λ³ + λ²

We have C = λ(λ + 1), so:

λ(λ + 1) - Bx0 = λ³ + λ²

Thus,

- Bx0 = λ³ + λ² - λ(λ + 1) = λ³ + λ","[1, '1']","(3,4]",[],False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive angle θ such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The numerator and denominator both have a bunch of trigonometric terms, so I think I need to simplify them somehow. Maybe using some trigonometric identities?

Let me write down the expression again to make it clearer:

tan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]

Hmm, both the numerator and the denominator have products of sines and cosines. I remember that there are product-to-sum identities that might help here. Let me recall them:

cos A cos B = [cos(A+B) + cos(A-B)] / 2

sin A sin B = [cos(A+B) - cos(A-B)] / 2

sin A cos B = [sin(A+B) + sin(A-B)] / 2

cos A sin B = [sin(A+B) - sin(A-B)] / 2

Okay, so maybe I can apply these identities to each term in the numerator and denominator.

Starting with the numerator:

cos5° cos20°: Using the identity, this becomes [cos(25°) + cos(-15°)] / 2. Since cosine is even, cos(-15°) = cos15°, so it's [cos25° + cos15°]/2.

cos35° cos50°: Similarly, this is [cos85° + cos(-15°)] / 2, which is [cos85° + cos15°]/2.

-sin5° sin20°: Using the identity, this is -[cos25° - cos(-15°)] / 2. Again, cos(-15°) is cos15°, so it becomes -[cos25° - cos15°]/2 = [-cos25° + cos15°]/2.

-sin35° sin50°: Similarly, this is -[cos85° - cos(-15°)] / 2 = -[cos85° - cos15°]/2 = [-cos85° + cos15°]/2.

So putting all these together, the numerator becomes:

[cos25° + cos15°]/2 + [cos85° + cos15°]/2 + [-cos25° + cos15°]/2 + [-cos85° + cos15°]/2

Let me combine these terms:

First, let's distribute the 1/2:

(1/2)(cos25° + cos15° + cos85° + cos15° - cos25° + cos15° - cos85° + cos15°)

Now, let's see which terms cancel or combine:

cos25° - cos25° = 0

cos85° - cos85° = 0

So we're left with cos15° + cos15° + cos15° + cos15°, which is 4 cos15°

So the numerator simplifies to (1/2)(4 cos15°) = 2 cos15°

Wait, hold on, let me check that again. Each term is multiplied by 1/2, so adding four cos15° terms each multiplied by 1/2 would be (4 * 1/2) cos15° = 2 cos15°. Yeah, that's correct.

Okay, so numerator is 2 cos15°. Nice.

Now, moving on to the denominator:

sin5° cos20°: Using the identity, this is [sin25° + sin(-15°)] / 2. Since sin(-15°) = -sin15°, so it's [sin25° - sin15°]/2.

-sin35° cos50°: Using the identity, this is -[sin85° + sin(-15°)] / 2 = -[sin85° - sin15°]/2 = [-sin85° + sin15°]/2.

cos5° sin20°: Using the identity, this is [sin25° - sin(-15°)] / 2 = [sin25° + sin15°]/2.

-cos35° sin50°: Using the identity, this is -[sin85° - sin(-15°)] / 2 = -[sin85° + sin15°]/2 = [-sin85° - sin15°]/2.

So putting all these together, the denominator becomes:

[sin25° - sin15°]/2 + [-sin85° + sin15°]/2 + [sin25° + sin15°]/2 + [-sin85° - sin15°]/2

Again, let's distribute the 1/2:

(1/2)(sin25° - sin15° - sin85° + sin15° + sin25° + sin15° - sin85° - sin15°)

Now, let's combine like terms:

sin25° + sin25° = 2 sin25°

-sin15° + sin15° + sin15° - sin15° = 0

-sin85° - sin85° = -2 sin85°

So the denominator simplifies to (1/2)(2 sin25° - 2 sin85°) = (1/2)(2)(sin25° - sin85°) = sin25° - sin85°

Hmm, okay. So denominator is sin25° - sin85°. Let me see if I can simplify that further.

I remember that sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. Let me apply that identity.

So sin25° - sin85° = 2 cos[(25+85)/2] sin[(25-85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°)

Since sin(-30°) = -sin30° = -1/2, so this becomes 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°

So denominator is -cos55°

Wait, let me double-check that:

sin25° - sin85° = 2 cos[(25+85)/2] sin[(25-85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°) = 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°. Yes, that's correct.

So denominator is -cos55°, which is equal to -cos55°. Alternatively, since cos55° is positive, it's just negative of that.

So now, putting it all together, tan θ = numerator / denominator = (2 cos15°) / (-cos55°)

So tan θ = -2 cos15° / cos55°

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can simplify this further.

First, note that cos55° is equal to sin35°, because cos(90° - x) = sinx. So cos55° = sin35°. So we can write:

tan θ = -2 cos15° / sin35°

Alternatively, maybe express cos15° in terms of sine? Let's see.

cos15° = sin75°, since cosx = sin(90° - x). So cos15° = sin75°. So tan θ = -2 sin75° / sin35°

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe express both in terms of sine or cosine.

Alternatively, perhaps use some other identities or angle addition.

Wait, let me think about the values:

cos15° is approximately 0.9659, sin35° is approximately 0.5736, so 2 * 0.9659 / 0.5736 ≈ 2 * 1.683 ≈ 3.366. So tan θ ≈ -3.366. So θ is in the second or fourth quadrant, but since we need the smallest positive angle, it's in the second quadrant.

But maybe I can find an exact value.

Wait, let me see if I can relate 75° and 35°. 75° - 35° = 40°, not sure. Alternatively, 75° = 35° + 40°, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for sin(A) / sin(B). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, let me think about the numerator and denominator again.

Wait, tan θ = -2 cos15° / cos55°. Let me write this as tan θ = -2 cos15° / cos55°.

Alternatively, maybe express cos15° in terms of cos55°, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps use the identity for tan θ = [something], but I don't see a direct identity.

Wait, maybe I can write this as tan θ = -2 cos15° / cos55°, and then express this as a ratio of sines or something.

Alternatively, maybe use the sine of some angle.

Wait, let me think about the angle addition formula.

Alternatively, perhaps write cos15° as sin75°, so tan θ = -2 sin75° / sin35°, as I did before.

Wait, 75° is 35° + 40°, so maybe use sine addition formula:

sin75° = sin(35° + 40°) = sin35° cos40° + cos35° sin40°

So sin75° = sin35° cos40° + cos35° sin40°

So tan θ = -2 [sin35° cos40° + cos35° sin40°] / sin35°

= -2 [cos40° + (cos35° sin40°)/sin35°]

Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe factor out sin35°:

tan θ = -2 [sin75° / sin35°] = -2 [sin(35° + 40°) / sin35°]

= -2 [sin35° cos40° + cos35° sin40°] / sin35°

= -2 [cos40° + (cos35° sin40°)/sin35°]

Hmm, still not helpful.

Wait, maybe use the identity for sin(A)/sin(B). There's an identity for sin(A)/sin(B) in terms of cot or something, but I don't recall exactly.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for tan θ = [something], but I don't see it.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

tan θ = -2 cos15° / cos55°

But cos55° = sin35°, so tan θ = -2 cos15° / sin35°

Alternatively, write this as:

tan θ = -2 [cos15° / sin35°]

Hmm, maybe express cos15° as sin75°, so tan θ = -2 sin75° / sin35°

Wait, 75° is 35° + 40°, so maybe use sine addition:

sin75° = sin(35° + 40°) = sin35° cos40° + cos35° sin40°

So tan θ = -2 [sin35° cos40° + cos35° sin40°] / sin35°

= -2 [cos40° + (cos35° sin40°)/sin35°]

Hmm, not helpful.

Wait, maybe use the identity for sin(A)/sin(B):

sin A / sin B = [something], but I don't remember.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for tan θ = [something], but I don't see it.

Wait, maybe I can write this as:

tan θ = -2 [cos15° / cos55°]

But 15° and 55°, 15° + 55° = 70°, not sure.

Alternatively, maybe use the identity for cos A / cos B.

Wait, I think I'm stuck here. Maybe I can compute the numerical value and then find θ.

So tan θ ≈ -2 * cos15° / cos55°

Compute cos15° ≈ 0.9659258263

cos55° ≈ 0.5735764364

So 2 * 0.9659258263 ≈ 1.9318516526

Divide by 0.5735764364: 1.9318516526 / 0.5735764364 ≈ 3.366

So tan θ ≈ -3.366

So θ is arctangent of -3.366. Since tangent is negative, θ is in the second or fourth quadrant. But since we need the smallest positive angle, it's in the second quadrant.

So θ = 180° - arctan(3.366)

Compute arctan(3.366). Let me see, tan60° ≈ 1.732, tan70° ≈ 2.747, tan75° ≈ 3.732. So 3.366 is between tan70° and tan75°, closer to tan73°, maybe?

Let me compute tan73°: tan73 ≈ 3.270, tan74 ≈ 3.487. So 3.366 is between 73° and 74°, closer to 73.5°.

So arctan(3.366) ≈ 73.5°, so θ ≈ 180° - 73.5° = 106.5°

But the problem asks for the smallest positive angle, so 1","[1, '1']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, interesting. I remember that to find maxima or minima of functions with multiple variables, I can use calculus, specifically finding partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I should see if there's a simpler way or some symmetry in the function.

Looking at the function, it's symmetric in a way. If I swap \( x \) and \( y \), the function remains the same. So maybe the maximum occurs when \( x = y \)? Let me test that idea. If \( x = y \), then the function becomes \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). So now I have a single-variable function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Maybe I can find its maximum.

To find the maximum of \( g(x) \), I can take its derivative. Let's compute \( g'(x) \). Using the product rule:

\( g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

The derivative of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is \( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \). So plugging that in:

\( g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \left( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) \).

Simplify that:

\( g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \).

Combine the terms over a common denominator:

\( g'(x) = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \).

Set this equal to zero to find critical points:

\( \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \).

The denominator is always positive for \( |x| < 1 \), so we can ignore it for setting the numerator to zero:

\( 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \) => \( 4x^2 = 2 \) => \( x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \) => \( x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Since we're looking for a maximum, and \( x \) is between -1 and 1, let's test \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Plugging back into \( g(x) \):

\( g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} \).

Simplify inside the square root:

\( 1 - \frac{2}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \).

So,

\( g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \).

So when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1. Hmm, is this the maximum? Maybe, but I should check other possibilities because I assumed \( x = y \) earlier. Maybe the maximum occurs when \( x \) and \( y \) are not equal.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers since we have constraints \( -1 \leq x \leq 1 \) and \( -1 \leq y \leq 1 \). But since the function is defined on a closed and bounded domain, the maximum must be attained somewhere, either in the interior or on the boundary.

First, let's check the interior critical points by setting the partial derivatives equal to zero.

Compute the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \):

\( f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) \).

The derivative of the first term with respect to \( x \) is \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \).

The derivative of the second term is \( y \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \).

So,

\( f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \).

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\( f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) \).

Derivative of the first term is \( x \cdot \frac{-y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \).

Derivative of the second term is \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

So,

\( f_y = - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

To find critical points, set \( f_x = 0 \) and \( f_y = 0 \):

1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)
2. \( - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \)

Let me write these equations as:

1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Hmm, interesting. Let me denote equation 1 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \) --> equation (1)

And equation 2 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \) --> equation (2)

If I multiply equation (1) and equation (2) together:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \cdot \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Simplify the right-hand side:

\( \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}} \)

So,

\( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} = \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}} \)

Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} \):

\( (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

Expand the left-hand side:

\( 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \)

Subtract \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:

\( 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \)

So,

\( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \)

Okay, so the critical points lie on the unit circle. That's a helpful constraint.

Now, let's go back to equation (1):

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)

Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\( 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \)

Multiply both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \):

\( (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

But we already know from earlier that \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), so \( 1 - x^2 = y^2 \) and \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \). Let me substitute these into the equation:

Left-hand side: \( (x^2)(y^2) \)
Right-hand side: \( x^2 y^2 \)

So, both sides are equal. That doesn't give us new information. Hmm, so maybe we need another approach.

Since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) using trigonometric functions. Let me set \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \), where \( \theta \) is in the first quadrant because \( x \) and \( y \) are positive (since we're looking for maximum, likely in the first quadrant). Let's see.

So, substituting into \( f(x, y) \):

\( f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \)

Simplify the square roots:

\( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \)
\( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \)

So,

\( f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cdot \cos \theta + \sin \theta \cdot \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \)

Wait, so on the unit circle, the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1. But earlier, when I assumed \( x = y \), I also got 1. So, does that mean that the maximum is 1? But wait, is 1 the maximum?

Wait, let me test some other points. For example, if \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \), then \( f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = 1 \). Similarly, \( f(0, 1) = 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \). So, the function is 1 at those points as well.

But what if I take \( x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{1}{2} \). Then,

\( f\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2} \)

Compute each term:

First term: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \)

Second term: \( \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{3}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \)

So total: \( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 \). Hmm, still 1.

Wait, so is the function always equal to 1 on the unit circle? That seems to be the case. So, if \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), then \( f(x, y) = 1 \). So, does that mean that the maximum value is 1?

But wait, let me check another point not on the unit circle. For example, take \( x = y = \frac{1}{2} \). Then,

\( f\left( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), which is less than 1.

So, it seems that on the unit circle, the function is 1, and inside the circle, it's less than 1. So, the maximum is 1.

But wait, let me check another point. What if \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \)? Then,

\( f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \). So, that's less than 1.

What about \( x = 1 \) and \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)?

\( f(1, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot 0 = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 0.707 \), still less than 1.

So, it seems that the maximum value is indeed 1, achieved when either \( x \) or \( y \) is 1 and the other is 0, or","[0, '0']",1,"[1, '1']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, I remember that to find the area of a triangle in 3D space, one way is to use the cross product of two sides. Let me think about how that works.

First, I know that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found by half the magnitude of their cross product. So, if I can find vectors OA and OB, then compute their cross product, and then take half its magnitude, that should give me the area of triangle OAB. That makes sense because the cross product gives a vector perpendicular to both OA and OB, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB. So half of that would be the area of the triangle.

Alright, so let me write down the vectors:

Vector OA = (1, 2, 3)
Vector OB = (-3, -2, 1)

I need to compute the cross product of OA and OB. The cross product formula is:

OA × OB = |i   j   k|
             1   2   3
             -3  -2   1

So, expanding this determinant, it should be:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i component: 2*1 is 2, and 3*(-2) is -6. So, 2 - (-6) is 2 + 6, which is 8. So, the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component: The formula has a negative sign in front. Inside, it's 1*1 which is 1, and 3*(-3) is -9. So, 1 - (-9) is 1 + 9, which is 10. But since there's a negative sign, it becomes -10j.

Now, the k component: 1*(-2) is -2, and 2*(-3) is -6. So, -2 - (-6) is -2 + 6, which is 4. So, the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, hold on. The cross product formula is:

If vector OA = (a1, a2, a3) and vector OB = (b1, b2, b3), then OA × OB = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1). Let me apply this formula to make sure.

So, a1=1, a2=2, a3=3; b1=-3, b2=-2, b3=1.

First component (i): a2b3 - a3b2 = 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. That's correct.

Second component (j): a3b1 - a1b3 = 3*(-3) - 1*1 = -9 - 1 = -10. But wait, in the cross product formula, the j component is actually subtracted, so it's -(a1b3 - a3b1). Wait, maybe I confused the order.

Wait, let me recall the cross product formula properly. The cross product OA × OB is:

(i, j, k) × (a1, a2, a3) × (b1, b2, b3) = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1). So, the j component is a3b1 - a1b3, which is 3*(-3) - 1*1 = -9 -1 = -10. So, in the cross product vector, the j component is -10, but in the determinant expansion, it's subtracted, so it becomes -(-10) = +10? Wait, no, hold on.

Wait, no, in the determinant expansion, the j component is subtracted. So, the determinant is:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))

So, that's 8i - (1 - (-9))j + (-2 - (-6))k

Which is 8i - (10)j + (4)k

So, the cross product is (8, -10, 4). So, that's correct.

Wait, but in the formula, the cross product is (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1). So, plugging in:

First component: 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8

Second component: 3*(-3) - 1*1 = -9 -1 = -10

Third component: 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 +6 = 4

So, yes, the cross product is (8, -10, 4). So, that's correct.

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2).

Calculating each term:

8^2 = 64

(-10)^2 = 100

4^2 = 16

Adding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180

So, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Let me simplify sqrt(180). 180 is 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5).

Therefore, the magnitude of OA × OB is 6√5.

Since the area of the triangle is half of this, the area is (1/2)*6√5 = 3√5.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, cross product components:

i: 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 +6=8

j: 3*(-3) -1*1= -9 -1= -10

k:1*(-2) -2*(-3)= -2 +6=4

So, cross product is (8, -10, 4). Correct.

Magnitude squared: 8^2 + (-10)^2 +4^2=64+100+16=180. Correct.

sqrt(180)=sqrt(36*5)=6√5. Correct.

Half of that is 3√5. So, the area is 3√5.

Wait, but just to make sure, is there another way to compute the area? Maybe using Heron's formula? But for that, I would need the lengths of all three sides, which might be more complicated. Alternatively, I could compute the area using the formula (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between OA and OB. But since I already have the cross product, which gives |OA||OB|sin(theta), so half of that is the area. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, I can compute the lengths of OA and OB, then compute the angle between them using the dot product, and then compute the area as (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta). Let me try that as a check.

First, compute |OA|: sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 +3^2)=sqrt(1+4+9)=sqrt(14)

Compute |OB|: sqrt((-3)^2 + (-2)^2 +1^2)=sqrt(9+4+1)=sqrt(14)

Interesting, both vectors have the same magnitude, sqrt(14).

Now, compute the dot product OA · OB: (1)(-3) + (2)(-2) + (3)(1) = -3 -4 +3 = -4

So, OA · OB = -4

We know that OA · OB = |OA||OB|cos(theta), so cos(theta)= (OA · OB)/(|OA||OB|)= (-4)/(sqrt(14)*sqrt(14))= (-4)/14= -2/7

Therefore, sin(theta)=sqrt(1 - cos^2(theta))=sqrt(1 - (4/49))=sqrt(45/49)= (3√5)/7

Therefore, the area is (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta)= (1/2)*(sqrt(14))*(sqrt(14))*(3√5)/7

Simplify:

sqrt(14)*sqrt(14)=14

So, (1/2)*14*(3√5)/7= (7)*(3√5)/7= 3√5

So, same result. So, that confirms that the area is indeed 3√5.

Therefore, I can be confident that the area of triangle OAB is 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) with given vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding the determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Calculating each component:

- The \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- The \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \)
- The \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where z is a complex number, and it's given that z + 1/z equals (1 + sqrt(5))/2. I need to find z^85 + 1/z^85. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that expressions like z + 1/z often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since z is a complex number, maybe I can express it in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number can be written as z = e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. If I do that, then 1/z would be e^{-iθ}, right? So, z + 1/z would be e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}, which is equal to 2cosθ. 

Wait, so in this case, z + 1/z is given as (1 + sqrt(5))/2. That means 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let me compute that value. (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is approximately (1 + 2.236)/2, which is about 1.618. But wait, 2cosθ can't be more than 2, and 1.618 is less than 2, so that's okay. So, cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me calculate that: (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 0.809. So, cosθ ≈ 0.809. 

Hmm, 0.809 is a familiar value. I think it's related to the golden ratio. Let me recall that cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, wait, no. Wait, actually, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2? Let me check. Wait, cos(36°) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 * 1/2? Wait, maybe I'm confusing something.

Wait, let me compute cos(36°). I know that cos(36°) is equal to (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * 1/2? Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think differently. I remember that cos(36°) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 * 1/2? Hmm, maybe I should just compute it numerically. 36 degrees in radians is π/5, which is approximately 0.628 radians. The cosine of that is approximately 0.8090, which matches the value we have. So, cosθ = cos(36°), which means θ is 36°, or π/5 radians. 

But wait, cosine is positive in the first and fourth quadrants, so θ could be π/5 or -π/5, or 2π - π/5, etc. But since z is a complex number, it can be represented in multiple ways, but for simplicity, let's take θ = π/5. So, z = e^{iπ/5}, and 1/z = e^{-iπ/5}. 

Now, the problem asks for z^85 + 1/z^85. Let me compute that. If z = e^{iπ/5}, then z^85 = e^{i85π/5} = e^{i17π}. Similarly, 1/z^85 = e^{-i17π}. So, z^85 + 1/z^85 = e^{i17π} + e^{-i17π} = 2cos(17π). 

Wait, cos(17π) is the same as cos(π) because cosine has a period of 2π. So, 17π is equal to 8*2π + π, so cos(17π) = cos(π) = -1. Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = 2*(-1) = -2. 

But wait, let me double-check that. 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 85π/5 is 17π. Yes, that's correct. So, 17π is an odd multiple of π, so cosine of that is -1. So, 2cos(17π) is -2. 

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem without using Euler's formula? Maybe using recurrence relations or something? Because sometimes when dealing with powers of complex numbers, especially roots of unity, you can use recurrence relations for expressions like z^n + 1/z^n.

Let me recall that if we have z + 1/z = k, then z^n + 1/z^n can be found using a recurrence relation. Specifically, if we let a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, then a_{n+1} = (z + 1/z) * a_n - a_{n-1}. So, in this case, a_1 = z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, and a_0 = z^0 + 1/z^0 = 2. 

So, we can compute a_2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_1 - a_0. Let me compute that. a_1 is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so a_2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 - 2. Let me compute [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2: that's (1 + 2sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2. So, a_2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 4)/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

Similarly, a_3 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_2 - a_1. Let's compute that. a_2 is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2, so:

a_3 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] - [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]

First, compute the product:

[(1 + sqrt(5))( -1 + sqrt(5))]/4 = [(-1 + sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) + 5)]/4 = [(-1 + 5)]/4 = 4/4 = 1.

So, a_3 = 1 - [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] = (2 - 1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Hmm, interesting. Let's compute a_4:

a_4 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_3 - a_2

a_3 is (1 - sqrt(5))/2, a_2 is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

So,

a_4 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(1 - sqrt(5))/2] - [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2]

Compute the product:

[(1 + sqrt(5))(1 - sqrt(5))]/4 = (1 - 5)/4 = (-4)/4 = -1.

So, a_4 = -1 - [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] = -1 + (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-2 + 1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Now, a_5 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_4 - a_3

a_4 is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2, a_3 is (1 - sqrt(5))/2.

So,

a_5 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] - [(1 - sqrt(5))/2]

Compute the product:

[(1 + sqrt(5))( -1 - sqrt(5))]/4 = [(-1 - sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) - 5)]/4 = [(-6 - 2sqrt(5))]/4 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2.

So, a_5 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2 - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = [(-3 - sqrt(5)) -1 + sqrt(5)]/2 = (-4)/2 = -2.

Wait, a_5 is -2. Interesting. Let's see a_6:

a_6 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_5 - a_4

a_5 is -2, a_4 is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2.

So,

a_6 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * (-2) - [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] = [(-2 - 2sqrt(5))/2] + (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = [(-2 - 2sqrt(5)) +1 + sqrt(5)]/2 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Wait, that's the same as a_4. Hmm, so a_6 = a_4. Let's compute a_7:

a_7 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_6 - a_5

a_6 is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2, a_5 is -2.

So,

a_7 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] - (-2) = [(-1 - sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) -5)/4] + 2 = [(-6 - 2sqrt(5))/4] + 2 = [(-3 - sqrt(5))/2] + 2 = (-3 - sqrt(5) + 4)/2 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Which is a_3. So, a_7 = a_3.

Similarly, a_8 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_7 - a_6

a_7 is (1 - sqrt(5))/2, a_6 is (-1 - sqrt(5))/2.

So,

a_8 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(1 - sqrt(5))/2] - [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] = [(-4)/4] + (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-1) + (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-2 +1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2, which is a_2.

So, a_8 = a_2.

Continuing, a_9 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_8 - a_7

a_8 is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2, a_7 is (1 - sqrt(5))/2.

So,

a_9 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] - [(1 - sqrt(5))/2] = [(-1 + sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) +5)/4] - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = [4/4] - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = 1 - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (2 -1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which is a_1.

So, a_9 = a_1.

And a_10 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2 * a_9 - a_8

a_9 is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, a_8 is (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

So,

a_10 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 - [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - (-1 + sqrt(5))/2 = [3 + sqrt(5) +1 - sqrt(5)]/2 = 4/2 = 2, which is a_0.

So, a_10 = a_0.

So, looking at the sequence:

a_0 = 2

a_1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_3 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_4 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_5 = -2

a_6 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_7 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_8 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_9 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_10 = 2

So, the sequence repeats every 10 terms. So, the period is 10. That is, a_{n+10} = a_n.

Therefore, to find a_{85}, we can compute 85 mod 10, which is 5. So, a_{85} = a_5 = -2.

Wait, that's the same result as before. So, whether I use Euler's formula or the recurrence relation, I get the same answer, which is -2. So, that seems consistent.

But just to make sure, let me think again. If z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which is approximately 1.618, which is the golden ratio. So, z is a complex number on the unit circle, since |z| = 1 because z + 1/z is real. So, z lies on the unit circle, so |z| = 1, which means z = e^{iθ} as I thought earlier.

So, z^85 is e^{i85θ}, and 1/z^85 is e^{-i85θ}, so their sum is 2cos(85θ). Since θ = π/5, 85θ = 85*(π/5) = 17π. So, cos(17π) = cos(π) = -1, so 2cos(17π) = -2. Yep, that's consistent.

Alternatively, using the recurrence relation, since the sequence repeats every 10 terms, 85 divided by 10 is 8 with a remainder of 5, so a_{85} = a_5 = -2.

Therefore, the answer is -2.

**Final Answer**

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and its medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. A line passing through G is parallel to BC and intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. Since it's parallel to BC, triangle AMN should be similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem. That theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, if MN is parallel to BC, then AM/AB = AN/AC. Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k. Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through the centroid G, I need to find the ratio k.

Wait, how does the centroid affect this ratio? The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio, so maybe the distance from A to MN is 2/3 of the height from A to BC? Because the centroid is located 2/3 of the way along each median from the vertex.

Let me think about the heights. If the height of triangle ABC from A to BC is h, then the height from A to MN would be (2/3)h. Since the ratio of the heights in similar triangles is equal to the ratio of their corresponding sides, the ratio k should be 2/3. Therefore, the area of triangle AMN would be (2/3)^2 times the area of ABC, which is (4/9)*144 = 64. So, area of AMN is 64.

But wait, the problem is asking for the area of triangle ENG, not AMN. Hmm, so I need to figure out where points E and N are located.

Point E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. So, E is the midpoint, meaning AE = EC. Point N is the intersection of the line through G parallel to BC with AC. So, N is somewhere on AC.

I need to find the coordinates or the ratios to determine the area of triangle ENG. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC to make it easier.

Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). This way, the coordinates are general, and I can compute everything algebraically.

First, let's find the centroid G. The centroid is the average of the coordinates of the vertices. So, G_x = (0 + 2b + 2c)/3 = (2b + 2c)/3, and G_y = (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 = (2d)/3. So, G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

Now, the line MN is parallel to BC and passes through G. Let's find the equation of BC first. Points B and C are at (2b, 0) and (2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b). So, the slope of MN is also d/(c - b) because it's parallel.

The equation of line MN passing through G is: y - (2d/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3). Let's simplify this equation.

Multiply both sides by (c - b):

(c - b)(y - 2d/3) = d(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Expanding both sides:

(c - b)y - (c - b)(2d/3) = d x - d(2b + 2c)/3

Bring all terms to one side:

(c - b)y - d x - (c - b)(2d/3) + d(2b + 2c)/3 = 0

Simplify the constants:

- (c - b)(2d/3) + d(2b + 2c)/3 = (-2d(c - b) + 2d(b + c))/3

= (-2dc + 2db + 2db + 2dc)/3

= (4db)/3

So, the equation becomes:

(c - b)y - d x + (4db)/3 = 0

Wait, maybe I made a miscalculation there. Let me check:

Wait, expanding (c - b)(2d/3) is (2d/3)(c - b). Similarly, d(2b + 2c)/3 is (2d/3)(b + c). So, when subtracting:

- (2d/3)(c - b) + (2d/3)(b + c) = (2d/3)[ - (c - b) + (b + c) ] = (2d/3)[ -c + b + b + c ] = (2d/3)(2b) = (4db)/3. Okay, that seems correct.

So, the equation is (c - b)y - d x + (4db)/3 = 0.

Now, let's find points M and N where this line intersects AB and AC.

First, point M is on AB. AB is from (0,0) to (2b, 0). So, AB lies along the x-axis, y = 0.

Substitute y = 0 into the equation of MN:

(c - b)(0) - d x + (4db)/3 = 0 => -d x + (4db)/3 = 0 => x = (4db)/3d = (4b)/3.

So, point M is at (4b/3, 0).

Similarly, point N is on AC. AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d). Let's parametrize AC. A point on AC can be written as (2c t, 2d t) where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Substitute x = 2c t and y = 2d t into the equation of MN:

(c - b)(2d t) - d(2c t) + (4db)/3 = 0

Simplify:

2d(c - b) t - 2c d t + (4db)/3 = 0

Factor out 2d t:

2d t [ (c - b) - c ] + (4db)/3 = 0

Simplify inside the brackets:

(c - b - c) = -b

So, 2d t (-b) + (4db)/3 = 0

=> -2b d t + (4b d)/3 = 0

Divide both sides by b d (assuming b ≠ 0, d ≠ 0):

-2 t + 4/3 = 0 => -2t = -4/3 => t = 2/3

So, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3).

Okay, so now we have coordinates for M and N: M is (4b/3, 0) and N is (4c/3, 4d/3).

Now, let's recall that E is the midpoint of AC. Since AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), the midpoint E is at ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d).

So, E is at (c, d).

Now, we need to find the area of triangle ENG. Points E, N, and G.

We have coordinates for E, N, and G:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Let me write them down:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3)

To find the area of triangle ENG, I can use the shoelace formula.

First, let's list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, 2d/3)

Let me denote them as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3):

x1 = c, y1 = d

x2 = 4c/3, y2 = 4d/3

x3 = (2b + 2c)/3, y3 = 2d/3

The shoelace formula is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plugging in the values:

Area = |(c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3))/2|

Simplify each term step by step.

First term: c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2c d)/3

Second term: (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = (-4c d)/9

Third term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = (- (2b + 2c) d)/9

So, putting it all together:

Area = |( (2c d)/3 + (-4c d)/9 + (- (2b + 2c) d)/9 ) / 2 |

Let me combine the terms:

First, convert (2c d)/3 to ninths: (6c d)/9

So, 6c d /9 - 4c d /9 - (2b + 2c) d /9

Combine the numerators:

[6c d - 4c d - 2b d - 2c d] /9

Simplify numerator:

6c d - 4c d - 2c d = 0c d

So, numerator becomes -2b d

Thus, Area = | ( -2b d /9 ) / 2 | = | (-2b d /9 ) * (1/2) | = | -b d /9 | = (b d)/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is (b d)/9.

But wait, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC? Using coordinates, the area can be calculated as well.

Points A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d). Using shoelace formula:

Area = |(0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0))/2| = |0 + 4b d + 0| /2 = |4b d| /2 = 2b d

So, area of ABC is 2b d = 144 => b d = 72

Therefore, the area of triangle ENG is (b d)/9 = 72 /9 = 8

So, the area is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with coordinates, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, area of ABC: 2b d = 144 => b d = 72. Correct.

Area of ENG: (b d)/9 = 72/9 = 8. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ratio approach without coordinates.

Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through centroid G, which divides the median in 2:1. So, the ratio of similarity is 2/3, as I thought earlier, making the area of AMN 64.

But then, how does triangle ENG relate to this?

Point E is the midpoint of AC, so E divides AC into two equal parts. Point N is on AC, and since MN is parallel to BC, and G is the centroid, maybe we can find the ratio of AN to AC.

Wait, from earlier, in the coordinate approach, point N was at (4c/3, 4d/3). Since AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), the point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3), which is beyond the midpoint E at (c, d). Wait, that can't be because if MN is parallel to BC and passes through G, which is inside the triangle, N should be between A and C, not beyond.

Wait, hold on, in my coordinate system, point N was at (4c/3, 4d/3). But AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d). So, 4c/3 is less than 2c, so it's still on AC. Because 4c/3 is approximately 1.333c, which is less than 2c. So, it's between A and C, closer to C.

Similarly, point M is at (4b/3, 0), which is beyond the midpoint of AB, which is at (b, 0). So, M is closer to B.

So, in triangle AMN, points M and N are closer to B and C respectively.

But in any case, the area of AMN is 64, as calculated earlier.

But we need the area of ENG. So, maybe instead of coordinates, I can use area ratios.

Since E is the midpoint of AC, and N is a point on AC such that AN = (4/3)c, but wait, in coordinates, N was at (4c/3, 4d/3). So, the ratio AN/AC is (4c/3)/(2c) = 2/3. So, AN is 2/3 of AC.

Wait, that's interesting. So, AN = (2/3) AC, meaning that N divides AC in the ratio 2:1, with AN:NC = 2:1.

Similarly, point M","[2, '2']",8,"[8, '8']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem here: For how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) does \( 2^{24} \) represent a perfect \( n \)-th power? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I need to understand what it means for a number to be a perfect \( n \)-th power. A number \( x \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power if there exists some integer \( k \) such that \( x = k^n \). In this case, \( x \) is \( 2^{24} \). So, I need to find all integers \( n > 1 \) for which there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( 2^{24} = k^n \).

Let me write that equation down: \( 2^{24} = k^n \). I need to find all \( n > 1 \) such that this equation holds. Since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let me denote \( k \) as \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is a positive integer. Substituting this into the equation, I get:

\( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \)

Simplifying the right side, \( (2^m)^n = 2^{m \cdot n} \). So, the equation becomes:

\( 2^{24} = 2^{m \cdot n} \)

Since the bases are the same and the exponents must be equal for the equation to hold, we have:

\( 24 = m \cdot n \)

So, now the problem reduces to finding all positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( n \) divides 24. In other words, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24, and \( n > 1 \).

Alright, so I need to find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. Let me list the divisors of 24. To do this, I can factorize 24 into its prime factors:

\( 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \)

The number of divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying those results. So, for 24, the exponents are 3 and 1. Adding 1 to each gives 4 and 2. Multiplying these together: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \). So, 24 has 8 divisors in total.

Let me list all the divisors:

1. \( 1 \) (but since \( n > 1 \), we exclude this)
2. \( 2 \)
3. \( 3 \)
4. \( 4 \)
5. \( 6 \)
6. \( 8 \)
7. \( 12 \)
8. \( 24 \)

So, excluding 1, the divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. That's 7 divisors.

Wait, let me double-check that. The divisors of 24 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. So, excluding 1, we have 7 numbers. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me think again. Each of these \( n \) values should satisfy \( 24 = m \cdot n \), meaning \( m = 24 / n \) must be an integer. So, for each \( n \) in the list, \( m \) should be an integer.

Let's test a couple:

- For \( n = 2 \): \( m = 24 / 2 = 12 \), which is an integer. So, \( k = 2^{12} \), and \( (2^{12})^2 = 2^{24} \). That works.
- For \( n = 3 \): \( m = 24 / 3 = 8 \), which is an integer. So, \( k = 2^8 \), and \( (2^8)^3 = 2^{24} \). That works too.
- For \( n = 4 \): \( m = 24 / 4 = 6 \), integer. \( k = 2^6 \), \( (2^6)^4 = 2^{24} \). Correct.
- For \( n = 6 \): \( m = 24 / 6 = 4 \), integer. \( k = 2^4 \), \( (2^4)^6 = 2^{24} \). Yep.
- For \( n = 8 \): \( m = 24 / 8 = 3 \), integer. \( k = 2^3 \), \( (2^3)^8 = 2^{24} \). That's right.
- For \( n = 12 \): \( m = 24 / 12 = 2 \), integer. \( k = 2^2 \), \( (2^2)^{12} = 2^{24} \). Correct.
- For \( n = 24 \): \( m = 24 / 24 = 1 \), integer. \( k = 2^1 = 2 \), \( 2^{24} = 2^{24} \). That works as well.

So, all these \( n \) values satisfy the condition. Therefore, there are 7 such positive integers \( n > 1 \).

I think that's thorough enough. I considered the definition, broke it down, found the divisors, checked each one, and confirmed they all work. So, the answer should be 7.

**Final Answer**
The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by noting that \( 2^{24} = k^n \) for some integer \( k \). Expressing \( k \) as \( 2^m \), we get:

\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \]
\[ 2^{24} = 2^{m \cdot n} \]

This implies:

\[ 24 = m \cdot n \]

We need to find all divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. The prime factorization of 24 is:

\[ 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \]

The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Excluding 1, the valid divisors are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Each of these divisors \( n \) ensures that \( m = \frac{24}{n} \) is an integer, confirming that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

Thus, there are 7 such positive integers \( n > 1 \).

"Okay, so I have this problem here with twelve 1x1 squares forming a rectangle, and I need to find the area of the shaded region. Hmm, let me try to visualize it based on the Asymptote code provided. 

First, the Asymptote code sets up a grid. It mentions that the size is 4cm, but I think that's just the drawing size, not the actual dimensions. The grid has vertical lines from x=0 to x=3 and horizontal lines from y=0 to y=4. So, the rectangle is 3 units wide and 4 units tall, right? Because there are 4 vertical lines (0 to 3) and 5 horizontal lines (0 to 4). So, the entire rectangle is 3x4, which makes sense because 3 times 4 is 12 squares, each of size 1x1. Got that.

Now, the shaded areas are two triangles. The first one is from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). The second one is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So, let me plot these points mentally. 

Starting with the first triangle: (0,4) is the top-left corner, (0,0) is the bottom-left corner, and (2,0) is two units to the right on the bottom. So, this triangle is a right triangle with base along the bottom from (0,0) to (2,0), which is 2 units long, and height from (0,0) to (0,4), which is 4 units. Wait, but actually, the triangle is formed by connecting (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). So, it's a right triangle with legs of 2 and 4. The area of a right triangle is (base * height)/2, so that would be (2*4)/2 = 4. So, the first shaded area is 4 square units.

Now, the second shaded area is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). Let me see. (0,4) is the top-left, (3,4) is the top-right, and (3,0) is the bottom-right. So, this is another right triangle, but this time the base is along the top from (0,4) to (3,4), which is 3 units, and the height is from (3,4) to (3,0), which is 4 units. So, the area would be (3*4)/2 = 6. So, the second shaded area is 6 square units.

Wait, but hold on. The problem says ""celková plocha vyznačenej oblasti,"" which translates to ""the total area of the shaded region."" So, I need to add these two areas together. 4 + 6 equals 10. So, the total shaded area is 10 square units.

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. The first triangle is from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). So, yes, that's a right triangle with legs 2 and 4, area 4. The second triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). That's a right triangle with legs 3 and 4, area 6. Adding them together gives 10. 

Wait, but looking back at the Asymptote code, it draws two diagonals: one from (0,4) to (3,0) and another from (0,4) to (2,0). So, the shaded areas are the two triangles formed by these diagonals. So, the first triangle is the one from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0), which is the left part, and the second triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0), which is the right part. So, yes, both are right triangles with areas 4 and 6, totaling 10.

But just to be thorough, let me visualize the entire grid. It's a 3x4 grid, so 3 columns and 4 rows. The first shaded triangle is in the bottom-left corner, spanning from the bottom-left corner (0,0) up to (0,4) and over to (2,0). So, that covers the first two columns on the bottom and the entire left edge. The second shaded triangle is the entire top row from (0,4) to (3,4) and down to (3,0). So, that covers the entire rightmost column and the top row.

Wait, but when I add these two areas, am I double-counting any part? Let me see. The first triangle is in the bottom-left, and the second is in the top-right. They only meet at the point (0,4) and (3,0), but they don't overlap anywhere else. So, their areas are distinct and can be safely added together. So, 4 + 6 is indeed 10.

Alternatively, maybe I can calculate the area using coordinates. The first triangle has vertices at (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). Using the formula for the area of a triangle with coordinates, which is |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|. Plugging in the points:

x1=0, y1=4; x2=0, y2=0; x3=2, y3=0.

So, area = |0*(0 - 0) + 0*(0 - 4) + 2*(4 - 0)| / 2 = |0 + 0 + 8| / 2 = 8/2 = 4. That matches.

For the second triangle, vertices at (0,4), (3,4), (3,0).

Using the same formula:

x1=0, y1=4; x2=3, y2=4; x3=3, y3=0.

Area = |0*(4 - 0) + 3*(0 - 4) + 3*(4 - 4)| / 2 = |0 + (-12) + 0| / 2 = 12/2 = 6. That also matches.

So, adding them together, 4 + 6 = 10. So, the total shaded area is 10.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think about the entire grid. The grid is 3x4, so total area is 12. If the shaded area is 10, then the unshaded area is 2. Let me see if that makes sense.

Looking at the Asymptote code, the shaded areas are two triangles. The first triangle covers the leftmost two columns on the bottom, and the second covers the top row and the rightmost column. So, the unshaded area would be the remaining parts. Let me count the squares.

In the bottom row, from x=0 to x=2, y=0, that's 2 squares shaded. Then, in the top row, from x=0 to x=3, y=4, that's 3 squares shaded. But wait, actually, the triangles are not just the squares; they are the areas within the triangles. So, maybe it's better to think in terms of the triangles' areas rather than individual squares.

But since each square is 1x1, the area calculations should be straightforward. So, the total shaded area is 10, which is less than the total grid area of 12, so the unshaded area is 2. That seems plausible.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the diagonals drawn. The first diagonal is from (0,4) to (3,0), which is the main diagonal of the entire rectangle. The second diagonal is from (0,4) to (2,0), which is a diagonal in the left part of the rectangle.

So, the shaded areas are the two triangles formed by these diagonals. The first triangle is the area below the diagonal from (0,4) to (2,0), and the second is the area above the diagonal from (0,4) to (3,0). Wait, no, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, both shaded areas are filled, so they are both below their respective diagonals.

Wait, no, the first fill is from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0), which is a triangle on the left side, and the second fill is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0), which is a triangle on the right side. So, they are both right triangles, one with base 2 and height 4, the other with base 3 and height 4.

So, their areas are 4 and 6, totaling 10. So, I think that's correct.

Wait, but just to make sure, maybe I can calculate the area using coordinate geometry for both triangles.

For the first triangle: points (0,4), (0,0), (2,0). The base is from (0,0) to (2,0), which is 2 units. The height is from (0,0) to (0,4), which is 4 units. So, area is (2*4)/2 = 4.

For the second triangle: points (0,4), (3,4), (3,0). The base is from (0,4) to (3,4), which is 3 units. The height is from (3,4) to (3,0), which is 4 units. So, area is (3*4)/2 = 6.

Adding them together, 4 + 6 = 10. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of the entire grid and subtract the unshaded areas. The unshaded area would be the area not covered by the two triangles. So, the total area is 12. If the shaded area is 10, then the unshaded area is 2. Let me see if that makes sense.

Looking at the grid, the unshaded area would be the area above the first triangle and to the left of the second triangle. Wait, no, actually, the first triangle is on the bottom-left, and the second is on the top-right. So, the unshaded area would be the area that's not covered by either triangle. Let me try to visualize it.

From the Asymptote code, the first triangle is from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). So, that covers the leftmost two columns on the bottom. The second triangle is from (0,4) to (3,4) to (3,0). So, that covers the top row and the rightmost column. So, the unshaded area would be the area in the middle that's not covered by either triangle.

Specifically, in the middle of the grid, there's a rectangle from x=2 to x=3 and y=0 to y=4, but part of it is shaded by the second triangle. Wait, no, the second triangle covers from (3,4) to (3,0), so the entire rightmost column is shaded. So, the unshaded area would be the area in the middle that's above the first triangle and below the second triangle.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the overlapping areas. But since the two triangles don't overlap, their areas can be added directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can count the squares in the shaded areas. Each square is 1x1, so each has an area of 1. Let's see.

For the first triangle, from (0,4) to (0,0) to (2,0). This triangle covers the leftmost two columns on the bottom. So, in the bottom row, from x=0 to x=2, y=0, that's 2 squares. Then, moving up, at y=1, the triangle would cover from x=0 to x=1, since the diagonal from (0,4) to (2,0) would intersect at x=1 when y=1. Similarly, at y=2, it would cover x=0 to x=0.5, and at y=3, x=0 to x=0.25. Wait, but since we're dealing with 1x1 squares, maybe it's better to approximate.

But actually, since the area is 4, which is 4 square units, and each square is 1, that would mean 4 squares are shaded in the first triangle. Similarly, the second triangle has an area of 6, so 6 squares are shaded there. So, total shaded squares would be 10, which is 10 square units.

Wait, but in reality, the triangles might cover parts of squares, but since the area is calculated as 4 and 6, which are whole numbers, it makes sense that the total shaded area is 10.

So, after all this thinking, I believe the total shaded area is 10 square units.
</think>

The total shaded area is the sum of the areas of two right triangles. The first triangle has a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units, giving an area of 4. The second triangle has a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units, giving an area of 6. Adding these together, the total shaded area is 10 square units.

"Ako počítať súčet číslic v desatinnom zobrazení zlomku \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\)?

Najprv si potrebujeme zlomok \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) previesť na desatinný zápis. Preto musíme zlomok upraviť tak, aby měl v jmenovateli mocninu 10, pretože desatinné číslo je založené na desiatkovej sústave.

Vidíme, že v jmenovateli je \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). Vieme, že \(10^n = 5^n \cdot 2^n\), takže aby sme mohli zlomok previesť na desatinný zápis, musíme rovnomerne rozšíriť čitateľ a jmenovateľ, aby jmenovateľ bol mocninou 10.

V tomto prípade, \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) môžeme prepočítať na \(10^7 \cdot 2^{1}\), pretože \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 = 10^7\) a zostáva ešte \(2^1\). Toto znamená, že jmenovateľ je \(10^7 \cdot 2 = 20 \cdot 10^7\).

Ďalej, aby sme zlomok previesli na desatinný zápis, musíme čitateľ 4321 vynásobiť rovnakým číslom, čo sme vynásobili jmenovateľ, t.j., 2. Toto získame \(4321 \cdot 2 = 8642\).

Teraz máme zlomok \(\frac{8642}{20 \cdot 10^7}\), ktorý môžeme zapisovať ako \(\frac{8642}{200000000}\).

Ďalej, prevádzime tento zlomok na desatinný zápis. Preto musíme 8642 deliť na 200000000. V tomto prípade, 8642 je menšie ako 200000000, takže desatinný zápis bude začínať nulou, následovanou desatinnou čiarkou a potom požadovanými číslicami.

Výpočet 8642 / 200000000:

- 200000000 je 2 x 10^8, takže 8642 / 200000000 = 0.00004321

Takže desatinný zápis zlomku je 0.00004321.

Ďalej, počítame súčet číslic v tomto desatinnom zobrazení:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of sines at various angles: sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, and sin160°. That's eight sine terms multiplied together. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help simplify this.

First, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities. But with eight terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that products of sines at equally spaced angles can sometimes be expressed in terms of multiple angles or using complex numbers. Let me think about that.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. These angles are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, which is 8 times 20°. So, they are spaced 20° apart. That makes me think of the roots of unity or something related to the unit circle.

Wait, another thought: I remember that the product of sines of equally spaced angles can be related to the sine of multiple angles. There's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/n) for k from 1 to n-1, which is n/(2^{n-1}). But in this case, the angles aren't in radians, they're in degrees, and they aren't from 1 to n-1, but rather specific multiples.

Let me convert the angles to radians to see if that helps. 20° is π/9, 40° is 2π/9, 60° is π/3, 80° is 4π/9, 100° is 5π/9, 120° is 2π/3, 140° is 7π/9, and 160° is 8π/9. So, in radians, the angles are π/9, 2π/9, π/3, 4π/9, 5π/9, 2π/3, 7π/9, 8π/9.

Hmm, so these are all multiples of π/9, except for π/3 and 2π/3, which are 3π/9 and 6π/9. So, actually, all angles are multiples of π/9, specifically kπ/9 where k is from 1 to 8, excluding 3 and 6? Wait, no, 3π/9 is π/3 and 6π/9 is 2π/3, which are included. So actually, it's kπ/9 for k = 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. So, all the angles from π/9 to 8π/9 in increments of π/9.

So, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) sin(4π/9) sin(5π/9) sin(6π/9) sin(7π/9) sin(8π/9). That's the product of sin(kπ/9) for k=1 to 8.

Wait, I remember that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). So, in this case, n would be 9, so the product would be 9/(2^8) = 9/256. But wait, in our case, we have k from 1 to 8, which is n-1 where n=9. So, is the product 9/(2^8) = 9/256?

But hold on, let me verify that formula. The formula is that the product from k=1 to n-1 of sin(kπ/n) = n/(2^{n-1}). So, for n=9, it should be 9/(2^8) = 9/256. So, is that the case here?

But wait, in our problem, the angles are in degrees, but when converted to radians, they are kπ/9 for k=1 to 8. So, the product is indeed the same as the product from k=1 to 8 of sin(kπ/9). So, according to the formula, that should be 9/(2^8) = 9/256.

But wait, let me make sure. Let me check for a smaller n. For example, n=3. The product sin(π/3) sin(2π/3) = (√3/2)(√3/2) = 3/4. According to the formula, it should be 3/(2^{2}) = 3/4. That works. Similarly, for n=4, the product sin(π/4) sin(2π/4) sin(3π/4) = (√2/2)(1)(√2/2) = (√2/2)^2 *1 = (2/4)*1 = 1/2. According to the formula, 4/(2^3) = 4/8 = 1/2. That also works. So, the formula seems correct.

Therefore, for n=9, the product should be 9/(2^8) = 9/256. So, is that the answer? Wait, but in our problem, the angles are in degrees, but when converted to radians, they are kπ/9, so the formula applies. So, the product is 9/256.

But wait, let me think again. The formula is for the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1. In our case, n=9, so k=1 to 8. So, yes, that's exactly our case. So, the product is 9/256.

But wait, let me compute it numerically to check. Let me compute the product step by step.

First, compute each sine:

sin20° ≈ sin(0.3491) ≈ 0.3420

sin40° ≈ sin(0.6981) ≈ 0.6428

sin60° ≈ sin(1.0472) ≈ 0.8660

sin80° ≈ sin(1.3963) ≈ 0.9848

sin100° ≈ sin(1.7453) ≈ 0.9848

sin120° ≈ sin(2.0944) ≈ 0.8660

sin140° ≈ sin(2.4435) ≈ 0.6428

sin160° ≈ sin(2.7925) ≈ 0.3420

Now, let's compute the product:

0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198

0.2198 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1903

0.1903 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1879

0.1879 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1855

0.1855 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1607

0.1607 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.1033

0.1033 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0353

So, the approximate product is about 0.0353. Now, 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625, which is very close to 0.0353. So, that seems to confirm that the exact value is 9/256.

Therefore, the product is 9/256.

But wait, let me think again. The formula gives the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 as n/(2^{n-1}). So, for n=9, it's 9/256. So, that's the exact value.

But just to make sure, let me think about another approach. Maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity.

I remember that the product of sines can be related to the roots of the equation sin(9θ) = 0, which has roots at θ = kπ/9 for k=0,1,...,8. So, sin(9θ) can be expressed as a product involving sinθ terms.

Wait, the identity for sin(nθ) can be written as a product of terms involving sinθ and cosines. But I'm not sure if that directly helps here.

Alternatively, I recall that the product of sines can be expressed using the formula:

Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n / 2^{n-1}

Which is exactly the formula I used earlier. So, for n=9, it's 9/256.

Therefore, I think the answer is 9/256.

But just to be thorough, let me see if there's another way to compute this product.

Another approach is to pair the terms. Notice that sin(160°) = sin(180° - 20°) = sin20°, similarly sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, sin100° = sin80°. So, the product can be written as [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.

So, let me compute the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° first, then square it.

So, let me compute sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.

I remember that sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4. Maybe that identity can help here.

Let me set A=20°, then sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = sin3*20° /4 = sin60° /4 = (√3/2)/4 = √3/8.

Wait, that's interesting. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = √3/8.

But in our case, we have sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°. So, that's [sin20° sin40° sin80°] * sin60° = (√3/8) * (√3/2) = (3/16).

So, sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = 3/16.

Therefore, the original product is [3/16]^2 = 9/256.

So, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the product is 9/256.

**Final Answer**
The value of the product is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}.

To find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by converting the angles to radians. The angles are \(\frac{\pi}{9}, \frac{2\pi}{9}, \frac{\pi}{3}, \frac{4\pi}{9}, \frac{5\pi}{9}, \frac{2\pi}{3}, \frac{7\pi}{9}, \frac{8\pi}{9}\).

We recognize that these angles are of the form \(\frac{k\pi}{9}\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 8\). The product of sines of these angles can be simplified using the formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{n}\right) = \frac{n}{2^{n-1}}
\]

For \(n = 9\), the product is:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{8} \sin\left(\frac{k\pi}{9}\right) = \frac{9}{2^8} = \frac{9}{256}
\]

To verify, we can pair the terms and use trigonometric identities. Noting that \(\sin(180^\circ - \theta) = \sin\theta\), we pair the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ)(\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ)(\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ)(\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ)
\]

Each pair simplifies to \(\sin^2 \theta\), leading to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Using the identity \(\sin A \sin (60^\circ - A) \sin (60^\circ + A) = \frac{\sin 3A}{4}\) for \(A = 20^\circ\), we find:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Multiplying by \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we get:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right) = \frac{3}{16}
\]

Squaring this result gives:

\[
\left(\frac{3}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Thus, the value of the product is \(\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out what shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates. The options are a line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point in space is defined by these three components.

The equation given is \( z = c \). That means, for any point on this surface, the z-coordinate is fixed at the constant value \( c \). So, regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is equal to \( c \), the point lies on this surface.

Let me visualize this. If I fix \( z = c \), what does that look like in 3D space? Well, in Cartesian coordinates, \( z = c \) would be a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But since we're in cylindrical coordinates, does this change anything? I don't think so because the z-coordinate is the same in both systems. So, in cylindrical coordinates, \( z = c \) should still represent a plane.

Wait, but let me make sure. In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary freely as long as \( z \) is fixed. So, for any radius \( r \) and any angle \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is \( c \), the point is on the surface. That sounds like a flat, two-dimensional surface extending infinitely in the radial and angular directions, which is exactly what a plane is.

Let me consider the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. A line would require two coordinates to be fixed, but here only \( z \) is fixed. A circle would have both \( r \) and \( \theta \) varying in a way that forms a closed loop, but here \( r \) can be any value, so it's not a circle. A sphere would require all three coordinates to satisfy a certain equation, like \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \), which isn't the case here. A cylinder would have a fixed \( r \), but here \( r \) can vary. A cone would have a relationship between \( r \) and \( z \), like \( z = kr \), which isn't the case here either.

So, yeah, I think it's a plane. The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates defines a plane parallel to the xy-plane at a height \( c \). Therefore, the correct answer should be (C) Rovinná plocha, which translates to ""plane"" in English.
</think>

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates fixes the height \( z \) at a constant value \( c \), allowing \( r \) and \( \theta \) to vary freely. This describes a flat, two-dimensional surface extending infinitely in the radial and angular directions, which is a plane.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is (3, 2, 6). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors has a magnitude equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can solve for sin(theta) and then find theta.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector (3, 2, 6). The magnitude is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 is 13, plus 36 is 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49), which is 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.

Now, plugging into the formula: 7 = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta). We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so that's 2 * 7 * sin(theta) = 14 sin(theta). So, 7 = 14 sin(theta). Dividing both sides by 14, sin(theta) = 7/14 = 1/2.

So, sin(theta) is 1/2. Now, I need to find theta such that sin(theta) = 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) is 1/2, and sin(150°) is also 1/2. But since we're looking for the smallest angle between the vectors, it should be the acute angle, which is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me double-check. The cross product magnitude gives us the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors, and the angle between them affects that area. Since sin(theta) is positive, theta is between 0 and 180 degrees. The smallest angle would indeed be 30 degrees because 150 degrees is the obtuse angle, and we want the acute one.

So, putting it all together, the smallest angle between vectors a and b is 30 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)
\]
we substitute the known values:
\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin(\theta)
\]
\[
7 = 14 \sin(\theta)
\]
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) such that \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) is either \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we need the smallest angle, we choose \(30^\circ\).

Thus, the smallest angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a function f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015, and another function g(x) which is f(x + 5). I need to find the sum of the roots of g(x). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for any polynomial, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial like f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, for f(x), the sum of its roots would be -(-49)/1 = 49. But wait, the question is about g(x), which is f(x + 5). So, I need to figure out how shifting the function affects its roots and their sum.

Let me recall that if g(x) = f(x + 5), then the graph of g is just the graph of f shifted 5 units to the left. That means if f(x) has roots at x = r1, r2, r3, then g(x) will have roots at x = r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5. So, each root of f is shifted left by 5 units to become a root of g.

Therefore, the roots of g(x) are each 5 less than the roots of f(x). So, if the sum of the roots of f is 49, then the sum of the roots of g should be 49 - 5 - 5 - 5, which is 49 - 15 = 34. Wait, is that right? Let me check.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about expanding g(x) = f(x + 5) and then using Vieta's formula on g(x). Let me try that approach to verify.

So, f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Then, f(x + 5) would be (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, (x + 5)³. I know that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So, (x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, -49(x + 5)². Let's compute (x + 5)² first: that's x² + 10x + 25. Multiply by -49: -49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, 623(x + 5) is 623x + 3115.

And finally, subtract 2015.

Now, let's add all these together:

First term: x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125

Second term: -49x² - 490x - 1225

Third term: +623x + 3115

Fourth term: -2015

Now, let's combine like terms.

Start with x³: only one term, so x³.

Next, x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = (15 - 49)x² = -34x².

Next, x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 is 208. So, 208x.

Constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100

-1100 + 3115 = 2015

2015 - 2015 = 0

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, so g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. So, in standard form, it's x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0.

Now, using Vieta's formula for the sum of roots, which is -b/a, where a is the coefficient of x³ and b is the coefficient of x². Here, a = 1, b = -34. So, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34.

So, that matches my initial thought. The sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that shifting the function f(x) by 5 units to the left affects each root by subtracting 5. So, if the original sum of roots for f(x) is 49, then each root is decreased by 5, so the total sum decreases by 3*5=15, giving 49 - 15 = 34.

Either way, I get the same answer, so I feel confident that 34 is the correct sum of the roots of g(x).

**Final Answer**
The sum of the roots of \( g \) is \boxed{34}.
</think>

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \).

First, we recognize that the sum of the roots of a polynomial can be found using Vieta's formulas. For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the sum of its roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \), where \( a \) is the coefficient of \( x^3 \) and \( b \) is the coefficient of \( x^2 \). For \( f(x) \), this sum is \( -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are each 5 units less than the roots of \( f(x) \). Therefore, if the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is thus \( (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 \).

Given that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \( 49 - 15 = 34 \).

To verify, we can expand \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \):

1. Compute \( (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 \).
2. Compute \( -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225 \).
3. Compute \( 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115 \).
4. Subtract 2015.

Combining all terms:
- \( x^3 \)
- \( 15x^2 - 49x^2 = -34x^2 \)
- \( 75x - 490x + 623x = 208x \)
- Constants: \( 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015 = 0 \)

Thus, \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \). Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{-34}{1} = 34 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: compute the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that trigonometric identities often help simplify expressions like this. Let me recall some identities that might be useful here. I know that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps yet. Maybe I can express everything in terms of sine or cosine only. Alternatively, I remember that \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\) and \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\). Let me try that:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Wait, that simplifies to:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that's helpful. Maybe I should look for some angle relationships or complementary angles. Let me think about the angles given: 10°, 20°, and 40°. I notice that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, and 10° + 20° + 40° = 70°, which isn't a standard angle, but maybe there's a pattern or identity that connects these.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\) or something similar. Let me recall that \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\). Maybe if I set \(\theta = 10^\circ\), then \(3\theta = 30^\circ\), which is a known angle. Let me try that.

Let’s compute \(\tan 30^\circ\). I know that \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\). So, using the identity:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
(3t - t^3)\sqrt{3} = 1 - 3t^2
\]

Let me expand the left side:

\[
3\sqrt{3} t - \sqrt{3} t^3 = 1 - 3t^2
\]

Bring all terms to one side:

\[
-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3\sqrt{3} t + 3t^2 - 1 = 0
\]

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in terms of \(t\). Maybe I can factor this or find a substitution. Let me rearrange the terms:

\[
-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3t^2 + 3\sqrt{3} t - 1 = 0
\]

This looks complicated. Maybe I can factor out a common term or use substitution. Let me try to factor by grouping:

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:

\[
(-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3t^2) + (3\sqrt{3} t - 1) = 0
\]

Factor out \(t^2\) from the first group:

\[
t^2(-\sqrt{3} t + 3) + (3\sqrt{3} t - 1) = 0
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can let \(u = t\sqrt{3}\), so \(t = \frac{u}{\sqrt{3}}\). Let me substitute that into the equation:

First, compute each term:

- \(t = \frac{u}{\sqrt{3}}\)
- \(t^2 = \frac{u^2}{3}\)
- \(t^3 = \frac{u^3}{3\sqrt{3}}\)

Substituting into the equation:

\[
-\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{u^3}{3\sqrt{3}}\right) + 3\left(\frac{u^2}{3}\right) + 3\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{u}{\sqrt{3}}\right) - 1 = 0
\]

Simplify each term:

- First term: \(-\sqrt{3} \times \frac{u^3}{3\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{u^3}{3}\)
- Second term: \(3 \times \frac{u^2}{3} = u^2\)
- Third term: \(3\sqrt{3} \times \frac{u}{\sqrt{3}} = 3u\)
- Fourth term: \(-1\)

So the equation becomes:

\[
-\frac{u^3}{3} + u^2 + 3u - 1 = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
-u^3 + 3u^2 + 9u - 3 = 0
\]

Hmm, still a cubic equation, but maybe it's easier to factor now. Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 3 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±3.

Let me test u=1:

\[
-1 + 3 + 9 - 3 = 8 ≠ 0
\]

u=3:

\[
-27 + 27 + 27 - 3 = 24 ≠ 0
\]

u=-1:

\[
1 + 3 - 9 - 3 = -8 ≠ 0
\]

u=-3:

\[
27 + 27 - 27 - 3 = 24 ≠ 0
\]

Hmm, none of these work. Maybe this substitution didn't help. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe instead of trying to find \(\tan 10^\circ\), I can relate the angles 10°, 20°, and 40° through some identity. Let me think about the sum of angles or complementary angles.

I know that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all related through doubling: 10°, 20°=2×10°, 40°=4×10°. Maybe I can use multiple-angle identities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\) or \(\cos 3\theta\). Let me recall that \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\). Maybe that can help.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about the original expression again:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

I wonder if there's a way to express all terms in terms of a single trigonometric function or relate them through some identity.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, expressions like this can be simplified by using the identity \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2}\) and \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2}\). Maybe that can help.

Let me try that. Let's rewrite each term:

First term: \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}\)

Second term: \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ}\)

Third term: \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}\)

So, substituting back, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}

Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I have three terms, each with denominators involving cosines of 20°, 40°, and 80°. Maybe I can find a way to combine these or find a common pattern.

I remember that \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 10^\circ\), since \(\cos(90^\circ - \theta) = \sin \theta\). Similarly, \(\cos 40^\circ = \sin 50^\circ\), and \(\cos 20^\circ = \sin 70^\circ\). But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\cos 3\theta\). Let me recall that \(\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta\). Maybe that can help relate the angles.

Wait, 20°, 40°, and 80° are all multiples of 20°, which is 2×10°, 4×10°, 8×10°. Maybe I can express them in terms of 10°, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\cos A + \cos B\), but I have denominators here, not numerators. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: maybe I can use the identity for \(\tan \theta\) in terms of sine and cosine. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)\). So, \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). Maybe that can help.

But I'm not sure yet. Let me think about another approach. Maybe I can use the identity for the sum of squares of cosecants or secants.

Wait, I recall that in some cases, the sum of squares can be related to the roots of certain equations. For example, if I can find an equation whose roots are \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 20^\circ\), and \(\tan 40^\circ\), then perhaps I can find the sum of their squares or something similar.

But that might be too vague. Let me try to think differently.

Wait, another thought: perhaps I can use the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\) or \(\cos 3\theta\) to relate these angles. Let me try with \(\sin 3\theta\).

Let me compute \(\sin 30^\circ\), which is 0.5. Using the identity:

\[
\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta
\]

So, for \(\theta = 10^\circ\):

\[
\sin 30^\circ = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ
\]

Which gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ
\]

Let me denote \(s = \sin 10^\circ\). Then:

\[
4s^3 - 3s + \frac{1}{2} = 0
\]

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in \(s\). Maybe I can solve for \(s\), but that might not be straightforward. Alternatively, perhaps I can find a relationship between \(\sin 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ\).

Wait, I remember that \(\sin 20^\circ = 2\sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = 2\sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ = 4\sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ \cos 20^\circ\). Maybe that can help express everything in terms of \(\sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 10^\circ\), but I'm not sure yet.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\sin A + \sin B\) or \(\cos A + \cos B\), but again, I'm not sure.

Wait, another idea: perhaps I can use the identity for \(\tan \theta + \tan \phi\) or something similar. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ\). But I don't know if that's helpful here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the expression as a sum of secants and cosecants and try to find a common denominator or something. Let me try that.

But that might get too messy. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\tan \theta \tan (60^\circ - \theta) \tan (60^\circ + \theta) = \tan 3\theta\). Let me recall that.

Yes, I think that's a valid identity. Let me check for \(\theta = 10^\circ\):

"Okay, so I have this problem here: ""Koľko strán by mal konvexný mnohouholník, ak súčet všetkých jeho vnútorných uhlov okrem jedného je 1070°?"" Which translates to: ""How many sides should a convex polygon have if the sum of all its interior angles except one is 1070°?""

Hmm, let me think about this step by step. I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2)*180°. So, if the sum of all but one angle is 1070°, that means the total sum should be 1070° plus the measure of that one missing angle.

But wait, since it's a convex polygon, all interior angles must be less than 180°, right? So, the missing angle must be less than 180°. That gives me a clue about the possible value of the total sum.

Let me denote the total sum as S. So, S = 1070° + x, where x is the measure of the missing angle, and x < 180°. But I also know that S must be equal to (n-2)*180°. So, I can write:

(n-2)*180° = 1070° + x

Since x is less than 180°, I can say that:

(n-2)*180° < 1070° + 180°
(n-2)*180° < 1250°

Let me solve for n:

Divide both sides by 180°:
n - 2 < 1250° / 180°
n - 2 < 6.944...

So, n < 8.944. Since n must be an integer, n ≤ 8.

But wait, let's also consider the lower bound. The total sum S must be greater than 1070°, because we're adding a positive angle x. So:

(n-2)*180° > 1070°

Let me solve this inequality:

n - 2 > 1070° / 180°
n - 2 > 5.944...

So, n > 7.944. Since n must be an integer, n ≥ 8.

Putting both inequalities together, n must be 8.

Wait, let me check that. If n=8, then the total sum S = (8-2)*180° = 6*180° = 1080°. So, the missing angle x = S - 1070° = 1080° - 1070° = 10°. That makes sense because 10° is less than 180°, so it's a valid convex polygon.

But just to be thorough, let me check n=7. If n=7, then S = (7-2)*180° = 5*180° = 900°. Then x = 900° - 1070° = negative, which doesn't make sense because angles can't be negative. So n can't be 7.

What about n=9? S = (9-2)*180° = 7*180° = 1260°. Then x = 1260° - 1070° = 190°, which is more than 180°, so that's not possible for a convex polygon. So n can't be 9.

Therefore, the only possible value is n=8.
</think>

The convex polygon must have 8 sides because the sum of its interior angles is 1080°, and subtracting 1070° leaves a valid angle of 10°, which is less than 180°.

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find a unique odd integer t such that 0 < t < 23, and t + 2 is the multiplicative inverse of t modulo 23. Hmm, that sounds a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, let me recall what a multiplicative inverse modulo 23 means. If t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23, that means when I multiply t by t + 2, the result should be congruent to 1 modulo 23. In other words, t*(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. So, I can write that as an equation:

t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23.

Expanding that, it becomes:

t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23.

Hmm, so that's a quadratic congruence. Maybe I can rearrange it to make it easier to solve. Let me subtract 1 from both sides:

t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23.

So, I have the quadratic equation t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. I need to find integer solutions t where 0 < t < 23 and t is odd.

I remember that solving quadratic congruences can sometimes be done by completing the square or using the quadratic formula modulo a prime. Since 23 is a prime number, that might be helpful.

Let me try completing the square. The equation is t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23. To complete the square, I can write it as:

t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23.

Adding 1 to both sides to complete the square:

t² + 2t + 1 ≡ 2 mod 23.

Which simplifies to:

(t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23.

So, now I have (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23. That means that t + 1 is a square root of 2 modulo 23. I need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23.

I remember that for a prime modulus p, the number of solutions to x² ≡ a mod p is either 0 or 2, unless a ≡ 0 mod p, which isn't the case here. So, there should be two solutions for t + 1, which would give me two possible values for t. But the problem says there's a unique odd integer t, so maybe one of the solutions is even and the other is odd, and we need the odd one.

So, first, I need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23. How do I find square roots modulo a prime? I think one method is to use Tonelli-Shanks algorithm, but that might be a bit complicated. Alternatively, since 23 is a small prime, maybe I can just test numbers to see which ones square to 2 mod 23.

Let me list the squares modulo 23:

1² = 1 mod 23

2² = 4 mod 23

3² = 9 mod 23

4² = 16 mod 23

5² = 25 ≡ 2 mod 23. Oh, wait, 5² is 25, which is 2 mod 23. So, 5 is a square root of 2 mod 23.

But since we're working modulo 23, the other square root would be -5 mod 23, which is 18, because 23 - 5 = 18. Let me check: 18² = 324. Dividing 324 by 23: 23*14=322, so 324 - 322 = 2. So, 18² ≡ 2 mod 23. Yep, that works.

So, the square roots of 2 mod 23 are 5 and 18. Therefore, t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 or t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23.

Solving for t:

Case 1: t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 4 mod 23.

Case 2: t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 17 mod 23.

So, the possible solutions are t = 4 and t = 17. But the problem specifies that t must be an odd integer. So, t = 4 is even, and t = 17 is odd. Therefore, the unique odd integer t satisfying the conditions is 17.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure. If t = 17, then t + 2 = 19. Is 19 the inverse of 17 modulo 23?

Let's compute 17*19 mod 23. 17*19 is 323. Dividing 323 by 23: 23*14=322, so 323 - 322 = 1. So, 17*19 ≡ 1 mod 23. That checks out.

Just to be thorough, let me check t = 4 as well. t + 2 = 6. Is 6 the inverse of 4 mod 23? 4*6 = 24, which is 1 mod 23. So, yes, 6 is the inverse of 4. But since we need an odd t, 4 is even, so we discard it.

Therefore, the unique odd integer t is 17.

**Final Answer**
The unique odd integer \( t \) is \boxed{17}.
</think>

To find a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the multiplicative inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by noting that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Completing the square, we get:

\[ (t + 1)^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We need to find the square roots of 2 modulo 23. Testing small numbers, we find that:

\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 18^2 \equiv 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the square roots of 2 modulo 23 are 5 and 18. This gives us two possible solutions for \( t + 1 \):

1. \( t + 1 \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) which implies \( t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \)
2. \( t + 1 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) which implies \( t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \)

Since \( t \) must be odd, we discard \( t = 4 \) (which is even) and keep \( t = 17 \) (which is odd). Verifying, we find that \( 17 \times 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), confirming that 19 is indeed the inverse of 17 modulo 23.

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is \(x\). Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the inverse cotangent function, giving me an angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\). 

Wait a second, I think there's a relationship between \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). Let me recall... Oh yeah, I remember that \(\cot^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) for \(x > 0\). So, in this case, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) would be equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Is that right? Let me verify.

If I let \(\theta = \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), then \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}\), which means \(\tan(\theta) = x\). Therefore, \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). So yes, that's correct. So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). 

So, substituting that back into the original equation, the argument inside the sine function becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x)\), which is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin\left(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Alright, now I need to solve for \(x\). Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so that the equation becomes:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

I know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\). So, substituting that in:

\[
2 \sin\theta \cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}
\]

But since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), I can express \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of \(x\). Let me draw a right triangle where \(\theta\) is one of the angles. In this triangle, the opposite side to \(\theta\) is \(x\), and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\).

Therefore, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Plugging these into the equation:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So, we have:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

To solve for \(x\), I can cross-multiply:

\[
2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)
\]
\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Bringing all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Now, this is a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). 

But wait, I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be restrictions on the domain or range.

Let me recall the domains and ranges:

- \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is defined for all real numbers \(x\), and its range is \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\).
- \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is also defined for all real numbers except zero, and its range is \((0, \pi)\).

But in our case, since we have \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), which is equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), and since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is only defined for real numbers, \(x\) can be any real number except zero? Wait, no, actually, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is defined for \(x \neq 0\), but since \(\frac{1}{x}\) is just another real number, except when \(x = 0\), which is undefined.

But in our solutions, \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), both are positive numbers because \(2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 2.828, so \(3 - 2.828\) is approximately 0.172, which is positive. So, both solutions are positive, which is fine because \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) are defined for positive \(x\).

Wait, but actually, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is defined for all \(x \neq 0\), regardless of the sign. So, if \(x\) were negative, \(\frac{1}{x}\) would be negative, and \(\cot^{-1}\) of a negative number is still defined, but it would give an angle in a different quadrant. Hmm, but in our case, since we have \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), does that hold for negative \(x\)?

Wait, let me think. If \(x\) is negative, then \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) would give an angle in the fourth quadrant, between \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) and 0. On the other hand, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) when \(x\) is negative would be \(\cot^{-1}\) of a negative number, which is in the second quadrant, between \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\pi\). So, in that case, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is negative, and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is positive, so their sum would be... Hmm, but in our original equation, we have \(\sin\) of that sum. The sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, so maybe negative \(x\) could also be solutions?

Wait, but in our quadratic equation, we got two positive solutions. So, does that mean negative solutions are not possible? Or did I make a mistake in assuming that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\) for all \(x\)?

Let me double-check that identity. I think it's only true for positive \(x\). Because for negative \(x\), \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) would be \(\pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\), right? Because \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) for negative \(y\) is \(\pi + \tan^{-1}(y)\). So, if \(x\) is negative, then \(\frac{1}{x}\) is negative, so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \pi + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). But \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is equal to \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) for positive \(x\), but for negative \(x\), it's different.

Wait, this is getting a bit confusing. Maybe I should approach it differently. Let me consider both cases: \(x > 0\) and \(x < 0\).

Case 1: \(x > 0\)

In this case, as I initially thought, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the original equation becomes \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\), which led us to the quadratic equation and solutions \(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\). Both of these are positive, so they are valid in this case.

Case 2: \(x < 0\)

Here, \(\frac{1}{x}\) is negative, so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is equal to \(\pi + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). But \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) for negative \(x\) is equal to \(-\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\). So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \pi - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right)\).

But \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{|x|}\right) = \cot^{-1}(|x|)\), which is equal to \(\frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(|x|)\). So, substituting back:

\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \pi - \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(|x|) \right) = \frac{\pi}{2} + \tan^{-1}(|x|)
\]

Therefore, the argument inside the sine function becomes:

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x) + \frac{\pi}{2} + \tan^{-1}(|x|)
\]

But since \(x < 0\), \(\tan^{-1}(x) = -\tan^{-1}(|x|)\). So, substituting that in:

\[
-\tan^{-1}(|x|) + \frac{\pi}{2} + \tan^{-1}(|x|) = \frac{\pi}{2}
\]

So, the argument simplifies to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), and the sine of that is 1. But in our original equation, the sine is equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), which is not 1. Therefore, for \(x < 0\), the equation reduces to \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\), which is not equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, there are no solutions for \(x < 0\).

So, only the positive solutions \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are valid.

Wait, but let me check \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 2.828, \(3 - 2.828\) is approximately 0.172, which is positive, so that's fine. So, both solutions are positive and valid.

Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Just to make sure, let me plug one of them back into the original equation to verify.

Let's take \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). First, compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\tan\theta = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). I know that \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is actually \(\tan(75^\circ)\) because \(\tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{1 - 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{3})^2}{9 - 3} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{6} = \frac{12 + 6\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2 + \sqrt{3}\). Wait, that's not \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \(\sin(2\theta)\) where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Using the identity \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{2\tan\theta}{1 + \tan^2\theta}\). So,","[Eq(sin(2*theta), (2*tan(theta))/(tan(theta)**2 + 1)), '\\sin(2\\theta) = \\frac{2\\tan\\theta}{1 + \\tan^2\\theta}']",3 \pm 2 \sqrt{2},"[2, '2']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two lines given in vector form, and I need to find the distance between them. The lines are parallel, which is good because I remember that the distance between two parallel lines is constant, so I don't have to worry about them getting closer or farther apart at different points. 

First, let me write down the equations of the lines to make sure I have them correctly. The first line is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

And the second line is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Hmm, I notice that the direction vectors of both lines are given. For the first line, it's \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), and for the second line, it's \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Wait a second, the direction vector of the second line looks like it's just twice the direction vector of the first line. Let me check:

If I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get:

\[
2 \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Yes, that's exactly the direction vector of the second line. So, that confirms that the lines are parallel because their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. Good, so they are indeed parallel, which is a prerequisite for the distance formula I remember.

Now, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I think the formula involves taking a vector connecting any two points on the lines and then projecting it onto a vector that's perpendicular to the direction of the lines. The length of that projection should give the distance. Alternatively, I remember that the distance can be calculated using the cross product. Let me recall the exact formula.

I think the distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:

\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|}
\]

Where \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the lines, and \(\vec{w}\) is the vector connecting any two points on the two lines. So, first, I need to find such a vector \(\vec{w}\).

Let me pick a point on each line. For the first line, when \(t = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). For the second line, when \(u = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). So, the vector connecting these two points is:

\[
\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Okay, so \(\vec{w}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\). Now, the direction vector \(\vec{v}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). I need to compute the cross product of \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\).

Let me recall how to compute the cross product. For two vectors \(\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\), the cross product \(\vec{a} \times \vec{b}\) is:

\[
\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, applying this to \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\):

\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} (2)(5) - (-2)(7) \\ (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) \\ (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Wait, let me compute each component step by step to avoid mistakes.

First component (i-direction):

\[
(2)(5) - (-2)(7) = 10 - (-14) = 10 + 14 = 24
\]

Second component (j-direction):

\[
(-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6
\]

Wait, hold on, the formula for the j-component is \(a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3\). So, plugging in:

\(a_3 = -2\), \(b_1 = -8\), \(a_1 = 2\), \(b_3 = 5\).

So,

\[
(-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6
\]

Third component (k-direction):

\[
(2)(7) - (-9)(-8) = 14 - 72 = -58
\]

So, putting it all together, the cross product is:

\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 24 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude \(|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|\) is calculated as:

\[
\sqrt{24^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

24 squared is 576,

6 squared is 36,

58 squared is 3364.

So, adding them up:

576 + 36 = 612,

612 + 3364 = 3976.

So, the magnitude is \(\sqrt{3976}\).

Hmm, let me see if I can simplify that. Let's factor 3976.

Divide by 4: 3976 ÷ 4 = 994.

994 ÷ 2 = 497.

497 is a prime number? Let me check: 497 ÷ 7 = 71, because 7*70=490, plus 7 is 497. So, 497 = 7*71.

So, 3976 = 4 * 2 * 7 * 71.

So, \(\sqrt{3976} = \sqrt{4 * 994} = 2\sqrt{994}\). Wait, but 994 is 2*497, which is 2*7*71. So, it's 2*sqrt(2*7*71). I don't think this simplifies further, so maybe I can leave it as \(\sqrt{3976}\) or factor it as 2*sqrt(994). Either way, I can compute the numerical value if needed, but perhaps I can keep it symbolic for now.

Next, I need the magnitude of the direction vector \(\vec{v}\). The direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Its magnitude is:

\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

So, putting it all together, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{3976}}{\sqrt{89}}
\]

Simplify this expression. Let's see, 3976 divided by 89. Let me compute that.

89 times 44 is 3916 (since 89*40=3560, 89*4=356; 3560+356=3916). Then, 3976 - 3916 = 60. So, 3976 = 89*44 + 60. Hmm, that doesn't seem helpful. Maybe factor 3976 and 89.

Wait, 89 is a prime number. Let me check if 89 divides 3976.

Divide 3976 by 89:

89*44 = 3916, as above.

3976 - 3916 = 60.

60 ÷ 89 is less than 1, so 3976 = 89*44 + 60. So, 3976 is not a multiple of 89. Therefore, the fraction \(\sqrt{3976}/\sqrt{89}\) can be written as \(\sqrt{3976/89}\).

Compute 3976 ÷ 89:

Let me do this division step by step.

89 goes into 397 how many times? 89*4=356, 89*5=445 which is too big. So, 4 times. 4*89=356.

Subtract 356 from 397: 397 - 356 = 41.

Bring down the 6: 416.

89 goes into 416 how many times? 89*4=356, 89*5=445. So, 4 times. 4*89=356.

Subtract 356 from 416: 416 - 356 = 60.

Bring down the next digit, but since there are no more digits, we have a remainder of 60.

So, 3976 ÷ 89 = 44 with a remainder of 60, which is 44 + 60/89.

So, 3976/89 = 44 + 60/89 = approximately 44.674...

But since we have square roots, maybe we can write it as:

\[
\sqrt{\frac{3976}{89}} = \sqrt{44.674...}
\]

But that's not very helpful. Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in computing the cross product or the vector \(\vec{w}\). Let me double-check.

First, vector \(\vec{w}\) is from point (3, -10, 1) to (-5, -3, 6). So, subtracting:

x: -5 - 3 = -8

y: -3 - (-10) = 7

z: 6 - 1 = 5

So, \(\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\). That seems correct.

Cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\):

i component: (2)(5) - (-2)(7) = 10 + 14 = 24

j component: (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6

k component: (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) = 14 - 72 = -58

So, cross product is \(\begin{pmatrix} 24 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}\). That seems correct.

Magnitude squared is 24² + 6² + (-58)² = 576 + 36 + 3364 = 3976. Correct.

Magnitude of \(\vec{v}\) is sqrt(4 + 81 + 4) = sqrt(89). Correct.

So, the distance is sqrt(3976)/sqrt(89). Let me see if I can simplify sqrt(3976/89). Let's compute 3976 divided by 89:

As above, 89*44 = 3916, 3976 - 3916 = 60, so 3976 = 89*44 + 60. So, 3976/89 = 44 + 60/89.

So, sqrt(44 + 60/89). Hmm, that's approximately sqrt(44.674) ≈ 6.683. But maybe I can write it as sqrt(3976)/sqrt(89) or rationalize it.

Alternatively, perhaps I can factor 3976 and 89 to see if there's a common factor. 89 is prime, so let's see if 89 divides 3976.

Wait, 89*44 = 3916, as above, and 3976 - 3916 = 60, so 89 doesn't divide 3976 exactly. So, the fraction can't be simplified further in terms of factoring out squares.

Alternatively, maybe I can write sqrt(3976)/sqrt(89) as sqrt(3976/89). Let me compute 3976 divided by 89:

3976 ÷ 89:

89*44 = 3916

"Na začiatku si určíme rozmer obdĺžnika. Jeho šírka je rozdiel x-ových súradníc dvoch protiľahlych bodov, teda 5 - (-5) = 10. Výška je rozdiel y-ových súradníc, tedy 4 - (-4) = 8.

Ďalej si uvedomíme, že počet bodov s celočíselnými súradnicami na obvode obdĺžnika sa vypočíta ako 2*(šírka + výška) - 4. V tomto prípade je to 2*(10 + 8) - 4 = 32.

Následne vypočítame celkový počet bodov s celočíselnými súradnicami včetně vnútra a obvodu. Tento počet je (šírka + 1)*(výška + 1) = 11*9 = 99.

Ako nakoniec získame počet bodov striktne vo vnútri, odčítame počet bodov na obvode od celkového počtu. Teda 99 - 32 = 67.

Na určenie počtu bodov s celočíselnými súradnicami, ktoré sú striktne vo vnútri daného obdĺžniku, postupujeme nasledovne:

1. **Určenie rozmerov obdĺžnika:**
   - Šírka obdĺžnika je rozdiel x-ových súradníc dvoch protiľahlych bodov:

     5 - (-5) = 10

   - Výška obdĺžnika je rozdiel y-ových súradníc dvoch protiľahlych bodov:
     \[
     4 - (-4) = 8
     \]

2. **Výpočet počtu bodov na obvode obdĺžnika:**
   - Počet bodov na obvode sa vypočíta ako:
     \[
     2 \times (\text{šírka} + \text{výška}) - 4 = 2 \times (10 + 8) - 4 = 32

3. **Výpočet celkového počtu bodov včetně vnútra a obvodu:**
   - Celkový počet bodov je:

4. **Výpočet počtu bodov striktne vo vnútri:**
   - Od celkového počtu bodov odčítame počet bodov na obvode:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) cross (3c + a). I'm given the cross products of a, b, and c with each other: a cross b, a cross c, and b cross c. Hmm, let me write those down to keep track.

Given:
- a × b = [6, -7, 3]
- a × c = [4, 7, 2]
- b × c = [1, -7, 18]

I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, cross product is distributive over vector addition, right? So I can expand this expression using the distributive property. Let me recall the formula for cross product distribution:

(u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x

So applying that to (2b - a) × (3c + a), I can expand it as:

2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a

Wait, let me make sure I distribute correctly. Let me denote u = 2b, v = -a, w = 3c, x = a. So it's (u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x.

So substituting back:

2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a

Simplify each term:

First term: 2b × 3c = 6(b × c)
Second term: 2b × a = 2(b × a)
Third term: (-a) × 3c = -3(a × c)
Fourth term: (-a) × a = - (a × a)

Now, I know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so the fourth term is zero. So we can ignore that term.

So now, the expression simplifies to:

6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c)

Now, let's recall that cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that b × a = - (a × b). So, 2(b × a) is equal to -2(a × b). Similarly, a × c is given, so we can substitute that.

So substituting:

6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c)

Now, let's plug in the given cross products:

6 * [1, -7, 18] - 2 * [6, -7, 3] - 3 * [4, 7, 2]

Let me compute each of these scalar multiplications first.

First term: 6 * [1, -7, 18] = [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108]

Second term: -2 * [6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]

Third term: -3 * [4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6]

Now, add these three vectors together:

First, let's write them down:

[6, -42, 108] + [-12, 14, -6] + [-12, -21, -6]

Let me add the first components: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 -12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18

Second components: -42 + 14 + (-21) = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49

Third components: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96

So putting it all together, the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96]

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First term: 6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108) – correct.

Second term: -2*(6, -7, 3) = (-12, 14, -6) – correct.

Third term: -3*(4,7,2) = (-12, -21, -6) – correct.

Adding the first components: 6 -12 -12 = -18 – correct.

Second components: -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49 – correct.

Third components: 108 -6 -6 = 96 – correct.

So, the final result is [-18, -49, 96]. Hmm, let me just make sure I didn't mix up any signs.

Wait, in the expansion, I had 6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c). So substituting the given cross products:

6*(1, -7, 18) is correct.

-2*(6, -7, 3) is correct because b × a = -a × b, so 2*(b × a) = -2*(a × b).

Similarly, -3*(a × c) is correct.

So, all the signs seem to be correct. So, adding them up as I did, the result is [-18, -49, 96].

I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap the steps to ensure I didn't skip anything:

1. Expanded (2b - a) × (3c + a) using distributive property.
2. Simplified each term, noting that a × a = 0.
3. Replaced b × a with -a × b.
4. Substituted the given cross products.
5. Performed scalar multiplications.
6. Added the resulting vectors component-wise.
7. Double-checked each step for errors.

Everything seems to check out. So, I'm confident that the result is [-18, -49, 96].

**Final Answer**
The result of $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

Given the cross products of vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to compute \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

First, we expand the expression using the distributive property of the cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})\)
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\)
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})\)
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\)

Substituting the given cross products:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})
\]

Calculating each term:

1. \(6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(-2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
3. \(-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)

"Okay, so I have this problem about a trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. They also told me that AC is perpendicular to CD, and that AC bisects angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me draw a rough sketch. Since AD is parallel to BC, ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC. Let me label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, sides AB and CD are the non-parallel sides. Now, AC is one of the diagonals, and it's perpendicular to CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD, which means angle BAC is equal to angle CAD.

Let me note down the given information:

1. AD || BC
2. AC ⊥ CD
3. AC bisects angle BAD
4. Area of trapezoid ABCD is 42
5. Find area of triangle ACD

I think I should assign some variables to the sides to make this more concrete. Let me denote:

- Let’s let AD = a, BC = b, since they are the two bases.
- Let’s denote the height of the trapezoid as h. Since AD || BC, the distance between these two sides is the height.
- The area of the trapezoid is given by (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42.

So, (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42 => (a + b)*h = 84.

Now, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle with right angle at C. So, in triangle ACD, AC is one leg, CD is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse.

Wait, but AC is also a diagonal of the trapezoid. Hmm, maybe I can express AC in terms of the sides of the trapezoid.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC = angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAD as 2θ, so each of the angles BAC and CAD is θ.

Since AD || BC, the consecutive angles are supplementary. So, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180°, but I'm not sure if that's immediately helpful.

Let me think about triangle ACD. It's a right triangle, so by the Pythagorean theorem, AC² + CD² = AD².

But I don't know AC or CD yet. Maybe I can express AC in terms of the sides of the trapezoid.

Alternatively, since AC is a diagonal, maybe I can use the properties of trapezoids. In a trapezoid, the length of the diagonal can be found using the formula:

AC² = AB² + BC² - 2*AB*BC*cos(angle ABC)

But I don't know angle ABC or AB or BC. Hmm, maybe that's not the way to go.

Wait, since AC bisects angle BAD, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem. In triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD.

But wait, is BD a side? No, BD is the other diagonal. Hmm, maybe I need to consider triangle ABD with angle bisector AC.

Wait, actually, in triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so by the angle bisector theorem:

AB / AD = BC / CD

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the angle bisector theorem. It states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it should divide side BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. So, if AC intersects BD at point E, then BE/ED = AB/AD.

But I don't know where AC intersects BD, so maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AC is perpendicular to CD, maybe I can set up the coordinates accordingly.

Let me assume that AD is horizontal for simplicity. So, point A is at (0,0), and point D is at (a,0). Since AD || BC, point B must be somewhere above A, and point C somewhere above D.

But AC is perpendicular to CD. So, vector AC is perpendicular to vector CD.

Let me denote coordinates:

- A: (0,0)
- D: (a,0)
- Let’s let point C be at (c,d)
- Then, since AD || BC, point B must be at (b,d), because BC is parallel to AD, which is horizontal.

Wait, is that correct? If AD is from (0,0) to (a,0), then BC should also be horizontal, so if C is at (c,d), then B must be at (c - (a - 0), d) = (c - a, d). Wait, no, that might not necessarily be the case.

Wait, actually, since AD is parallel to BC, the vector AD is (a,0), so vector BC should also be (a,0). So, if point B is at (x,y), then point C would be at (x + a, y). Hmm, that might make more sense.

So, let me adjust:

- A: (0,0)
- D: (a,0)
- B: (x,y)
- C: (x + a, y)

So, BC is from (x,y) to (x + a, y), which is indeed parallel to AD, which is from (0,0) to (a,0).

Now, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(x + a, y). AC is perpendicular to CD. CD is from C(x + a, y) to D(a,0). So, vector AC is (x + a, y), and vector CD is (a - (x + a), 0 - y) = (-x, -y).

Since AC is perpendicular to CD, their dot product is zero:

AC • CD = (x + a)(-x) + (y)(-y) = -x(x + a) - y² = 0

So, -x² - a x - y² = 0 => x² + a x + y² = 0

Hmm, that's one equation.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. Angle BAD is the angle at point A between BA and AD. Since BA is from A(0,0) to B(x,y), and AD is from A(0,0) to D(a,0). So, angle BAD is the angle between vectors AB and AD.

Since AC bisects this angle, the direction of AC should make equal angles with AB and AD.

In terms of vectors, the angle between AC and AB should equal the angle between AC and AD.

The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cosθ = (u • v) / (|u||v|)

So, the angle between AC and AB is equal to the angle between AC and AD.

Let me compute the vectors:

- Vector AB is (x, y)
- Vector AD is (a, 0)
- Vector AC is (x + a, y)

So, the cosine of the angle between AC and AB is:

[(x + a)x + y * y] / (|AC| |AB|) = [x(x + a) + y²] / (sqrt((x + a)² + y²) * sqrt(x² + y²))

Similarly, the cosine of the angle between AC and AD is:

[(x + a)a + y * 0] / (|AC| |AD|) = [a(x + a)] / (sqrt((x + a)² + y²) * a) = (x + a)/sqrt((x + a)² + y²)

Since these two cosines are equal (because the angles are equal), we have:

[x(x + a) + y²] / (sqrt((x + a)² + y²) * sqrt(x² + y²)) = (x + a)/sqrt((x + a)² + y²)

Simplify both sides:

Multiply both sides by sqrt((x + a)² + y²):

[x(x + a) + y²] / sqrt(x² + y²) = x + a

Multiply both sides by sqrt(x² + y²):

x(x + a) + y² = (x + a) sqrt(x² + y²)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

[x(x + a) + y²]^2 = (x + a)^2 (x² + y²)

Expand the left side:

[x(x + a) + y²]^2 = [x² + a x + y²]^2 = (x² + a x + y²)^2

Right side:

(x + a)^2 (x² + y²) = (x² + 2 a x + a²)(x² + y²)

So, expanding both sides:

Left side:

(x² + a x + y²)^2 = x^4 + 2 a x^3 + (a² + 2 y²) x² + 2 a y² x + y^4

Right side:

(x² + 2 a x + a²)(x² + y²) = x^4 + y² x² + 2 a x^3 + 2 a y² x + a² x² + a² y²

Now, set left side equal to right side:

x^4 + 2 a x^3 + (a² + 2 y²) x² + 2 a y² x + y^4 = x^4 + y² x² + 2 a x^3 + 2 a y² x + a² x² + a² y²

Subtract right side from left side:

(x^4 - x^4) + (2 a x^3 - 2 a x^3) + [(a² + 2 y²) x² - y² x² - a² x²] + (2 a y² x - 2 a y² x) + (y^4 - a² y²) = 0

Simplify term by term:

0 + 0 + [a² x² + 2 y² x² - y² x² - a² x²] + 0 + y^4 - a² y² = 0

Simplify inside the brackets:

(a² x² - a² x²) + (2 y² x² - y² x²) = 0 + y² x²

So, overall:

y² x² + y^4 - a² y² = 0

Factor out y²:

y² (x² + y² - a²) = 0

So, either y² = 0 or x² + y² - a² = 0

If y² = 0, then y = 0, but that would mean points B and C are on the x-axis, which would make the trapezoid degenerate (all points on a line). So, we discard y² = 0.

Thus, x² + y² - a² = 0 => x² + y² = a²

So, that's another equation: x² + y² = a²

Earlier, we had from the perpendicularity condition:

x² + a x + y² = 0

But since x² + y² = a², substitute into the first equation:

a² + a x = 0 => a x = -a² => x = -a

So, x = -a

So, from x = -a, and x² + y² = a², we have:

(-a)^2 + y² = a² => a² + y² = a² => y² = 0 => y = 0

Wait, that can't be right because y = 0 would make the trapezoid degenerate. Hmm, that suggests a contradiction. Did I make a mistake somewhere?

Let me check my steps.

We had:

From AC perpendicular to CD: x² + a x + y² = 0

From angle bisector: x² + y² = a²

Substituting x² + y² = a² into the first equation:

a² + a x = 0 => x = -a

Then, plugging back into x² + y² = a²:

(-a)^2 + y² = a² => a² + y² = a² => y² = 0 => y = 0

Hmm, that's a problem because y = 0 would mean points B and C are on the x-axis, making the trapezoid degenerate. So, perhaps my coordinate setup is flawed.

Wait, maybe I made a wrong assumption in the coordinate system. Let me try a different approach.

Instead of placing A at (0,0) and D at (a,0), maybe I should place A at (0,0) and AD along the x-axis, but let me define point B at (p, q) and point C at (r, q) since BC is parallel to AD, which is along the x-axis. So, BC is horizontal.

So, points:

- A: (0,0)
- D: (a,0)
- B: (p, q)
- C: (r, q)

Since AD || BC, which is along the x-axis, so BC is from (p, q) to (r, q), so vector BC is (r - p, 0). Vector AD is (a, 0). So, they are both horizontal, which is consistent.

Now, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(r, q). AC is perpendicular to CD. CD is from C(r, q) to D(a,0). So, vector CD is (a - r, -q). Vector AC is (r, q).

Their dot product should be zero:

(r)(a - r) + (q)(-q) = 0 => r(a - r) - q² = 0 => a r - r² - q² = 0

So, equation (1): a r - r² - q² = 0

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. Angle BAD is the angle at A between BA and AD.

Vector BA is from A to B: (p, q)
Vector AD is from A to D: (a, 0)

AC is the angle bisector, so the angle between BA and AC is equal to the angle between AD and AC.

Using the angle bisector theorem in terms of vectors, the ratio of the lengths of BA to AD is equal to the ratio of the projections onto AC.

Alternatively, using the formula for the angle bisector in coordinates.

But maybe it's easier to use the angle bisector theorem which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side in the","[0, '0)\n']",28,"[28, '28']",False
"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x - 1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), I'll start by squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots. This gives me \(\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \frac{9}{4}\).

Next, I'll cross-multiply to get rid of the fractions: \(8x = 9(3x - 1)\). Expanding the right side, I have \(8x = 27x - 9\).

Then, I'll move all terms involving \(x\) to one side by subtracting \(8x\) from both sides, resulting in \(0 = 19x - 9\). Adding 9 to both sides gives \(19x = 9\), and finally, dividing both sides by 19 yields \(x = \frac{9}{19}\).

"Okay, so I have this problem where four points A, B, C, and D are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. I need to find the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I should visualize the problem. Imagine a circle with four points on its circumference. These points are placed randomly, so their positions are not predetermined. The chords AB and CD will intersect if the points are arranged in a certain way. I think the key here is to determine the conditions under which two chords intersect.

I remember that two chords in a circle intersect if and only if the four endpoints are arranged alternately around the circle. That is, if we go around the circle, we encounter the points in the order A, C, B, D, or some rotation of this order. If the points are in such an order, the chords AB and CD will cross each other inside the circle. If they are not, the chords won't intersect.

So, the problem reduces to finding the probability that, when four points are placed randomly on a circle, they are arranged in an alternating order. Let me think about how to calculate this probability.

Since the points are chosen independently and uniformly on the circumference, the circle is symmetric, and the probability should not depend on where we place the first point. Maybe I can fix one point and consider the positions of the others relative to it. Let's fix point A at some position on the circle. Then, the positions of B, C, and D are random with respect to A.

But wait, actually, since the circle is continuous and symmetric, fixing one point doesn't affect the generality. So, let's fix point A at a specific position, say at angle 0 degrees. Then, the positions of B, C, and D can be represented by angles θ_B, θ_C, and θ_D, each uniformly distributed between 0 and 360 degrees (or 0 and 2π radians, whichever is more convenient).

However, dealing with angles might complicate things. Maybe it's better to think in terms of ordering. Since the points are placed randomly, the order in which they appear around the circle is random. So, after fixing point A, the other three points B, C, and D can be arranged in any order around the circle.

The total number of possible orderings of the three points B, C, D around the circle is 3! = 6. Each ordering is equally likely because the points are placed independently and uniformly. Now, out of these 6 orderings, how many result in the chords AB and CD intersecting?

Let me list all possible orderings:

1. A, B, C, D
2. A, B, D, C
3. A, C, B, D
4. A, C, D, B
5. A, D, B, C
6. A, D, C, B

Wait, actually, since we fixed A, the orderings are relative to A. So, the possible orderings of B, C, D around the circle are all permutations of B, C, D. There are 3! = 6 permutations.

Now, for each permutation, I need to check if chords AB and CD intersect. Let's recall that chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the points are interleaved, meaning that when going around the circle, we encounter A, then C, then B, then D, or A, D, B, C, or any rotation of this pattern.

Wait, actually, more precisely, the chords AB and CD intersect if the points are arranged in the order A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C when moving around the circle. Because in these cases, the chords cross each other inside the circle.

So, let's analyze each permutation:

1. A, B, C, D: Here, after A, we have B, then C, then D. So, the order is A, B, C, D. The chords AB and CD would not intersect because all points of AB come before all points of CD.

2. A, B, D, C: Similarly, after A, we have B, then D, then C. So, the order is A, B, D, C. Again, AB comes before CD, so chords don't intersect.

3. A, C, B, D: After A, we have C, then B, then D. So, the order is A, C, B, D. Here, AB and CD would intersect because C is between A and B, and D is after B. So, chords cross.

4. A, C, D, B: After A, we have C, then D, then B. So, the order is A, C, D, B. Here, AB and CD would not intersect because D is between C and B, but since D is before B, the chord CD is entirely on one side of AB.

Wait, actually, let me think again. If the order is A, C, D, B, then chord AB goes from A to B, and chord CD goes from C to D. Since C is after A, D is after C, and B is after D, the chord CD is entirely between A and B, so they don't intersect.

5. A, D, B, C: After A, we have D, then B, then C. So, the order is A, D, B, C. Here, chord AB goes from A to B, and chord CD goes from C to D. Since D is after A, B is after D, and C is after B, chord CD is from C to D, which is before A. Wait, no, C is after B, so chord CD would go from C (after B) to D (before A). So, does this chord intersect AB?

Wait, maybe I need a better way to visualize this. If the order is A, D, B, C, then moving clockwise from A, we have D, then B, then C. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is two steps away. Chord CD is from C to D, which is three steps away. Do they intersect?

Hmm, actually, in this case, chord CD would cross chord AB because C is after B and D is before A. So, chord CD would have to cross chord AB to connect C and D. So, in this case, they do intersect.

Wait, now I'm confused. Let me try to think differently. Maybe instead of trying to list all permutations, I can use a more systematic approach.

I remember that for four points on a circle, the probability that two specific chords intersect is 1/3. But I need to verify this.

Alternatively, another approach is to fix the position of point A, then consider the positions of B, C, D relative to A. Since the circle is continuous, we can fix A at a specific position without loss of generality.

Once A is fixed, the positions of B, C, D are random on the circumference. Let's consider the circle as a unit circle for simplicity.

Now, the key is to determine the order of the points B, C, D around the circle. Since they are placed randomly, each of the 3! = 6 orderings is equally likely.

Out of these 6 orderings, how many result in chords AB and CD intersecting?

As I thought earlier, chords AB and CD intersect if the points are interleaved, meaning that when going around the circle, we encounter A, then C, then B, then D, or A, D, B, C. These are the two cases where the chords cross.

Wait, but in the list of permutations, each permutation corresponds to the order of B, C, D after A. So, for example, if the order is C, B, D, that would correspond to A, C, B, D around the circle. Similarly, D, B, C would correspond to A, D, B, C.

So, in the 6 permutations of B, C, D, how many have C and D interleaved with B?

Wait, actually, for chords AB and CD to intersect, the points must alternate: A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C. So, in terms of the order of B, C, D, this would correspond to C and D being on either side of B.

Wait, no. Let me think again. If we fix A, then the order of B, C, D can be such that C and D are on opposite sides of B, which would cause the chords to intersect.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of circular permutations. Since the circle has no beginning or end, fixing A allows us to consider linear orderings of the remaining points.

So, fixing A, the other three points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. For each arrangement, we can check if AB and CD intersect.

Let me list all 6 permutations of B, C, D:

1. B, C, D: Order around the circle is A, B, C, D. Chords AB and CD do not intersect.

2. B, D, C: Order is A, B, D, C. Chords AB and CD do not intersect.

3. C, B, D: Order is A, C, B, D. Chords AB and CD intersect.

4. C, D, B: Order is A, C, D, B. Chords AB and CD do not intersect.

5. D, B, C: Order is A, D, B, C. Chords AB and CD intersect.

6. D, C, B: Order is A, D, C, B. Chords AB and CD do not intersect.

So, out of the 6 permutations, only two result in intersecting chords: permutations 3 and 5. Therefore, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, the probability is 1/3.

But let me think again to make sure I didn't miss anything. Another way to approach this is to consider that for four points on a circle, the number of ways to pair them into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each pairing is equally likely if the points are randomly placed.

Wait, actually, no. The pairings are not equally likely in terms of the chords intersecting. Wait, no, actually, the number of intersecting pairings is 1 out of the 3 possible pairings. Because only one of the three pairings results in intersecting chords.

Wait, that might be another way to think about it. If we have four points on a circle, the number of ways to connect them into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Out of these, only one pairing results in intersecting chords, which is AC-BD. So, the probability is 1/3.

But wait, in our problem, the chords are fixed as AB and CD. So, it's not about choosing the pairings, but rather, given that we have four points, what's the probability that AB and CD intersect.

Hmm, so maybe the two approaches are related. If we fix AB and CD, then the probability that they intersect is equal to the probability that the four points are arranged in an order where AB and CD cross each other, which is 1/3.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is to fix point A, then the positions of B, C, D are random. The chord AB divides the circle into two arcs. For chord CD to intersect AB, points C and D must lie on different arcs created by AB.

Wait, that might be another approach. Let me try that.

Fix point A. Then, point B is somewhere on the circle. The chord AB divides the circle into two arcs: the minor arc AB and the major arc AB (assuming AB is not a diameter, but since points are random, the probability of AB being a diameter is zero, so we can ignore that case).

Now, for chord CD to intersect AB, points C and D must lie on different arcs created by AB. That is, one of them is on the minor arc AB, and the other is on the major arc AB.

So, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is equal to the probability that one is on the minor arc and the other is on the major arc.

Since the circle is continuous, the length of the minor arc AB is some random value between 0 and π radians (assuming unit circle). But since the points are chosen uniformly, the probability can be calculated by integrating over all possible positions of B.

Wait, this might get complicated, but let's try.

Let’s denote the length of the minor arc AB as θ, where θ is between 0 and π. The probability density function for θ is (1/(2π)) * 2 = 1/π, because the angle between two random points on a circle has a distribution with density 1/π for θ between 0 and π.

Now, given θ, the probability that point C is on the minor arc AB is θ/(2π), and the probability that point D is on the major arc AB is (2π - θ)/(2π). Similarly, the probability that point C is on the major arc AB is (2π - θ)/(2π), and point D is on the minor arc AB is θ/(2π).

Therefore, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is 2 * [θ/(2π) * (2π - θ)/(2π)] = 2 * [θ(2π - θ)]/(4π²) = [θ(2π - θ)]/(2π²).

Now, to find the overall probability, we need to integrate this over all possible θ from 0 to π, weighted by the probability density of θ, which is 1/π.

So, the probability P is:

P = ∫₀^π [θ(2π - θ)/(2π²)] * (1/π) dθ

Simplify the integrand:

[θ(2π - θ)]/(2π²) * (1/π) = [θ(2π - θ)]/(2π³)

So,

P = ∫₀^π [θ(2π - θ)]/(2π³) dθ

Let’s compute this integral.

First, expand the numerator:

θ(2π - θ) = 2πθ - θ²

So,

P = ∫₀^π (2πθ - θ²)/(2π³) dθ = (1/(2π³)) ∫₀^π (2πθ - θ²) dθ

Compute the integral:

∫₀^π 2πθ dθ = 2π * [θ²/2]₀^π = 2π * (π²/2 - 0) = π³

∫₀^π θ² dθ = [θ³/3]₀^π = π³/3 - 0 = π³/3

So,

P = (1/(2π³)) (π³ - π³/3) = (1/(2π³)) (2π³/3) = (2","[0, '0']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There are two circles with the same center D. One has a radius of 1, and the other has a radius of 2. So, the bigger circle has radius 2, and the smaller one has radius 1. 

The problem says that the total area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. Hmm, okay. So, the shaded area is 5/12 times the area of the bigger circle. I need to find the measure of the smaller angle ADC. I think ADC is the angle at point D, between points A and C, which are probably points on the circles.

Wait, let me make sure. Since there are two circles, maybe points A and C are on the smaller and larger circles respectively? Or maybe both on the same circle? Hmm, the problem doesn't specify, but since it's talking about angle ADC, and D is the center, points A and C must be on the circumference of the circles. So, point A is on the smaller circle, and point C is on the larger circle. So, DA is 1, and DC is 2.

So, angle ADC is the angle between DA and DC, which are radii of the two circles. So, the angle at the center between these two points. The area of the shaded region is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to figure out what that shaded region is. Is it a sector, a segment, or something else?

Wait, the problem says ""celková plocha vyznačenej oblasti"" which translates to ""the total area of the shaded region."" So, maybe it's the area between the two circles, like a ring segment? Or perhaps a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle?

Let me think. If it's a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle, then the area would be (1/2)*r²θ - (1/2)*r²θ, but with different radii. So, for the larger circle, radius 2, area of sector is (1/2)*(2)²θ = 2θ. For the smaller circle, radius 1, area of sector is (1/2)*(1)²θ = 0.5θ. So, the area between them would be 2θ - 0.5θ = 1.5θ.

But the problem says the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is π*(2)² = 4π. So, 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

So, if the area between the two sectors is 1.5θ, and that equals (5/3)π, then 1.5θ = (5/3)π. Let me solve for θ.

1.5θ = (5/3)π

1.5 is 3/2, so:

(3/2)θ = (5/3)π

Multiply both sides by 2/3:

θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π radians.

Wait, but the question asks for the measure in degrees. So, I need to convert radians to degrees. Since π radians is 180 degrees, so (10/9)π radians is (10/9)*180 degrees.

Calculating that: 10/9 * 180 = (10*180)/9 = (1800)/9 = 200 degrees.

Wait, that seems a bit large. Let me double-check my steps.

First, the area of the larger circle is 4π. 5/12 of that is indeed (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

The area between the two sectors is 1.5θ, which is (3/2)θ. So, (3/2)θ = (5/3)π.

Solving for θ: θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π. That's correct.

Converting to degrees: (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees. Hmm, 200 degrees is more than a semicircle, which is 180 degrees. Is that possible?

Wait, maybe I misunderstood the shaded area. Maybe it's not the area between the two sectors, but just a segment or something else. Let me think again.

If the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a triangle or something. Wait, no, the problem says ""celková plocha vyznačenej oblasti,"" which is the total shaded area. It doesn't specify whether it's a sector or a segment. Maybe it's a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle, which is what I initially thought.

But 200 degrees seems quite large. Let me check the calculations again.

Area of the larger circle: π*(2)^2 = 4π.

5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

Area between the two sectors: (1/2)*(2)^2*θ - (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = (2θ) - (0.5θ) = 1.5θ.

Set equal to (5/3)π: 1.5θ = (5/3)π.

1.5 is 3/2, so (3/2)θ = (5/3)π.

Multiply both sides by 2/3: θ = (5/3)*(2/3)π = (10/9)π.

Convert to degrees: (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.

Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe 200 degrees is correct. Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is a segment, not a sector. Let me consider that.

If the shaded area is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, the area would be ( (1/2)*r²(θ - sinθ) ) for each circle, subtracted.

So, the area would be [ (1/2)*(2)^2*(θ - sinθ) ] - [ (1/2)*(1)^2*(θ - sinθ) ] = [2*(θ - sinθ)] - [0.5*(θ - sinθ)] = 1.5*(θ - sinθ).

Set that equal to (5/3)π.

So, 1.5*(θ - sinθ) = (5/3)π.

Hmm, that's a more complicated equation. Let me see if θ = 10/9 π satisfies this.

Compute 1.5*(10/9 π - sin(10/9 π)).

First, sin(10/9 π) is sin(200 degrees). Sin(200 degrees) is negative, since 200 degrees is in the third quadrant. Sin(200) = -sin(20) ≈ -0.3420.

So, 10/9 π ≈ 3.497 radians, which is 200 degrees.

So, 1.5*(3.497 - (-0.3420)) = 1.5*(3.497 + 0.3420) ≈ 1.5*(3.839) ≈ 5.7585.

But (5/3)π ≈ 5.2359.

So, 5.7585 is larger than 5.2359, so θ = 10/9 π is too big if we consider segments.

Therefore, maybe the shaded area is indeed the sector area, not the segment. So, 200 degrees is the answer.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is a sector of the smaller circle? But that would be smaller than the larger circle's sector.

Wait, the problem says ""celková plocha vyznačenej oblasti je 5/12 plochy väčšej kružnice."" So, the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, it's 5/12 of 4π, which is 5/3 π.

If the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle, then the area would be (1/2)*r²θ = (1/2)*4*θ = 2θ. So, 2θ = 5/3 π, so θ = (5/6)π, which is 150 degrees. But that's the angle for the larger circle's sector. But the problem is asking for angle ADC, which is the angle between DA and DC, so if the sector is 150 degrees, then angle ADC is 150 degrees.

Wait, but earlier I thought it was 200 degrees. Hmm, conflicting results.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is the area of the smaller circle's sector subtracted from the larger circle's sector. So, the area between the two sectors is 5/12 of the larger circle's area.

So, area between sectors = (1/2)*2²θ - (1/2)*1²θ = 2θ - 0.5θ = 1.5θ.

Set equal to 5/12 * 4π = 5/3 π.

So, 1.5θ = 5/3 π.

θ = (5/3 π) / 1.5 = (5/3 π) / (3/2) = (5/3)*(2/3) π = 10/9 π ≈ 3.497 radians ≈ 200 degrees.

So, that's consistent with my first calculation.

But if the shaded area is just a sector of the larger circle, then θ would be 150 degrees. But the problem says ""celková plocha vyznačenej oblasti,"" which might imply that it's the area between the two circles, i.e., the annular sector.

So, I think the correct approach is that the shaded area is the area between the two sectors, which is 1.5θ = 5/3 π, leading to θ = 10/9 π radians, which is 200 degrees.

But wait, 200 degrees is more than 180 degrees, which is a reflex angle. Is that possible? The problem says ""menšieho uhla,"" which means ""smaller angle."" So, if the angle is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would be 160 degrees, because the total around a point is 360 degrees, so 360 - 200 = 160 degrees.

Wait, that's a good point. The angle ADC could be the smaller angle or the larger angle, but since it's specified as the ""menšieho"" (smaller) angle, it must be the smaller one, which would be 160 degrees.

Wait, hold on. If θ is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle between DA and DC is 160 degrees, because 360 - 200 = 160. So, maybe the answer is 160 degrees.

But let me think again. The angle ADC is the angle between DA and DC. If the sector area between them is 200 degrees, then the angle is 200 degrees, but since it's a smaller angle, it's 160 degrees.

Wait, no. The angle between two radii is the smaller angle unless specified otherwise. So, if the sector is 200 degrees, the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle would be 160 degrees. So, perhaps the problem is referring to the smaller angle, which is 160 degrees.

But I'm confused now. Let me clarify.

In a circle, the angle between two radii can be measured in two ways: the smaller arc and the larger arc. The smaller angle is the one less than or equal to 180 degrees, and the larger angle is the one greater than 180 degrees. So, if the sector area corresponds to 200 degrees, then the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

But the problem says ""veľkosť (menšieho) uhla,"" which translates to ""the measure (smaller) angle."" So, it's specifically asking for the smaller angle, which would be 160 degrees.

Wait, but how does that affect the area? Because the area between the two sectors is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, which one is it?

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the area between the sectors is 200 degrees. Maybe the angle is 160 degrees, and the area between the sectors is 160 degrees, but that would give a smaller area.

Wait, let me recast the problem.

If the shaded area is the area between the two sectors, which is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, then:

Area between sectors = (1/2)*(2)^2*θ - (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = 2θ - 0.5θ = 1.5θ.

Set equal to 5/12 * 4π = 5/3 π.

So, 1.5θ = 5/3 π.

θ = (5/3 π) / 1.5 = (5/3 π) / (3/2) = (5/3)*(2/3) π = 10/9 π ≈ 3.497 radians ≈ 200 degrees.

So, θ is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, is the problem asking for the angle θ, which is 200 degrees, or the smaller angle, which is 160 degrees?

The problem says ""veľkosť (menšieho) uhla ADC,"" which is ""the measure (smaller) angle ADC."" So, it's specifically asking for the smaller angle, which would be 160 degrees.

But wait, if the sector area is 200 degrees, then the angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, is the shaded area corresponding to the 200 degrees sector, or the 160 degrees?

Wait, the area between the sectors is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, perhaps the shaded area is the smaller segment, which would correspond to 16","[160, '160']",120,"[120, '120']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem to evaluate the expression:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that involve the sine of sums and differences. Maybe I can use those to simplify the expression. Let me recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

So, if I let \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), then the expression becomes:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)
\]

Which, using the identities, would be:

\[
[\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B] \cdot [\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B]
\]

Wait, that looks like the product of a sum and difference, which is a difference of squares. So, this simplifies to:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Okay, so that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to compute this expression. Let me write that down:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

But I know that \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \). So, \( \sin A = 0.4 \) and \( \sin B = 0.5 \). I need to find \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \) to plug into the equation.

I remember that \( \cos(\arcsin x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Let me verify that. If \( \theta = \arcsin x \), then \( \sin \theta = x \), and \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) because \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \). So, yes, that's correct.

So, let's compute \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \):

For \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}
\]
Hmm, \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is approximately 0.9165, but maybe I can keep it exact for now.

For \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \):
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Okay, so \( \cos B \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, plugging back into the expression:

First, compute \( \sin A \cos B \):
\[
\sin A \cos B = 0.4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.2 \sqrt{3}
\]

Then, compute \( \cos A \sin B \):
\[
\cos A \sin B = \sqrt{0.84} \times 0.5 = 0.5 \sqrt{0.84}
\]

Wait, but \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is the same as \( \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Let me check that:

\( 21 \times 4 = 84 \), so \( \sqrt{84} = \sqrt{4 \times 21} = 2 \sqrt{21} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Yes, that's correct.

So, \( \cos A = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Therefore, \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \).

So, now, going back to the expression:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2
\]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 \)
\[
(0.2)^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12
\]

Second term: \( \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2 \)
\[
\frac{21}{100} = 0.21
\]

So, subtracting the second term from the first:

\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Wait, that gives me a negative number. Is that possible? Let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake.

Starting from the beginning:

We have \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \), which is equal to \( (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 \). That seems correct.

Then, \( \sin A = 0.4 \), \( \sin B = 0.5 \). Correct.

\( \cos A = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Correct.

\( \cos B = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Correct.

Then, \( \sin A \cos B = 0.4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.2 \sqrt{3} \). Correct.

\( \cos A \sin B = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \). Correct.

Squaring both:

\( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12 \). Correct.

\( \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2 = \frac{21}{100} = 0.21 \). Correct.

Subtracting: 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09. Hmm, negative. But sine functions can be negative, but in this case, the angles involved are arcsin of positive numbers, so they are in the first quadrant. So, \( A \) and \( B \) are both between 0 and \( \pi/2 \). Therefore, \( A + B \) is less than \( \pi \), and \( A - B \) could be positive or negative depending on which is larger.

Wait, \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately, let me compute that. \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is roughly, since \( \sin(\pi/6) = 0.5 \), so 0.4 is a bit less, maybe around 0.4115 radians. Similarly, \( \arcsin 0.5 = \pi/6 \approx 0.5236 radians. So, \( A \approx 0.4115 \), \( B \approx 0.5236 \). So, \( A - B \) is negative, approximately -0.1121 radians. So, \( \sin(A - B) \) is negative, but when we take the product, it's \( \sin(A + B) \times \sin(A - B) \). So, \( \sin(A + B) \) is positive because \( A + B \) is less than \( \pi \), and \( \sin(A - B) \) is negative because \( A - B \) is negative. So, the product is negative, which matches our result of -0.09.

But let me think if there's another way to compute this expression without going through all these steps, maybe using another identity.

Wait, I remember that \( \sin C \cdot \sin D \) can be expressed using the identity:

\[
\sin C \sin D = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(C - D) - \cos(C + D)]
\]

But in our case, it's \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \). Let me see if that can be expressed differently.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for \( \sin x \cdot \sin y \). Wait, but in this case, it's \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \). Let me see if I can find an identity for that.

Wait, actually, I think there's an identity that says:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Is that correct? Let me verify.

Using the identity:

\[
\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B) = (\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Which is the same as:

\[
\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]

Hmm, that's not exactly \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \). Wait, maybe I can factor this differently.

Let me factor:

\[
\sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B = \sin^2 A (1 - \sin^2 B) - (1 - \sin^2 A) \sin^2 B
\]
\[
= \sin^2 A - \sin^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 B + \sin^2 A \sin^2 B
\]
\[
= \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Oh, that's nice! So, indeed, \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \). That's a useful identity.

So, that simplifies things a lot. Instead of computing all those cosines and squaring, I can just compute \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \).

Given that \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), so \( \sin A = 0.4 \) and \( \sin B = 0.5 \). Therefore:

\[
\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = (0.4)^2 - (0.5)^2 = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09
\]

So, that's the same result as before, but with less computation. That's much simpler!

Therefore, the value of the expression is -0.09.

But wait, let me make sure that this identity is correct. I derived it quickly, but let me verify it with another method.

Let me take specific angles to test. Let’s say A = 30°, B = 45°.

Compute \( \sin(30° + 45°) \cdot \sin(30° - 45°) \).

First, \( \sin(75°) \cdot \sin(-15°) \).

\( \sin(75°) \approx 0.9659 \), \( \sin(-15°) \approx -0.2588 \).

So, the product is approximately 0.9659 * (-0.2588) ≈ -0.25.

Now, compute \( \sin^2 30° - \sin^2 45° \).

\( \sin^2 30° = 0.25 \), \( \sin^2 45° = 0.5 \).

So, 0.25 - 0.5 = -0.25. Which matches the previous result. So, the identity holds for this case.

Therefore, the identity \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \) is correct.

So, in our problem, since \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), we can directly compute \( \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B \) as \( (0.4)^2 - (0.5)^2 = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09 \).

Therefore, the value of the expression is -0.09.

But just to be thorough, let me compute it using the original approach as well, to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Earlier, I had:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2 = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Which is the same result. So, both methods give me the same answer, which is reassuring.

Therefore, I can confidently say that the value of the expression is -0.09.

But wait, the problem didn't specify whether to give an exact value or a decimal. Since 0.09 is 9/100, maybe I can express it as a fraction.

-0.09 is equal to -","[-0.0900000000000000, '-0.09']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify it.

First, I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum formulas, but with four terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that there are formulas for multiple angles or maybe something related to roots of unity. Let me think about that.

Wait, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15. I notice that each angle is double the previous one. 2π/15, then 4π/15 (which is 2*(2π/15)), then 8π/15 (which is 2*(4π/15)), and 16π/15 (which is 2*(8π/15)). So, each term is a double angle of the previous. That seems like a geometric progression in the angles, with a common ratio of 2.

I remember that when dealing with products of cosines with angles in geometric progression, especially with a ratio of 2, there might be a specific identity or formula that can help. Maybe something related to the sine of multiple angles?

Let me recall the identity for the product of cosines where each angle is double the previous one. I think it relates to the sine function. Specifically, I remember that the product cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) can be expressed in terms of sine functions. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

I think it's something like:

sin(2^n θ) = 2^n sinθ cosθ cos2θ cos4θ ... cos(2^{n-1}θ)

So, rearranging that, the product of the cosines would be sin(2^n θ) / (2^n sinθ). Let me check if that makes sense.

If I take n=1: sin(2θ) = 2 sinθ cosθ, so cosθ = sin(2θ)/(2 sinθ). That works.

For n=2: sin(4θ) = 4 sinθ cosθ cos2θ, so cosθ cos2θ = sin(4θ)/(4 sinθ). That also seems correct.

So, in general, the product of cosθ * cos2θ * cos4θ * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ).

In this problem, we have four terms: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), cos(16π/15). Let me see if this fits the pattern.

Let me denote θ = 2π/15. Then, the angles are θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ. So, n=4, since we have four terms. Then, according to the formula, the product should be sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ).

Let me compute 16θ: 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15. Hmm, 32π/15 is more than 2π, so maybe I can subtract 2π to find an equivalent angle. 32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, sin(16θ) = sin(2π/15).

So, the product becomes sin(2π/15)/(16 sinθ). But θ is 2π/15, so sinθ is sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the product is 1/16? Let me verify that.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the formula. The formula is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ)

So, in this case, n=4, so the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). As I calculated, 16θ = 32π/15, which is equivalent to 2π/15 because 32π/15 - 2π = 2π/15. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But wait, let me make sure that the formula applies here. The formula is for the product of cosθ, cos2θ, cos4θ, ..., cos(2^{n-1}θ). In our case, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15, which is exactly θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ where θ=2π/15. So, n=4, so the formula should apply.

Therefore, the product is indeed 1/16.

But wait, let me compute the product numerically to check. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Let me compute each cosine term:

cos(2π/15): 2π/15 is 24 degrees, so cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135

cos(4π/15): 4π/15 is 48 degrees, cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691

cos(8π/15): 8π/15 is 96 degrees, cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045

cos(16π/15): 16π/15 is 192 degrees, cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781

Now, multiply them all together:

0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118

0.6118 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639

-0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625

0.0625 is 1/16. So, that matches the earlier result.

Therefore, the product is indeed 1/16.

Wait, but in the formula, I had sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16, which is correct. So, that seems to confirm it.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity.

I know that cosθ can be expressed in terms of complex exponentials: cosθ = (e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}) / 2. So, maybe I can express each cosine term as such and multiply them together.

But that might get complicated with four terms. Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for multiple angles.

Wait, another thought: 15 is 3*5, so maybe the angles relate to the 15th roots of unity. The 15th roots of unity are e^{2πik/15} for k=0,1,...,14.

But I'm not sure if that directly helps here, but perhaps considering the product of certain roots.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for sin(5θ) or something like that, since 15 is a multiple of 5.

Wait, let me think about the formula again. The product of cosines with angles doubling each time is a known identity, and it's sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sinθ). So, in this case, n=4, θ=2π/15, so sin(16θ)=sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). So, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15))=1/16.

Therefore, the answer is 1/16.

But just to make sure, let me compute the product numerically again:

cos(2π/15) ≈ 0.9135

cos(4π/15) ≈ 0.6691

cos(8π/15) ≈ -0.1045

cos(16π/15) ≈ -0.9781

Multiplying them: 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118

0.6118 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639

-0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625, which is 1/16.

So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the simplified product is 1/16.

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, and the height AM is 11 units long. There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the triangle is symmetric about the altitude AM. So, point M is the midpoint of BC, and AM is perpendicular to BC. That means BM equals MC. Let me denote the length of BM as x, so BC is 2x. Then, the sides AB and AC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABM. So, AB = AC = sqrt(AM² + BM²) = sqrt(11² + x²) = sqrt(121 + x²).

Now, point D is on AM, and AD is 10 units. Since AM is 11, that means DM is 1 unit because 11 - 10 = 1. So, D is very close to M, just 1 unit away from it.

The key condition here is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.

Maybe I can use some trigonometric relationships or similar triangles. Let me think about triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C form triangle BDC, and I know some lengths related to D. Since D is on AM, which is the altitude, BD and CD can be expressed in terms of x and the coordinates of D.

Wait, maybe coordinate geometry could help here. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier. Let's place point A at (0, 11), M at (0, 0), so point D is at (0, 1). Then, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, points B and C will be symmetric about the y-axis. Let me denote point B as (-x, 0) and point C as (x, 0). So, BC is from (-x, 0) to (x, 0), making its length 2x.

Now, I can write the coordinates of all points:
- A: (0, 11)
- B: (-x, 0)
- C: (x, 0)
- M: (0, 0)
- D: (0, 1)

Now, I need to find angle BAC and angle BDC. Let's start with angle BAC. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, angle BAC is the vertex angle. The base angles at B and C are equal.

Using coordinates, I can compute vectors or use slopes to find angles. Alternatively, maybe using the Law of Cosines in triangle ABC.

In triangle ABC, sides AB and AC are equal, each is sqrt(11² + x²) as I found earlier. The base BC is 2x. So, using the Law of Cosines on angle BAC:

cos(θ) = (AB² + AC² - BC²) / (2 * AB * AC)

But since AB = AC, this simplifies to:

cos(θ) = (2 * AB² - BC²) / (2 * AB²)

Plugging in AB² = 121 + x² and BC² = (2x)² = 4x²:

cos(θ) = (2*(121 + x²) - 4x²) / (2*(121 + x²))
= (242 + 2x² - 4x²) / (242 + 2x²)
= (242 - 2x²) / (242 + 2x²)
= (121 - x²) / (121 + x²)

So, cos(θ) = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). That's angle BAC.

Now, angle BDC is 3θ. Let's find angle BDC. Points B, D, C are at (-x, 0), (0, 1), and (x, 0) respectively. So, triangle BDC has vertices at these points.

To find angle BDC, which is at point D, I can use the Law of Cosines in triangle BDC. First, I need the lengths of BD, DC, and BC.

Wait, BC is 2x, but in triangle BDC, the sides are BD, DC, and BC. Wait, no, triangle BDC has sides BD, DC, and BC? Wait, no, triangle BDC is formed by points B, D, C, so the sides are BD, DC, and BC. But BC is 2x, BD and DC can be calculated using the distance formula.

Let me compute BD and DC.

Point B is (-x, 0), D is (0, 1). So, BD is sqrt[(0 - (-x))² + (1 - 0)²] = sqrt(x² + 1).

Similarly, DC is sqrt[(x - 0)² + (0 - 1)²] = sqrt(x² + 1). So, BD = DC = sqrt(x² + 1). Interesting, so triangle BDC is also isosceles with BD = DC.

Therefore, in triangle BDC, sides BD = DC = sqrt(x² + 1), and BC = 2x. So, angle BDC is the vertex angle of this isosceles triangle.

Using the Law of Cosines on angle BDC:

cos(angle BDC) = (BD² + DC² - BC²) / (2 * BD * DC)

Since BD = DC, this simplifies to:

cos(angle BDC) = (2 * BD² - BC²) / (2 * BD²)

Plugging in BD² = x² + 1 and BC² = 4x²:

cos(angle BDC) = (2*(x² + 1) - 4x²) / (2*(x² + 1))
= (2x² + 2 - 4x²) / (2x² + 2)
= (-2x² + 2) / (2x² + 2)
= (-x² + 1) / (x² + 1)

So, cos(angle BDC) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

But angle BDC is given as 3θ, so:

cos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

But earlier, we found that cos(θ) = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²). So, we have:

cos(3θ) = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

Now, I need to relate cos(3θ) to cos(θ). There's a trigonometric identity for cos(3θ):

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

So, substituting cos(θ) from earlier:

cos(3θ) = 4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]

And this is equal to (1 - x²)/(1 + x²). So, we have the equation:

4[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)]³ - 3[(121 - x²)/(121 + x²)] = (1 - x²)/(1 + x²)

This looks complicated, but maybe we can let t = x² to simplify the equation.

Let me set t = x². Then, the equation becomes:

4[(121 - t)/(121 + t)]³ - 3[(121 - t)/(121 + t)] = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

Let me denote u = (121 - t)/(121 + t). Then, the equation becomes:

4u³ - 3u = (1 - t)/(1 + t)

But u = (121 - t)/(121 + t). Let me express (1 - t)/(1 + t) in terms of u.

Let me solve for t in terms of u:

u = (121 - t)/(121 + t)

Cross-multiplying:

u(121 + t) = 121 - t

121u + ut = 121 - t

Bring all terms to one side:

121u + ut + t - 121 = 0

Factor t:

121u - 121 + t(u + 1) = 0

t(u + 1) = 121(1 - u)

So, t = [121(1 - u)] / (u + 1)

Therefore, (1 - t)/(1 + t) can be expressed as:

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = [1 - t]/[1 + t] = [ (1 + t) - 2t ] / (1 + t) = 1 - [2t/(1 + t)]

But maybe it's better to substitute t from above.

Wait, let's compute (1 - t)/(1 + t):

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = [1 - t]/[1 + t] = [ (1 + t) - 2t ] / (1 + t) = 1 - [2t/(1 + t)]

But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, let's express (1 - t)/(1 + t) in terms of u.

From t = [121(1 - u)] / (u + 1), plug into (1 - t)/(1 + t):

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = [1 - [121(1 - u)/(u + 1)]] / [1 + [121(1 - u)/(u + 1)]]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: [ (u + 1) - 121(1 - u) ] / (u + 1) = [u + 1 - 121 + 121u] / (u + 1) = [122u - 120] / (u + 1)

Denominator: [ (u + 1) + 121(1 - u) ] / (u + 1) = [u + 1 + 121 - 121u] / (u + 1) = [ -120u + 122 ] / (u + 1)

So, (1 - t)/(1 + t) = [122u - 120]/[ -120u + 122 ] = [122u - 120]/[122 - 120u]

Therefore, our equation becomes:

4u³ - 3u = [122u - 120]/[122 - 120u]

Let me write this as:

4u³ - 3u = (122u - 120)/(122 - 120u)

Multiply both sides by (122 - 120u):

(4u³ - 3u)(122 - 120u) = 122u - 120

Let me expand the left side:

First, multiply 4u³ by (122 - 120u):

4u³ * 122 = 488u³

4u³ * (-120u) = -480u⁴

Then, multiply -3u by (122 - 120u):

-3u * 122 = -366u

-3u * (-120u) = 360u²

So, combining all terms:

488u³ - 480u⁴ - 366u + 360u²

So, left side is:

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - 366u

Set equal to right side:

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - 366u = 122u - 120

Bring all terms to left side:

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - 366u - 122u + 120 = 0

Combine like terms:

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - (366 + 122)u + 120 = 0

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - 488u + 120 = 0

Hmm, that's a quartic equation. Let me see if I can factor this or find rational roots.

First, let's factor out a common factor if possible. All coefficients are even except 488 and 488, which are divisible by 8? Let me check:

-480: divisible by 8
488: 488 / 8 = 61
360: 360 / 8 = 45
-488: -488 / 8 = -61
120: 120 / 8 = 15

So, factor out 8:

8*(-60u⁴ + 61u³ + 45u² - 61u + 15) = 0

So, the equation reduces to:

-60u⁴ + 61u³ + 45u² - 61u + 15 = 0

Let me write it as:

60u⁴ - 61u³ - 45u² + 61u - 15 = 0

Now, let's try rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 15 over factors of 60, so ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15, ±1/2, etc. Let me test u=1:

60(1)^4 -61(1)^3 -45(1)^2 +61(1) -15 = 60 -61 -45 +61 -15 = (60 -61) + (-45 +61) -15 = (-1) + (16) -15 = 0. Oh, u=1 is a","[1, '1']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",True

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the expression in the middle is x⁴ + 4x². That looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it easier. Let me try that.

So, if y = x², then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. Now, I have a quadratic inequality in y. I can split this into two separate inequalities:

1. -4 < y² + 4y
2. y² + 4y < 21

I'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions must be satisfied.

Starting with the first inequality: -4 < y² + 4y.

Let me rearrange this to bring all terms to one side: y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Wait, that's because I added 4 to both sides. So, y² + 4y + 4 > 0.

Hmm, y² + 4y + 4 is a perfect square. It factors to (y + 2)² > 0. So, (y + 2)² > 0. Since a square is always non-negative, this inequality holds for all real y except where it's equal to zero. So, y ≠ -2. But y = x², which is always non-negative, so y can't be -2 anyway. Therefore, the first inequality is always true for all real x. So, I don't need to worry about this part; it doesn't restrict the solution.

Now, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.

Again, I'll bring all terms to one side: y² + 4y - 21 < 0.

This is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, I need to find the roots of the quadratic equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.

Calculating the discriminant: b² - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100. That's a perfect square, so the roots will be rational.

So, y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2.

Calculating both roots:

1. y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3
2. y = (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7

So, the roots are y = 3 and y = -7. Since the quadratic opens upwards (a = 1 > 0), the inequality y² + 4y - 21 < 0 will hold between the roots. So, the solution is -7 < y < 3.

But remember, y = x², which is always non-negative. So, y cannot be less than 0. Therefore, the lower bound of -7 doesn't affect our solution because y is already ≥ 0. So, the relevant interval is 0 ≤ y < 3.

So, 0 ≤ y < 3 translates back to x² < 3. Therefore, x must satisfy -√3 < x < √3.

Wait, let me double-check that. If y = x² < 3, then x is between -√3 and √3. Yes, that makes sense.

But hold on, I should also consider the first inequality. Earlier, I concluded that the first inequality (-4 < y² + 4y) is always true for all real y because (y + 2)² > 0. So, the only restriction comes from the second inequality, which gives us x² < 3.

Therefore, the solution is all real numbers x such that x is between -√3 and √3.

But just to be thorough, let me test a value in this interval to make sure. Let's pick x = 0. Plugging into the original inequality: -4 < 0 + 0 < 21, which is true.

What about x = 1? x⁴ + 4x² = 1 + 4 = 5. So, -4 < 5 < 21, which is true.

What about x = √3? x⁴ + 4x² = ( (√3)^4 ) + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so x = √3 is not included. Similarly, x = -√3 would give the same result, so it's excluded.

What about x = 2? x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32. 32 is not less than 21, so x = 2 is not in the solution set, which aligns with our interval.

What about x = -2? Same result, 32, which is outside the upper bound.

What about a number between √3 and 2, say x = 1.8? Let's compute x² = 3.24, so x⁴ = (3.24)^2 = 10.4976. Then x⁴ + 4x² = 10.4976 + 12.96 = 23.4576, which is greater than 21, so it's excluded. So, our interval is correct.

What about a number less than -√3, say x = -2? As before, it gives 32, which is too big.

What about a number between -√3 and √3, say x = 1.5? x² = 2.25, x⁴ = 5.0625. So, x⁴ + 4x² = 5.0625 + 9 = 14.0625, which is between -4 and 21, so it's included.

Wait, but the original inequality is -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. So, x⁴ + 4x² is always non-negative because x⁴ and x² are non-negative, and adding them with positive coefficients. So, the left side of the inequality, -4 < x⁴ + 4x², is always true because x⁴ + 4x² ≥ 0 > -4. So, actually, the first inequality doesn't impose any restrictions because x⁴ + 4x² is always greater than or equal to 0, which is greater than -4. So, the only restriction is from the upper bound, x⁴ + 4x² < 21, which gives us x² < 3, so x ∈ (-√3, √3).

Therefore, the solution is all real numbers x such that x is between -√3 and √3, not including the endpoints.

So, in interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:

1. Substitute y = x², leading to -4 < y² + 4y < 21.
2. The left inequality simplifies to (y + 2)² > 0, which is always true for real y.
3. The right inequality becomes y² + 4y - 21 < 0, which solves to -7 < y < 3.
4. Since y = x² ≥ 0, we have 0 ≤ y < 3, so x² < 3.
5. Therefore, x ∈ (-√3, √3).

Yes, that seems correct. I don't think I made any mistakes in the steps. The key was recognizing the substitution and then solving the quadratic inequality correctly. Also, remembering that y can't be negative because it's x squared was important to adjust the interval correctly.

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, consider the left part of the inequality:
\[
-4 < y^2 + 4y
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0
\]
This factors to:
\[
(y + 2)^2 > 0
\]
Since a square is always non-negative, this inequality holds for all real \(y\) except \(y = -2\). However, since \(y = x^2\) is always non-negative, this part is always true.

Next, consider the right part of the inequality:
\[
y^2 + 4y < 21
\]
Rearranging gives:
\[
y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]
This gives the roots:
\[
y = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = -7
\]
The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) holds between the roots, so:
\[
-7 < y < 3
\]
Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, we have:
\[
0 \leq y < 3
\]
This translates back to \(x\) as:
\[
x^2 < 3
\]
Thus, \(x\) must satisfy:
\[
-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

The solution in interval notation is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write them down again to make sure I have everything:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, I need to find \( xy + yz + zx \). I remember that in problems involving symmetric sums, sometimes it's helpful to use identities or known formulas. Let me think about what I know.

First, I recall that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Maybe that could be useful here since I have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) and \( xyz \) given.

Let me compute \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \). Plugging in the known values:

\( 4 - 3 \times 4 = 4 - 12 = -8 \).

So, \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \).

Hmm, that's one equation, but I don't know \( x + y + z \) or \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). Maybe I can find another relation.

Looking at the third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). That looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of symmetric sums.

Let me see, \( xy^2 + x^2 y \) can be written as \( xy(y + x) \), similarly for the other terms. So, the entire expression becomes:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \).

Hmm, that's interesting. Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). These are the standard symmetric sums.

So, let's rewrite the third equation in terms of \( S \) and \( P \). Each term like \( xy(x + y) \) can be expressed as \( xy(S - z) \) because \( x + y = S - z \). Similarly, \( xz(x + z) = xz(S - y) \) and \( yz(y + z) = yz(S - x) \).

So, substituting, the third equation becomes:

\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) = 12 \).

Let me expand each term:

1. \( xy(S - z) = xyS - xyz \)
2. \( xz(S - y) = xzS - xyz \)
3. \( yz(S - x) = yzS - xyz \)

Adding them all together:

\( (xyS + xzS + yzS) - 3xyz = 12 \).

Factor out \( S \) from the first part:

\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \).

But \( xy + xz + yz = P \) and \( xyz = 4 \), so substituting:

\( S \times P - 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

Simplify:

\( SP - 12 = 12 \).

So, \( SP = 24 \).

Alright, so now I have \( SP = 24 \). That's one equation involving \( S \) and \( P \).

Earlier, I had another equation from the identity:

\( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \).

Which is \( S(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - P) = -8 \).

I need another relation involving \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \). I remember that \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) \), which is \( S^2 - 2P \).

So, substituting back into the equation:

\( S(S^2 - 2P - P) = -8 \).

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \).

So, \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \).

But from earlier, I know that \( SP = 24 \). So, substituting \( SP = 24 \):

\( S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8 \).

Simplify:

\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \).

So, \( S^3 = 64 \).

Therefore, \( S = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \).

Now that I have \( S = 4 \), and since \( SP = 24 \), I can find \( P \):

\( 4 \times P = 24 \) => \( P = 6 \).

So, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I used the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \) correctly, which gave me \( S(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - P) = -8 \).
2. Then, I expressed \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) in terms of \( S \) and \( P \), which is correct.
3. Substituted back and got \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \).
4. Since \( SP = 24 \), substituted that in and solved for \( S \), getting \( S = 4 \).
5. Then, found \( P = 6 \).

Seems solid. Let me just verify if these values make sense with the original equations.

If \( S = 4 \), \( P = 6 \), and \( Q = 4 \), then let's see:

- \( x + y + z = 4 \)
- \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \)
- \( xyz = 4 \)

These are the elementary symmetric sums. So, the monic cubic polynomial with roots \( x, y, z \) is \( t^3 - 4t^2 + 6t - 4 = 0 \).

Let me factor this polynomial to see if it has real roots or something.

Trying \( t = 1 \): \( 1 - 4 + 6 - 4 = -1 \neq 0 \).

Trying \( t = 2 \): \( 8 - 16 + 12 - 4 = 0 \). So, \( t = 2 \) is a root.

So, factor out \( (t - 2) \):

Using polynomial division or synthetic division:

Divide \( t^3 - 4t^2 + 6t - 4 \) by \( t - 2 \).

Coefficients: 1 | -4 | 6 | -4

Bring down 1.

Multiply by 2: 1*2=2. Add to -4: -2.

Multiply by 2: -2*2=-4. Add to 6: 2.

Multiply by 2: 2*2=4. Add to -4: 0.

So, the polynomial factors as \( (t - 2)(t^2 - 2t + 2) \).

The quadratic \( t^2 - 2t + 2 \) has discriminant \( 4 - 8 = -4 \), so the other roots are complex: \( 1 \pm i \).

So, the roots are \( 2 \), \( 1 + i \), and \( 1 - i \).

Let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

First, \( xyz = 2 \times (1 + i) \times (1 - i) \).

Compute \( (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 - (-1) = 2 \).

So, \( xyz = 2 \times 2 = 4 \). That's correct.

Next, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \).

Compute each cube:

- \( 2^3 = 8 \)
- \( (1 + i)^3 \). Let's compute that:

\( (1 + i)^3 = (1 + i)(1 + i)(1 + i) \).

First, compute \( (1 + i)^2 = 1 + 2i + i^2 = 1 + 2i -1 = 2i \).

Then, multiply by \( (1 + i) \): \( 2i(1 + i) = 2i + 2i^2 = 2i - 2 = -2 + 2i \).

Similarly, \( (1 - i)^3 = -2 - 2i \).

So, adding all three cubes:

\( 8 + (-2 + 2i) + (-2 - 2i) = 8 - 2 - 2 + 2i - 2i = 4 \). That's correct.

Lastly, the third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \).

Let me compute each term:

First, let me denote \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 + i \), \( z = 1 - i \).

Compute \( xy^2 \):

\( x = 2 \), \( y^2 = (1 + i)^2 = 2i \). So, \( xy^2 = 2 \times 2i = 4i \).

Compute \( x^2 y \):

\( x^2 = 4 \), \( y = 1 + i \). So, \( x^2 y = 4(1 + i) = 4 + 4i \).

Compute \( xz^2 \):

\( z^2 = (1 - i)^2 = 1 - 2i + i^2 = 1 - 2i -1 = -2i \). So, \( xz^2 = 2 \times (-2i) = -4i \).

Compute \( x^2 z \):

\( x^2 = 4 \), \( z = 1 - i \). So, \( x^2 z = 4(1 - i) = 4 - 4i \).

Compute \( yz^2 \):

\( y = 1 + i \), \( z^2 = -2i \). So, \( yz^2 = (1 + i)(-2i) = -2i - 2i^2 = -2i + 2 = 2 - 2i \).

Compute \( y^2 z \):

\( y^2 = 2i \), \( z = 1 - i \). So, \( y^2 z = 2i(1 - i) = 2i - 2i^2 = 2i + 2 = 2 + 2i \).

Now, add all these terms together:

1. \( 4i \)
2. \( 4 + 4i \)
3. \( -4i \)
4. \( 4 - 4i \)
5. \( 2 - 2i \)
6. \( 2 + 2i \)

Let me add them step by step:

Start with 0.

Add \( 4i \): total is \( 4i \).

Add \( 4 + 4i \): total is \( 4 + 8i \).

Add \( -4i \): total is \( 4 + 4i \).

Add \( 4 - 4i \): total is \( 8 \).

Add \( 2 - 2i \): total is \( 10 - 2i \).

Add \( 2 + 2i \): total is \( 12 \).

Perfect, that's 12. So, all the equations are satisfied with \( S = 4 \), \( P = 6 \), and \( Q = 4 \).

Therefore, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is indeed 6.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is \boxed{6}.

3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 4 - 3 \times 4 = -8 \]
Thus,
\[ (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \]

Next, we rewrite the third equation in terms of symmetric sums. Let \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). The third equation becomes:
\[ xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \]
This can be expressed as:
\[ S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12 \]
Substituting \( P \) and \( Q \):
\[ S \times P - 12 = 12 \]
Thus,
\[ SP = 24 \]

We also know:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \]
Substituting back into the identity:
\[ S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \]
Since \( SP = 24 \), we substitute \( P = \frac{24}{S} \):
\[ S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8 \]
\[ S^3 - 72 = -8 \]

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions, I need to consider the critical points where the expression can change its sign. Also, I should note where the denominator is zero because the expression is undefined there.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

I know that the absolute value in the numerator, \(|x^2 - 81|\), is always non-negative because absolute values can't be negative. So, the numerator is either zero or positive. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which is a quadratic expression. I should factor that to find its roots.

Let me factor the denominator:

\(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\)

So, the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are the points where the expression is undefined, so I need to exclude them from the solution set.

Now, the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\). Let me factor that as well:

\(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). Therefore, the numerator is \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, as I thought earlier.

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Since the numerator is always non-negative, the sign of the entire expression depends on the denominator. The inequality is less than zero, so the expression must be negative. That means the denominator must be negative because the numerator is non-negative.

Therefore, the inequality reduces to finding where the denominator is negative:

\(x(x - 36) < 0\)

To solve this inequality, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These divide the real number line into three intervals:

1. \(x < 0\)
2. \(0 < x < 36\)
3. \(x > 36\)

I'll test each interval to see where the product \(x(x - 36)\) is negative.

1. For \(x < 0\), let's pick \(x = -1\):
   \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive. So, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

2. For \(0 < x < 36\), let's pick \(x = 1\):
   \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative. So, this interval satisfies the inequality.

3. For \(x > 36\), let's pick \(x = 37\):
   \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive. So, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the denominator is negative only when \(0 < x < 36\). But wait, I also need to consider the numerator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), so when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). At these points, the entire expression is zero, but the inequality is strict (less than zero, not less than or equal to). So, these points are excluded from the solution.

So, I need to exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the interval \(0 < x < 36\). But wait, \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), so only \(x = 9\) is within that interval. Therefore, I need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the solution.

Putting it all together, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 0, 36, and 9. So, in interval notation, that would be:

\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)
\]

But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The numerator is always non-negative, so the expression can only be negative if the denominator is negative. We found that the denominator is negative between 0 and 36. However, at \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the entire expression zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, yes, we have to exclude 9.

Also, I should check if there are any other points where the numerator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but as I mentioned, \(x = -9\) is not in the interval where the denominator is negative, so it doesn't affect the solution.

Therefore, the solution set is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

Wait, hold on. Let me think again. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). But in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), the only point where the numerator is zero is at \(x = 9\). So, in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), the expression is negative except at \(x = 9\), where it's zero. So, the solution is indeed \(0 < x < 9\) and \(9 < x < 36\).

But just to be thorough, let me test a value in each sub-interval to make sure.

1. In \(0 < x < 9\), let's pick \(x = 1\):
   Numerator: \(|1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   Denominator: \(1 - 36 = -35\), which is negative.
   So, the expression is positive divided by negative, which is negative. So, it satisfies the inequality.

2. In \(9 < x < 36\), let's pick \(x = 10\):
   Numerator: \(|100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   Denominator: \(100 - 360 = -260\), which is negative.
   So, the expression is positive divided by negative, which is negative. So, it satisfies the inequality.

3. At \(x = 9\), the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.

4. At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the expression is undefined.

So, everything checks out. Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

But wait, I just thought of something. The numerator is an absolute value, so it's always non-negative, but does that affect the intervals where the expression is negative? Let me think. Since the numerator is non-negative, the sign of the entire expression is determined solely by the denominator. So, as long as the denominator is negative, the expression is negative, except when the numerator is zero, which makes the expression zero. So, yes, my previous conclusion is correct.

Therefore, the solution is \(x\) in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).
</think>

To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we start by factoring both the numerator and the denominator.

The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which factors into \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which factors into \(x(x - 36)\).

The expression becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Since the numerator is an absolute value, it is always non-negative. Therefore, the sign of the entire expression depends on the denominator. The inequality is less than zero, so the denominator must be negative.

We solve the inequality \(x(x - 36) < 0\). The critical points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Using a sign chart, we determine the intervals where the product is negative:
- For \(x < 0\), the product is positive.
- For \(0 < x < 36\), the product is negative.
- For \(x > 36\), the product is positive.

Thus, the denominator is negative in the interval \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only exclude \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution is the interval \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\), which gives us:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)
\]

The final answer is:

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular field that's enclosed within an athletic track. The track consists of two sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters, and I need to find the maximum possible area of the field in square meters. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me try to understand the structure. The field is a rectangle, and the track goes around it, using the two longer sides of the rectangle and then connecting them with two semicircular ends. So, if I imagine looking down at the track from above, it's like a rectangle with semicircles on each end, forming a sort of oval shape.

Let me denote the length of the rectangle as 'l' and the width as 'w'. The two semicircular ends would each have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, right? So, the radius of each semicircle would be w/2.

Now, the total length of the track is given as 400 meters. The track consists of two straight sides (the lengths of the rectangle) and the circumference of the two semicircles. Since each semicircle has a circumference of πr, where r is the radius, two semicircles would make a full circle, so their combined circumference is 2πr. But wait, actually, each semicircle is half a circle, so two semicircles make a full circle. So, the total length contributed by the semicircular parts is πd, where d is the diameter, which is equal to the width w. So, that would be πw.

Therefore, the total length of the track is the sum of the two lengths of the rectangle and the circumference of the two semicircles. So, mathematically, that would be:

Total length = 2l + πw = 400 meters.

So, I can write that as:

2l + πw = 400.

Now, I need to find the maximum area of the rectangle. The area A of the rectangle is given by:

A = l * w.

So, I need to maximize A = l * w, given the constraint 2l + πw = 400.

This sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember that in calculus, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or substitution to solve such problems. Since this seems straightforward, maybe substitution is easier here.

Let me solve the constraint equation for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for l:

2l = 400 - πw

So,

l = (400 - πw)/2

Simplify that:

l = 200 - (πw)/2

Now, substitute this expression for l into the area formula:

A = l * w = [200 - (πw)/2] * w

Let me expand that:

A = 200w - (πw²)/2

So, now I have the area expressed solely in terms of w:

A(w) = 200w - (π/2)w²

Now, to find the maximum area, I need to find the value of w that maximizes A(w). Since this is a quadratic function in terms of w, and the coefficient of w² is negative (-π/2), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

The general form of a quadratic function is f(w) = aw² + bw + c, and the vertex occurs at w = -b/(2a). In this case, a = -π/2 and b = 200.

So, plugging into the vertex formula:

w = -b/(2a) = -200 / (2*(-π/2)) = -200 / (-π) = 200/π

So, the width w that maximizes the area is 200/π meters.

Now, let's find the corresponding length l using the earlier expression:

l = 200 - (πw)/2

Substitute w = 200/π:

l = 200 - (π*(200/π))/2 = 200 - (200)/2 = 200 - 100 = 100 meters.

So, the length l is 100 meters when the width w is 200/π meters.

Now, let's compute the maximum area A:

A = l * w = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π square meters.

Wait, let me double-check that. If l is 100 and w is 200/π, then yes, 100*(200/π) is 20000/π. That seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution:

We had 2l + πw = 400.

If l = 100 and w = 200/π, then:

2*100 + π*(200/π) = 200 + 200 = 400, which matches the given total length. So that checks out.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

Wait, but let me think again. The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. So, the total length is 2l + 2*(πr), where r is the radius of the semicircles. Since the diameter is w, the radius is w/2, so each semicircle is π*(w/2). Two semicircles would be 2*(π*(w/2)) = πw. So, yes, that's correct. So, the total length is 2l + πw = 400.

So, my earlier calculations are correct.

Alternatively, I can use calculus to find the maximum. Let's take the derivative of A(w) with respect to w and set it to zero.

A(w) = 200w - (π/2)w²

dA/dw = 200 - πw

Set dA/dw = 0:

200 - πw = 0

πw = 200

w = 200/π

Which is the same result as before. So, that confirms it.

Then, the second derivative test: d²A/dw² = -π, which is negative, confirming that it's a maximum.

So, the maximum area is indeed 20000/π square meters.

Wait, but let me compute that numerically to get a sense of the value. π is approximately 3.1416, so 20000/3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. But since the problem asks for the answer in terms of π, I should leave it as 20000/π.

Alternatively, sometimes problems prefer expressing it as (20000/π) m², but maybe simplifying it further. Let me see:

20000/π can be written as (20000/π) m², which is fine.

Wait, but let me check if I made any mistake in the initial setup. The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. So, the total length is 2l + 2*(πr), where r is the radius. Since the diameter is w, r = w/2, so each semicircle is π*(w/2). Two semicircles make πw. So, yes, 2l + πw = 400.

So, the setup is correct.

Another way to think about it: if the track were a full circle, the circumference would be 2πr, but here it's two semicircles, which together make a full circle, so the total length contributed by the curves is πw, as I had.

So, I think my approach is correct.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

**Final Answer**
The maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.
</think>

The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field enclosed within an athletic track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

First, we denote the length of the rectangle as \( l \) and the width as \( w \). The two semicircular ends each have a diameter equal to the width \( w \), so the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The total length of the track is given by the sum of the two straight sides and the circumference of the two semicircles. This can be expressed as:
\[ 2l + \pi w = 400 \]

We aim to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = l \times w \]

From the constraint equation, we solve for \( l \):
\[ 2l = 400 - \pi w \]
\[ l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( l \) into the area formula:
\[ A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w \]
\[ A = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0 \]
\[ \pi w = 200 \]
\[ w = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[ l = 200 - \frac{\pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} \]
\[ l = 200 - 100 \]
\[ l = 100 \]

The maximum area is then:
\[ A = l \times w = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the field is:

"Okay, so I have this triangle RST, and it's a right triangle because there's a right angle at S. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, RS is the vertical side, ST is the horizontal side, and RT is the hypotenuse. The length of RT is given as 5. 

The problem says that sin R is 2/5, and I need to find sin T. Hmm, let me recall some trigonometry basics. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, sin R = opposite side / hypotenuse. 

Looking at the triangle, angle R is at point R, which is the top vertex. The sides opposite and adjacent to angle R would be ST and RS, respectively. Wait, no, actually, in triangle RST, angle R is at point R, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle R would be ST and RS. But wait, let me make sure.

In triangle RST, the right angle is at S, so the sides are RS, ST, and RT. RS is the vertical side from S to R, which is sqrt(21) units long because R is at (2, sqrt(21)) and S is at (2,0). ST is the horizontal side from S to T, which is 2 units long because T is at (0,0) and S is at (2,0). RT is the hypotenuse, which is given as 5 units.

So, angle R is at point R, which is the top of the triangle. The sides adjacent to angle R are RS and RT, but wait, no. In a triangle, each angle has an opposite side and two adjacent sides. For angle R, the opposite side is ST, and the adjacent sides are RS and RT? Wait, no, RT is the hypotenuse, so maybe I need to think differently.

Wait, perhaps it's better to label the sides properly. Let me denote the sides as follows: side opposite angle R is ST, which is 2 units. The hypotenuse is RT, which is 5 units. So, sin R = opposite / hypotenuse = ST / RT = 2 / 5. That matches the given information, so that's correct.

Now, I need to find sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is the right angle? Wait, no, the right angle is at S. So, angle T is at point T, which is the other non-right angle. So, in triangle RST, the angles are at R, S, and T, with S being the right angle. So, angles R and T are the other two angles, both acute.

So, to find sin T, I need to figure out the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse for angle T. For angle T, the opposite side is RS, and the hypotenuse is RT. So, sin T = RS / RT.

I know RT is 5, but I need to find RS. Wait, RS is the vertical side from S to R, which is sqrt(21). Let me verify that. Since S is at (2,0) and R is at (2, sqrt(21)), the distance between them is sqrt[(2-2)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2] = sqrt[0 + 21] = sqrt(21). So, RS is sqrt(21).

Therefore, sin T = RS / RT = sqrt(21) / 5. But wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up the sides. For angle T, the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So yes, sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find RS if I didn't know it. Since RT is 5 and ST is 2, then RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2. So, RS^2 + 2^2 = 5^2 => RS^2 + 4 = 25 => RS^2 = 21 => RS = sqrt(21). So that confirms it.

Therefore, sin T is sqrt(21)/5. I think that's the answer. Let me just recap: in a right triangle, sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse. For angle R, opposite side is ST=2, hypotenuse RT=5, so sin R=2/5. For angle T, opposite side is RS=sqrt(21), hypotenuse RT=5, so sin T=sqrt(21)/5.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The coordinates given in the Asymptote code also support this because RS is vertical with length sqrt(21), ST is horizontal with length 2, and RT is the hypotenuse with length 5. So everything checks out.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.
</think>

In the right triangle \( \triangle RST \) with a right angle at \( S \), we are given that \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \). We need to find \( \sin{T} \).

First, we identify the sides of the triangle. The hypotenuse \( RT \) is given as 5 units. The side opposite angle \( R \) is \( ST \), which is 2 units. Using the definition of sine, we have:
\[ \sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5} \]

Next, we need to find \( \sin{T} \). The side opposite angle \( T \) is \( RS \). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we calculate the length of \( RS \):
\[ RS^2 + ST^2 = RT^2 \]
\[ RS^2 + 2^2 = 5^2 \]
\[ RS^2 + 4 = 25 \]
\[ RS^2 = 21 \]
\[ RS = \sqrt{21} \]

Now, using the definition of sine for angle \( T \):
\[ \sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The answer should be expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one.

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the distance from a point to another point is given by the distance formula. Since we're dealing with the origin, which is the point (0,0), and another point (x, y) on the graph, the distance squared between them would be \( x^2 + y^2 \). To find the minimum distance, I can minimize this distance squared because the square root function is monotonically increasing. So, minimizing \( x^2 + y^2 \) will also minimize the distance.

\( D^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \)

Simplifying this, I get:

\( D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

Okay, so now I have \( D^2 \) in terms of x. To find the minimum, I can take the derivative of \( D^2 \) with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. That should give me the critical points, which could be minima or maxima. Then I can check to make sure it's a minimum.

Let me compute the derivative. Let's denote \( f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \). Then,

\( f'(x) = 2x + \frac{1}{2} \times 2(x^2 - 3) \times 2x \)

Wait, let me make sure I do that correctly. The derivative of \( x^2 \) is 2x. For the second term, \( \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \), the derivative is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2(x^2 - 3) \times 2x \). Wait, no, hold on. The chain rule says derivative of the outer function times derivative of the inner function. So, the outer function is \( \frac{1}{2}u^2 \) where \( u = x^2 - 3 \). The derivative of that is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2u \times u' \), which is \( u \times u' \). So, \( u = x^2 - 3 \), so \( u' = 2x \). Therefore, the derivative of the second term is \( (x^2 - 3) \times 2x \). So, putting it all together:

\( f'(x) = 2x + (x^2 - 3)(2x) \)

Simplify that:

\( f'(x) = 2x + 2x(x^2 - 3) \)

Factor out 2x:

\( f'(x) = 2x[1 + (x^2 - 3)] \)

Simplify inside the brackets:

\( 1 + x^2 - 3 = x^2 - 2 \)

So, \( f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \)

To find critical points, set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \)

So, either \( 2x = 0 \) or \( x^2 - 2 = 0 \).

Solving these:

1. \( 2x = 0 \) gives \( x = 0 \)
2. \( x^2 - 2 = 0 \) gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)

So, the critical points are at \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Now, I need to determine which of these gives a minimum distance. Let's evaluate \( f(x) \) at each critical point.

First, at \( x = 0 \):

\( f(0) = 0^2 + \frac{1}{2}(0^2 - 3)^2 = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(9) = \frac{9}{2} \)

So, \( D^2 = \frac{9}{2} \), which means \( D = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \) or \( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Next, at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

Compute \( f(\sqrt{2}) \):

First, \( x^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \)

So, \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

Then, \( D^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \)

So, \( D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \)

Similarly, at \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

Since the function is even in x (because y depends on x squared), the distance squared will be the same as at \( x = \sqrt{2} \). So, \( D^2 = \frac{5}{2} \) as well.

So, comparing the distances squared:

- At \( x = 0 \): \( \frac{9}{2} \)
- At \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \): \( \frac{5}{2} \)

Since \( \frac{5}{2} < \frac{9}{2} \), the minimum distance occurs at \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \), and the minimal distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \).

But the problem asks for the distance expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \). Let me write \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \) as \( \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \). To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\( \frac{\sqrt{5} \times \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \)

So, the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{10}/2 \). Therefore, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Now, check if \( a \) is square-free. 10 factors into 2 and 5, both primes, so it's square-free. So, \( a = 10 \), \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \).

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because I might have made a mistake.

Wait, when I computed \( f(\sqrt{2}) \), I got \( D^2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2 \). So, \( D = \sqrt{5/2} \). But when I rationalize, that's \( \sqrt{10}/2 \). So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem using calculus with the distance formula directly, instead of minimizing the square of the distance. Let me try that to confirm.

The distance from the origin to a point (x, y) is \( D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), substitute:

\( D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 } \)

Which is the same as before, so squaring both sides gives the same expression. So, taking the derivative of D with respect to x would involve the chain rule, but since D is a positive function, minimizing D is equivalent to minimizing D squared, which is what I did earlier. So, the critical points are the same.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the formula for the distance from a point to a curve. I remember that the minimal distance occurs when the line connecting the origin to the point on the curve is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point.

So, let's try that approach. The slope of the tangent to the curve at point (x, y) is given by the derivative of y with respect to x.

Given \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), the derivative is:

\( dy/dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \times 2x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}x \)

So, the slope of the tangent line at (x, y) is \( \sqrt{2}x \).

The slope of the line connecting the origin (0,0) to the point (x, y) is \( m = y/x \). Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), this slope is:

\( m = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)}{x} = \frac{x^2 - 3}{\sqrt{2}x} \)

For the two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be -1. So,

\( \sqrt{2}x \times \frac{x^2 - 3}{\sqrt{2}x} = -1 \)

Simplify:

The \( \sqrt{2} \) cancels out, and x cancels with x (assuming x ≠ 0, which we can check later):

\( (x^2 - 3) = -1 \)

So,

\( x^2 - 3 = -1 \)

\( x^2 = 2 \)

\( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)

Which are the same critical points as before. So, this confirms that the minimal distance occurs at these x-values.

Therefore, plugging back into y:

\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

So, the point is \( (\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2}) \) or \( (-\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2}) \). The distance from the origin is:

\( \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 1/2} = \sqrt{5/2} = \sqrt{10}/2 \)

So, same result as before. Therefore, the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{10}/2 \), so \( a = 10 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( a + b = 12 \).

Wait, but just to make sure, let me check if there's any other critical points or if I missed something. The function is a parabola opening upwards, so it's symmetric about the y-axis. The origin is below the vertex of the parabola, which is at (0, -3/√2). So, the minimal distance should be somewhere on the sides, which is what we found at \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \).

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers, but that might be overcomplicating. But just for thoroughness, let's try.

We want to minimize \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \) subject to the constraint \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \).

Set up the Lagrangian:

\( \mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = x^2 + y^2 - \lambda \left( y - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right) \)

Take partial derivatives:

1. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 2x - \lambda \left( - \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 2y - \lambda = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = - \left( y - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right) = 0 \)

From equation 3, we have the original constraint:

\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \)

From equation 2:

\( 2y = \lambda \) => \( \lambda = 2y \)

From equation 1:

\( 2x - \lambda \left( - \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 0 \)

Substitute \( \lambda = 2y \):

\( 2x - 2y \left( - \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 0 \)

Simplify:

\( 2x + \frac{4xy}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \)

Factor out 2x:

\( 2x \left( 1 + \frac{2y}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 0 \)

So, either \( x = 0 \) or \( 1 + \frac{2y}{\sqrt{2}} = 0 \)

Case 1: \( x = 0 \)

From the constraint, \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0 - 3) = -3/\sqrt{2} \). So, the point is (0, -3/√2). The distance squared is \( 0 + (9/2) = 9/2 \), as before.

Case 2: \( 1","[sqrt(a)/b, '\\sqrt{a}/b']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3, and it's -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3. I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, that sounds like I need to find the values of x such that f(x) equals 0 and 6, respectively, and then add those x values together.

Let me start with f inverse of 0. That means I need to solve f(x) = 0. Since f is piecewise, I have to check both pieces.

First, let's consider the first piece: 3 - x. If x ≤ 3, then f(x) = 3 - x. So, set that equal to 0:

3 - x = 0

Solving for x, I get x = 3. Okay, so x = 3 is a solution. But wait, I should check if this x is within the domain of the first piece, which is x ≤ 3. Yes, 3 is equal to 3, so that's valid.

Now, let's check the second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x. This is for x > 3. So, set that equal to 0:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0

Hmm, let's factor this equation. Maybe factor out an x:

x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0

So, either x = 0 or -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

But wait, in this case, we're considering x > 3, so x = 0 is not in the domain of this piece. So, we can ignore x = 0.

Now, solve -x² + 2x + 3 = 0. Let's multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

x² - 2x - 3 = 0

Now, factor this quadratic. Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, that would be -3 and +1.

So, (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0

Thus, x = 3 or x = -1.

Again, in this piece, x > 3, so x = 3 is not in the domain, and x = -1 is also not in the domain. So, the second piece doesn't give us any solutions for f(x) = 0.

Therefore, the only solution is x = 3. So, f inverse of 0 is 3.

Now, moving on to f inverse of 6. So, we need to solve f(x) = 6. Again, check both pieces.

First, the first piece: 3 - x. For x ≤ 3, set 3 - x = 6.

Solving for x: 3 - x = 6 => -x = 3 => x = -3.

Check if x = -3 is in the domain of the first piece, which is x ≤ 3. Yes, -3 is less than 3, so that's valid.

Now, check the second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6.

So, set up the equation:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Bring 6 to the left side:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

Let me rewrite this as:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

Hmm, maybe factor this. Let's factor out a negative sign first to make it easier:

- (x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6) = 0

So, x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Now, let's try to factor this cubic equation. Maybe use rational root theorem. Possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Let's test x = 1:

1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0

x = 2:

8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root.

So, we can factor out (x - 2). Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with x = 2:

Coefficients: 1 | -2 | -3 | 6

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 2: 2. Add to -2: 0.

Multiply 0 by 2: 0. Add to -3: -3.

Multiply -3 by 2: -6. Add to 6: 0. Perfect.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 0x - 3) = (x - 2)(x² - 3)

So, x² - 3 = 0 gives x = sqrt(3) or x = -sqrt(3). But in this piece, x > 3, so sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, which is less than 3, so not in the domain. Similarly, -sqrt(3) is negative, so also not in the domain.

Therefore, the only solution from the second piece is x = 2, but wait, x = 2 is not greater than 3, so it's not in the domain of the second piece. So, the second piece doesn't give a valid solution for f(x) = 6.

Therefore, the only solution is x = -3 from the first piece.

Wait, hold on. So, f inverse of 6 is -3.

But wait, let me double-check. If x = -3, which is ≤ 3, so f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6. Yes, that's correct.

So, f inverse of 6 is -3.

Therefore, f inverse of 0 is 3, and f inverse of 6 is -3. So, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't miss any solutions.

For f inverse of 0, we had x = 3 from the first piece, and the second piece didn't give any solutions. So, that's correct.

For f inverse of 6, we had x = -3 from the first piece, and the second piece gave x = 2, which is not in the domain, so only x = -3 is valid. So, that's correct.

Therefore, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

Hmm, so the answer is 0.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that the second piece could have another solution? For f(x) = 6, in the second piece, we had x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0, which factored to (x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0. So, x = 2, sqrt(3), -sqrt(3). None of these are greater than 3, so indeed, no solution in the second piece.

Therefore, f inverse of 6 is only -3.

So, f inverse of 0 is 3, f inverse of 6 is -3, sum is 0.

Wait, but let me check if f is invertible. For a function to have an inverse, it needs to be bijective, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Since f is piecewise, we need to check if it's strictly increasing or decreasing in each piece and if there's any overlap in the ranges.

First piece: f(x) = 3 - x for x ≤ 3. This is a linear function with slope -1, so it's decreasing. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity, and at x = 3, f(3) = 0.

Second piece: f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x for x > 3. Let's analyze its behavior. Let's compute its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.

f'(x) = -3x² + 4x + 3.

Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

-3x² + 4x + 3 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1: 3x² - 4x - 3 = 0

Using quadratic formula: x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 36)] / 6 = [4 ± sqrt(52)] / 6 = [4 ± 2*sqrt(13)] / 6 = [2 ± sqrt(13)] / 3.

Compute approximate values: sqrt(13) ≈ 3.606, so [2 + 3.606]/3 ≈ 5.606/3 ≈ 1.869, and [2 - 3.606]/3 ≈ negative, which we can ignore since x > 3.

So, the critical point is around x ≈ 1.869, which is less than 3, so in the domain x > 3, the derivative is:

At x = 4, f'(4) = -3*(16) + 4*4 + 3 = -48 + 16 + 3 = -29, which is negative. So, the function is decreasing for x > 3.

Wait, so the second piece is decreasing for x > 3, starting from x = 3. Let's compute f(3) from the second piece: f(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, at x = 3, both pieces meet at f(3) = 0.

But wait, the first piece at x = 3 is 3 - 3 = 0, and the second piece at x = 3 is also 0. So, the function is continuous at x = 3.

Now, since the first piece is decreasing from x = -infty to x = 3, going from +infty to 0, and the second piece is also decreasing from x = 3 onwards, starting at 0 and going to negative infinity as x increases.

Therefore, the entire function f(x) is strictly decreasing over its entire domain, which is all real numbers. Therefore, it is one-to-one, so it has an inverse function.

Therefore, each value in the range corresponds to exactly one x, so f inverse of 0 is 3, and f inverse of 6 is -3, so their sum is 0.

Wait, but let me confirm f inverse of 6 is indeed -3. So, f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6, correct. And f(3) = 0, correct. So, yes, that seems right.

Therefore, the answer is 0.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) for the piecewise function \( f(x) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

First, we solve \( f(x) = 0 \):

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   This is valid since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   Solving \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) gives \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \), neither of which are valid since \( x > 3 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, we solve \( f(x) = 6 \):

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   This is valid since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
   \]
   Factoring gives \( (x - 2)(x^2 - 3) = 0 \), leading to \( x = 2 \), \( x = \sqrt{3} \), or \( x = -\sqrt{3} \), none of which are valid since \( x > 3 \).

Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results together:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

\[
\boxed{0}

"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a point P and a regular octahedron. The distances from P to five of the octahedron's vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular octahedron has eight triangular faces and six vertices, right? It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases.

First, let me visualize the octahedron. It has six vertices, and in a regular octahedron, all edges are of equal length. The vertices can be thought of as being at the points (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,-1) in a coordinate system. So, each vertex is along one of the axes, either positive or negative.

Now, the point P is somewhere in space, and we know its distances to five of these vertices. The distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the sixth distance. Hmm, how can I approach this?

I recall that in problems involving distances from a point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron, sometimes the concept of the ""sum of squares"" of the distances can be useful. Maybe I can use some properties related to coordinates or vectors here.

Let me denote the coordinates of point P as (x, y, z). Then, the distances from P to each vertex can be expressed using the distance formula. For example, the distance from P to (1,0,0) is sqrt[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2], and similarly for the other vertices.

But since the octahedron is regular and symmetric, maybe there's a relationship between the squares of these distances. Let me think about the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices.

If I denote the six distances as d1, d2, d3, d4, d5, d6, then the sum of their squares might have a particular relationship. Let me try to compute this sum.

For each vertex, the square of the distance from P is:

- For (1,0,0): (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
- For (-1,0,0): (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
- For (0,1,0): x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2
- For (0,-1,0): x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2
- For (0,0,1): x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2
- For (0,0,-1): x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2

If I add all these up, let's see what happens:

Sum = [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]

Let me expand each term:

First term: (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
Second term: (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
Third term: x^2 + (y^2 - 2y + 1) + z^2
Fourth term: x^2 + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + z^2
Fifth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1)
Sixth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1)

Now, let's add all these together:

Sum = [x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1]

Let me count the number of each term:

- x^2 terms: There are 6 terms, each contributing x^2, so 6x^2
- y^2 terms: Similarly, 6y^2
- z^2 terms: 6z^2
- Linear terms: -2x, +2x, -2y, +2y, -2z, +2z. These will cancel out: (-2x + 2x) + (-2y + 2y) + (-2z + 2z) = 0
- Constants: Each term has a +1, and there are 6 terms, so 6*1 = 6

So, the sum simplifies to:

Sum = 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6

But wait, 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 is equal to 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So,

Sum = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6

But also, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex is equal to the sum of d1^2 + d2^2 + d3^2 + d4^2 + d5^2 + d6^2.

So, if I denote S = d1^2 + d2^2 + d3^2 + d4^2 + d5^2 + d6^2, then:

S = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6

But I don't know x, y, z, so maybe I can express this in terms of the given distances.

Wait, but I know five of the distances: 3, 7, 8, 9, 11. Let me denote the sixth distance as d. So,

S = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2

Calculating that:

3^2 = 9

7^2 = 49

8^2 = 64

9^2 = 81

11^2 = 121

So, sum of squares of known distances: 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = let's compute step by step:

9 + 49 = 58

58 + 64 = 122

122 + 81 = 203

203 + 121 = 324

So, S = 324 + d^2

But from earlier, S = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6

So,

324 + d^2 = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6

Let me rearrange this:

6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 324 + d^2 - 6 = 318 + d^2

So,

x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (318 + d^2)/6

Hmm, okay. Now, is there another equation I can use to relate x, y, z, and d?

Wait, maybe I can consider the distances from P to the vertices in pairs. For example, the distance to (1,0,0) and (-1,0,0) are related. Similarly for the others.

Let me denote:

Let’s say the distance from P to (1,0,0) is a, to (-1,0,0) is b, to (0,1,0) is c, to (0,-1,0) is d, to (0,0,1) is e, and to (0,0,-1) is f.

But in the problem, the distances are given as 3,7,8,9,11, and we need to find the sixth. So, perhaps I can pair them as (a,b), (c,d), (e,f). Each pair corresponds to opposite vertices along each axis.

I remember that for a point P(x,y,z), the sum of the squares of the distances to two opposite vertices can be expressed in terms of x, y, z.

For example, the distance to (1,0,0) is sqrt[(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2], and to (-1,0,0) is sqrt[(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2]. If I square both and add them:

[(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

Similarly, for the y-axis pair:

[(x)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

And for the z-axis pair:

[x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2] = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

So, each pair of opposite vertices contributes 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2 to the sum of squares.

Therefore, if I denote the pairs as (a,b), (c,d), (e,f), then:

a^2 + b^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2

Similarly,

c^2 + d^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2

e^2 + f^2 = 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2

So, each pair sums to the same value, which is 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2.

Therefore, if I can group the given distances into three pairs, each pair should sum to the same value.

But wait, in the problem, we have five distances: 3,7,8,9,11, and we need to find the sixth. So, perhaps the given distances include one from each pair, except one pair which has both distances given or something?

Wait, no. Since there are three pairs, each pair has two distances. So, if we have five distances, that means one pair is completely given (both distances), and the other two pairs have one distance each, and the sixth distance is the remaining one in the third pair.

Wait, but let me think again. If each pair must sum to the same value, then if I can find which pairs sum to the same value, I can find the missing distance.

But since we have five distances, perhaps one pair is completely known, and the other two pairs have one known and one unknown each.

Wait, but let me see. Let me denote the three pairs as Pair1, Pair2, Pair3.

Each pair has two distances, say, (a,b), (c,d), (e,f). Each pair sums to the same value, say, K.

So, a^2 + b^2 = K

c^2 + d^2 = K

e^2 + f^2 = K

So, if I can find K, then I can find the missing distance.

But since we have five distances, perhaps two of the pairs have one known distance each, and one pair has both distances known. Wait, but in the problem, we have five distances, so maybe two pairs have both distances given, and one pair has one given and one unknown? Hmm, no, because each pair has two distances, so if we have five distances, that would mean two pairs are completely given (total four distances) and one pair has one given and one unknown. But that would require five distances, which is the case here.

Wait, but in the problem, we have five distances: 3,7,8,9,11. So, perhaps two pairs are completely given, and one pair has one given and one unknown. But wait, that would require four distances for two pairs, and one distance for the third pair, leaving one unknown. But we have five distances, so maybe one pair is completely given, and the other two pairs have two distances each, but one of them is missing.

Wait, this is getting confusing. Maybe I should try to compute K.

Wait, from earlier, we have:

Sum of all six distances squared is S = 324 + d^2, and also S = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6.

But also, each pair sums to K, so 3 pairs, each summing to K, so total sum S = 3K.

Therefore, 3K = 324 + d^2

But also, from the pair sums, each pair is K, so K = a^2 + b^2 for each pair.

But since we have five distances, perhaps two pairs are known, and one pair has one known and one unknown.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me compute K.

If I can find K, then I can find the missing distance.

But how?

Wait, if I can find K, then since S = 3K, and S = 324 + d^2, then 3K = 324 + d^2.

But I don't know K or d.

Alternatively, maybe I can find K by considering that each pair must have the same sum.

So, let's see, the given distances are 3,7,8,9,11. Let me see if any two of these can form a pair that sums to the same K.

Wait, but K is the sum of squares, not the sum. So, I need to find two numbers among 3,7,8,9,11 whose squares add up to the same value as another pair.

Wait, let me compute the squares:

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x - 1) \), I can use a simple method. Instead of expanding the entire polynomial, I can substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( g(x) \). This works because substituting \( x = 1 \) into a polynomial effectively sums all its coefficients.

So, \( g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) \).

Next, I calculate \( f(0) \) by substituting \( x = 0 \) into the original polynomial \( f(x) \):

Daná priamka je y = 2x - 2, takže jej smernica je 2. Smernica kolmej priamky bude teda -1/2, pretože je to negatívna reziprokná hodnota.

Takže rovnica kolmej priamky bude y = (-1/2)x + b. Pretože prechádza bodom (6, 0), môžem dosadiť x = 6 a y = 0, aby som nájdl b.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the unordered set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the four distinct roots of the equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that for a quartic equation like \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\), the sum and products of the roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. So, maybe I can use that here.

Given the equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), let me write down the general form of a quartic equation and compare coefficients:

\(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\)

Comparing with the given equation:

\(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\)

So, \(a = 2\), \(b = 0\), \(c = 0\), and \(d = 2\).

Now, Vieta's formulas tell us that:

1. The sum of the roots: \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a = -2\)
2. The sum of the products of the roots two at a time: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b = 0\)
3. The sum of the products of the roots three at a time: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c = 0\)
4. The product of all roots: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d = 2\)

Okay, so I have these four equations. Now, the problem is asking for the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let me denote these three expressions as \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) respectively. So,

\(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)

\(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\)

\(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\)

I need to find the unordered set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\).

Hmm, so I need to find these three sums. Let me think about how to compute them using the information from Vieta's formulas.

I know that the sum of all products two at a time is zero:

\(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)

If I denote \(S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3\), then:

\(S = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

But wait, that's exactly the sum of all products two at a time, which is zero. So, \(S = 0\). Therefore, \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\).

Okay, that's one equation. Now, I need more information to find the individual values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Maybe I can find the sum of their squares or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products of these sums. Let me think about \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). Hmm, that might be complicated, but maybe I can find another relation.

Wait, another approach: perhaps I can consider the polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). If I can find such a polynomial, then I can find the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) by finding its roots.

To construct such a polynomial, I can use symmetric sums. Let me denote the polynomial as \(y^3 - p y^2 + q y - r = 0\), where \(p = S_1 + S_2 + S_3\), \(q = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3\), and \(r = S_1 S_2 S_3\).

We already know that \(p = 0\), so the polynomial becomes \(y^3 + q y - r = 0\).

Now, I need to find \(q\) and \(r\). Let's compute \(q = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3\).

First, let's compute \(S_1 S_2\):

\(S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\)

Let me expand this:

\(= \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_1 \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4^2\)

Hmm, that seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates the products of these sums to the elementary symmetric sums.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider the square of the sum of all products two at a time.

We know that \((\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 0^2 = 0\).

Expanding this square, we get:

\(\sum (\alpha_i \alpha_j)^2 + 2 \sum (\alpha_i \alpha_j \alpha_k \alpha_l)\) where \(i < j\) and \(k < l\), and all indices are distinct.

Wait, that might not be the easiest path. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), and also the sum of their squares.

Let me compute \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), we have:

\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 - 2(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3) = 0 - 2q = -2q\)

So, if I can compute \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\), I can find \(q\).

Let me compute \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2\):

Each \(S_i\) is a sum of two products, so squaring each:

\(S_1^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 + 2 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 + \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4^2\)

Similarly,

\(S_2^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 \alpha_3^2 + 2 \alpha_1 \alpha_3 \alpha_2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4^2\)

\(S_3^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 = \alpha_1^2 \alpha_4^2 + 2 \alpha_1 \alpha_4 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_3^2\)

Adding them up:

\(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1^2 \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4^2) + (\alpha_1^2 \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_3^2) + 2 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 (1 + 1 + 1)\)

Simplify:

First, the squared terms:

\(\alpha_1^2 \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2 \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2 \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4^2\)

And the cross terms:

\(6 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4\)

So, \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\sum \alpha_i^2 \alpha_j^2) + 6 \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4\)

Now, I need to compute \(\sum \alpha_i^2 \alpha_j^2\) where \(i < j\). Let me denote this sum as \(T\).

So, \(T = \sum_{1 \leq i < j \leq 4} \alpha_i^2 \alpha_j^2\)

I think this can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric sums. Let me recall that:

\((\sum \alpha_i \alpha_j)^2 = \sum \alpha_i^2 \alpha_j^2 + 2 \sum \alpha_i \alpha_j \alpha_k \alpha_l\)

Wait, that's similar to what I thought earlier. Let me write it down:

\((\sum_{i < j} \alpha_i \alpha_j)^2 = \sum_{i < j} \alpha_i^2 \alpha_j^2 + 2 \sum_{i < j < k < l} \alpha_i \alpha_j \alpha_k \alpha_l\)

But in our case, the sum \(\sum_{i < j} \alpha_i \alpha_j = 0\), as we know from Vieta. So,

\(0^2 = T + 2 \sum_{i < j < k < l} \alpha_i \alpha_j \alpha_k \alpha_l\)

But the sum \(\sum_{i < j < k < l} \alpha_i \alpha_j \alpha_k \alpha_l\) is just the product of all four roots, which is \(\alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 = 2\). So,

\(0 = T + 2 \times 2\)

Therefore, \(T = -4\)

So, going back to \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = T + 6 \times \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 = -4 + 6 \times 2 = -4 + 12 = 8\)

Therefore, \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = 8\)

But earlier, we had \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = -2q\), so:

\(-2q = 8 \implies q = -4\)

So, now we have \(q = -4\). So, the polynomial becomes \(y^3 - 4y - r = 0\). Now, we need to find \(r = S_1 S_2 S_3\).

Hmm, how can I compute \(r = S_1 S_2 S_3\)? Let me think.

Let me compute \(S_1 S_2 S_3\):

\(S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\)

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a way to express this in terms of the elementary symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression for the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the roots.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_i\), which is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Maybe I can find a relationship by considering the products of pairs of roots.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) to the coefficients of the original polynomial.

Wait, I recall that in symmetric polynomials, the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Let me try to compute it.

First, let me note that:

\(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\)

Similarly, \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha","[Eq(S_1, alpha_1*alpha_2 + alpha_3*alpha_4), 'S_1 = \\alpha_1\\alpha_2 + \\alpha_3\\alpha_4']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four corners. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Let's say AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. The center O is where the diagonals intersect, so it's the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Given that AB/AD = k, so if I let AD be the height of the rectangle, then AB is the length, and their ratio is k. Maybe it's easier if I assign some variables. Let me denote AD as h, so AB would be k*h. That way, the rectangle has length k*h and height h.

Since O is the center, its coordinates would be the midpoint of the rectangle. If I place the rectangle on a coordinate system with O at (0,0), then the coordinates of the corners would be: A at (-k*h/2, h/2), B at (k*h/2, h/2), C at (k*h/2, -h/2), and D at (-k*h/2, -h/2). Wait, actually, if AB is the top side, then maybe I should adjust the coordinates accordingly. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to set the rectangle such that its sides are aligned with the axes, with O at (0,0). So, the rectangle would extend from (-a, -b) to (a, b), where a = AB/2 and b = AD/2. Then, AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so the ratio AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a = k*b. That might be a cleaner way to set it up.

So, let me define the rectangle with sides from (-k*b, -b) to (k*b, b). So, the length is 2k*b and the height is 2b, making the ratio AB/AD = (2k*b)/(2b) = k, which fits the given condition.

Now, the problem is to find the probability that a randomly selected point inside this rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four corners. So, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point in that region is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D.

To find this region, I can think about the set of points equidistant to O and each corner. The boundary between the regions where a point is closer to O and closer to a corner is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining O and that corner.

So, for each corner, I can find the perpendicular bisector between O and that corner, and the intersection of these bisectors will form the boundary of the region where points are closer to O than to any corner.

Let me start by finding the perpendicular bisector between O and one corner, say A. The coordinates of A are (-k*b, b). The midpoint between O(0,0) and A(-k*b, b) is (-k*b/2, b/2). The slope of OA is (b - 0)/(-k*b - 0) = -1/k. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of k (negative reciprocal).

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector between O and A is y - b/2 = k(x + k*b/2). Let me write that out:

y - (b/2) = k(x + (k*b)/2)

Simplify:

y = kx + (k^2*b)/2 + b/2

Similarly, I can find the perpendicular bisectors for the other corners.

For corner B(k*b, b), the midpoint is (k*b/2, b/2). The slope of OB is (b - 0)/(k*b - 0) = 1/k, so the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of -k.

Equation: y - b/2 = -k(x - k*b/2)

Simplify:

y = -kx + (k^2*b)/2 + b/2

For corner C(k*b, -b), the midpoint is (k*b/2, -b/2). The slope of OC is (-b - 0)/(k*b - 0) = -1/k, so the perpendicular bisector has slope k.

Equation: y + b/2 = k(x - k*b/2)

Simplify:

y = kx - (k^2*b)/2 - b/2

For corner D(-k*b, -b), the midpoint is (-k*b/2, -b/2). The slope of OD is (-b - 0)/(-k*b - 0) = 1/k, so the perpendicular bisector has slope -k.

Equation: y + b/2 = -k(x + k*b/2)

Simplify:

y = -kx - (k^2*b)/2 - b/2

So, now I have four lines:

1. From A: y = kx + (k^2*b + b)/2
2. From B: y = -kx + (k^2*b + b)/2
3. From C: y = kx - (k^2*b + b)/2
4. From D: y = -kx - (k^2*b + b)/2

These four lines form a diamond (a rotated square) inside the rectangle. The region where points are closer to O than to any corner is the area inside this diamond.

Wait, let me confirm that. The perpendicular bisectors between O and each corner divide the plane into regions where points are closer to O or to a corner. The intersection of all the regions closer to O would be the area bounded by all four bisectors, which is a convex polygon, likely a quadrilateral.

But in this case, since the rectangle is symmetric, the region closer to O than to any corner should be a smaller rectangle or perhaps another shape. Hmm, maybe it's a square rotated by 45 degrees, forming a diamond shape.

Wait, let me think again. Each bisector is a line, and the intersection of all four regions (closer to O than A, closer to O than B, closer to O than C, closer to O than D) would be the area where all four inequalities hold: distance to O < distance to A, distance to O < distance to B, etc.

So, the boundaries are the four lines I found. The region inside all four lines is the intersection, which is a convex polygon. Let me find the points where these lines intersect each other.

First, find the intersection of the bisectors from A and B.

Set y = kx + (k^2*b + b)/2 equal to y = -kx + (k^2*b + b)/2.

So:

kx + (k^2*b + b)/2 = -kx + (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

2kx = 0 => x = 0

Then y = (k^2*b + b)/2

So, the intersection point is (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2)

Similarly, find the intersection of bisectors from B and C.

Set y = -kx + (k^2*b + b)/2 equal to y = kx - (k^2*b + b)/2.

So:

-kx + (k^2*b + b)/2 = kx - (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

-2kx = - (k^2*b + b)

So, x = (k^2*b + b)/(2k) = b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)

Then, plug back into one of the equations:

y = -k*(b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)) + (k^2*b + b)/2

Simplify:

y = - (k^2 + 1)*b/2 + (k^2 + 1)*b/2 = 0

So, the intersection point is (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)

Similarly, find the intersection of bisectors from C and D.

Set y = kx - (k^2*b + b)/2 equal to y = -kx - (k^2*b + b)/2.

So:

kx - (k^2*b + b)/2 = -kx - (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

2kx = 0 => x = 0

Then y = - (k^2*b + b)/2

So, the intersection point is (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2)

Lastly, find the intersection of bisectors from D and A.

Set y = -kx - (k^2*b + b)/2 equal to y = kx + (k^2*b + b)/2.

So:

-kx - (k^2*b + b)/2 = kx + (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

-2kx = (k^2*b + b)

So, x = - (k^2*b + b)/(2k) = -b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)

Then, plug back into one of the equations:

y = -k*(-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)) - (k^2*b + b)/2

Simplify:

y = (k^2 + 1)*b/2 - (k^2 + 1)*b/2 = 0

So, the intersection point is (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)

So, now I have four intersection points:

1. (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2)
2. (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)
3. (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2)
4. (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)

These four points form a diamond shape centered at O. The diamond has vertices at these four points.

Now, I need to find the area of this diamond and then divide it by the area of the rectangle to get the probability.

First, let's compute the area of the diamond. Since it's a diamond (a rhombus), its area can be calculated as (d1 * d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

Looking at the points, the vertical diagonal goes from (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2) to (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2), so its length is (k^2 + 1)*b.

The horizontal diagonal goes from (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0) to (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0), so its length is 2 * [b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)] = b(k^2 + 1)/k.

Therefore, the area of the diamond is:

Area_diamond = (d1 * d2)/2 = [(k^2 + 1)*b * (b(k^2 + 1)/k)] / 2

Simplify:

= [b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2 / k] / 2

= (b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2) / (2k)

Now, the area of the rectangle is length * height = (2k*b) * (2b) = 4k*b^2.

Wait, hold on. Earlier, I set the rectangle from (-k*b, -b) to (k*b, b), so the length is 2k*b and the height is 2b. So, area is 2k*b * 2b = 4k*b^2. Correct.

So, the probability is Area_diamond / Area_rectangle = [ (b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2) / (2k) ] / (4k*b^2 )

Simplify:

= [ (k^2 + 1)^2 / (2k) ] / (4k )

= (k^2 + 1)^2 / (8k^2 )

Wait, let me double-check that.

Wait, Area_diamond is (b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2) / (2k)

Area_rectangle is 4k*b^2

So, probability = ( (b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2) / (2k) ) / (4k*b^2 ) = ( (k^2 + 1)^2 ) / (8k^2 )

Yes, that's correct.

So, the probability is (k^2 + 1)^2 / (8k^2 )

But wait, let me think again. Is this correct? Because when k = 1, the rectangle is a square, and I remember that in a square, the region where points are closer to the center than to the corners is a smaller square rotated by 45 degrees, and its area is 1/2 of the original square. Let me check if my formula gives that.

If k = 1, then probability = (1 + 1)^2 / (8*1) = 4 / 8 = 1/2. That's correct. So, that seems to check out.

Another test case: suppose k is very large, meaning the rectangle is very long and skinny. Then, the region closer to O than to the corners should be small. Let's see what the formula gives.

As k approaches infinity, (k^2 + 1)^2 / (8k^2 ) ≈ (k^4) / (8k^2 ) = k^2 / 8, which goes to infinity. Wait, that can't be right because the area can't exceed the area of the rectangle, which is 4k*b^2. Wait, but in reality, as k increases, the diamond's area should decrease because the rectangle becomes longer, making the region closer to O smaller.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in calculating the area of the diamond.

Wait, let's go back. The diamond's diagonals are (k^2 + 1)*b and b(k^2 + 1)/k. So, the area is (d1*d2)/2 = [(k^2 + 1)*b * (b(k^2 + 1)/k)] / 2 = [b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2 / k ] / 2 = (b^2 (k^2 + 1)^2 ) / (2k )

But the area of the rectangle is 4k*b^2.

So, the probability is ( (k^2 + 1)^2 ) / (8k^2 )

Wait, but when k is very large, (k^2 + 1)^2 ≈ k^4","[1, '1)^2']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True

"First, I need to evaluate each function argument individually.

"Okay, so I have this magic square problem here. A magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same. The grid is 3x3, and some of the cells are filled with expressions involving n, while others are just numbers. My goal is to find the value of n.

First, let me try to visualize the magic square based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like the grid is divided into cells, and each cell has a label. Let me list out the cells with their respective expressions or numbers.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the grid is labeled as follows:

- The first row (top row) has cells: (0.5, 0.5) labeled ""n-3"", (0.5, 1.5) labeled ""3"", and (0.5, 2.5) labeled ""n+1"".
- The second row has cells: (1.5, 0.5) labeled ""n+2"", (1.5, 1.5) labeled ""2n-9"", and (1.5, 2.5) labeled ""1"".
- The third row has cells: (2.5, 0.5) labeled ""2"", (2.5, 1.5) labeled ""n"", and (2.5, 2.5) labeled ""n-1"".

Wait, actually, hold on. The Asymptote code is a bit confusing because it's using coordinates. Let me parse it correctly. The first set of labels are at positions (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (0.5, 2.5). Since the grid is 3x3, each cell is a square from (0,0) to (3,3). So, the center of each cell is at (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), (2.5, 0.5) for the first row; (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5) for the second row; and (0.5, 2.5), (1.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5) for the third row.

So, reconstructing the magic square:

First row (top row):
- First cell: n - 3
- Second cell: 3
- Third cell: n + 1

Second row:
- First cell: n + 2
- Second cell: 2n - 9
- Third cell: 1

Third row (bottom row):
- First cell: 2
- Second cell: n
- Third cell: n - 1

So, the magic square looks like this:

```
n-3 | 3 | n+1
n+2 |2n-9| 1
2 | n | n-1
```

Now, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals must add up to the same sum. Let's denote this common sum as S.

Let me write down the equations based on the rows, columns, and diagonals.

First, let's consider the rows:

1. First row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S
2. Second row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S
3. Third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = S

Similarly, for the columns:

1. First column: (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = S
2. Second column: 3 + (2n - 9) + n = S
3. Third column: (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = S

And the diagonals:

1. Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = S
2. Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = S

So, now I have several equations. Let me compute each of them step by step.

Starting with the first row:

1. (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 = S

Second row:

2. (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 = S

Third row:

3. 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 = S

So, from the first and third rows, we have S = 2n + 1, and from the second row, S = 3n - 6. Therefore, we can set them equal:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6

Solving for n:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6  
Subtract 2n from both sides:  
1 = n - 6  
Add 6 to both sides:  
n = 7

Wait, so n is 7? Let me check if this holds with the columns and diagonals.

Let me compute S first. If n = 7, then S = 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 15.

Now, let's check the columns.

First column:

(n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. Good.

Second column:

3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. Perfect.

Third column:

(n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15. Nice.

Now, the diagonals.

Main diagonal:

(n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Other diagonal:

(n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15.

Everything adds up to 15 when n = 7. So, that seems consistent.

But just to be thorough, let me reconstruct the entire magic square with n = 7 and verify all sums.

First row: 7 - 3 = 4, 3, 7 + 1 = 8. So, 4 + 3 + 8 = 15.

Second row: 7 + 2 = 9, 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, 1. So, 9 + 5 + 1 = 15.

Third row: 2, 7, 7 - 1 = 6. So, 2 + 7 + 6 = 15.

Columns:

First column: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15.

Second column: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

Third column: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15.

Diagonals:

4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

8 + 5 + 2 = 15.

Everything checks out. So, n = 7 is indeed the correct value.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all the sums are consistent when n is 7. So, I'm confident that n is 7.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{7}.

Given a 3x3 magic square where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same, we need to find the value of \( n \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\
\hline
n + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n - 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We denote the common sum as \( S \).

First, we calculate the sums of the rows:

1. First row: \( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 = S \)
2. Second row: \( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6 = S \)
3. Third row: \( 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2n + 1 = S \)

From the first and third rows, we have \( S = 2n + 1 \). From the second row, we have \( S = 3n - 6 \). Setting these equal:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\
1 = n - 6 \\
n = 7
\]

We verify this by checking the columns and diagonals with \( n = 7 \):

- First column: \( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
- Main diagonal: \( (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

All sums are consistent, confirming \( n = 7 \).

The value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"Prvým krokom je určiť dĺžku diagonály obdĺžnikového poľa.

"Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². But since ω³ = 1, and we're dealing with complex numbers, ω can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined (since 1 + 1 = 2, but wait, no, actually 1 + 1 is 2, which is fine. Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me clarify.

The cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. So, ω and ω² are the non-real cube roots of unity. So, in this problem, ω can be either ω or ω², right? Because if ω is 1, then the expression becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But wait, is that allowed? Let me check.

If ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2 and 1 + ω² = 2, so the expression is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I think the problem is more interesting when ω is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1. So, maybe the problem is considering ω as a primitive root, but I'm not sure. Let me proceed.

I recall that for cube roots of unity, we have the property that 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That might be useful here. Let me write that down:

1 + ω + ω² = 0.

So, from this, we can express ω² as -1 - ω. Maybe that can help simplify the expression.

Let me write the expression again:

S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

Since ω² = -1 - ω, let's substitute that into the second term:

S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + (-1 - ω)).

Simplify the denominator in the second term:

1 + (-1 - ω) = 1 - 1 - ω = -ω.

So, the second term becomes 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.

So now, S = 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.

Hmm, okay. Let me see if I can combine these two terms. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and ω, so the common denominator is ω(1 + ω).

So, let's rewrite each term:

1/(1 + ω) = ω / [ω(1 + ω)],
-1/ω = -(1 + ω) / [ω(1 + ω)].

So, combining them:

S = [ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)].

Simplify the numerator:

ω - 1 - ω = -1.

So, S = -1 / [ω(1 + ω)].

Hmm, that's interesting. So, S = -1 / [ω(1 + ω)].

But I can maybe simplify this further. Let's see.

First, let's compute ω(1 + ω). That's ω + ω².

But from the earlier equation, 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1.

Therefore, ω(1 + ω) = -1.

So, substituting back into S:

S = -1 / (-1) = 1.

Wait, so S = 1? But earlier, when I considered ω = 1, I also got S = 1. So, does that mean that regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive root, the expression S is always 1?

But wait, if ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² = 2, so S = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, yes, in that case, it's 1. If ω is a primitive root, then we also get S = 1. So, is the only possible value 1?

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, especially roots of unity, there can be multiple cases or something I might have missed.

Let me try another approach. Let's compute S directly for ω = 1 and ω = ω (primitive root).

Case 1: ω = 1.

Then, S = 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Case 2: ω is a primitive cube root of unity, so ω ≠ 1.

In this case, we can use the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω² = -1 - ω.

So, let's compute S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

Substitute ω² = -1 - ω:

S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + (-1 - ω)) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(-ω).

Simplify the second term:

1/(-ω) = -1/ω.

So, S = 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.

To combine these, let's find a common denominator, which is ω(1 + ω):

S = [ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)] = [ω - 1 - ω] / [ω(1 + ω)] = (-1) / [ω(1 + ω)].

Now, compute ω(1 + ω):

ω(1 + ω) = ω + ω².

But from 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we have ω + ω² = -1.

So, ω(1 + ω) = -1.

Therefore, S = (-1)/(-1) = 1.

So, in both cases, whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, S = 1.

Wait, but hold on. If ω is 1, then ω² is also 1, so 1 + ω² is 2, which is fine. But if ω is a primitive root, then ω² is another primitive root, so 1 + ω² is not zero, so the denominators are defined.

Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression S is always equal to 1.

But let me check numerically with a specific primitive cube root of unity. Let's take ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2.

Compute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.

So, compute 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

[1 * (1/2 - i√3/2)] / [(1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2)] = (1/2 - i√3/2) / (1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

[1 * (1/2 + i√3/2)] / [(1/2 - i√3/2)(1/2 + i√3/2)] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Now, add them together:

(1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.

So, numerically, it also gives 1. Therefore, the expression is indeed always equal to 1, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

**Final Answer**
The only possible value is \boxed{1}.

Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we need to find all possible values of the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

First, we note that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are 1, \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega \neq 1\). We use the property of cube roots of unity that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We start by expressing the given expression:

\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

Using the property \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can substitute \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\):

\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)}
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
1 + (-1 - \omega) = -\omega
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
S = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}
\]

To combine these terms, we find a common denominator, which is \(\omega(1 + \omega)\):

\[
S = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}
\]

We know from the property of cube roots of unity that \(\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore:

\[
S = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1
\]

We also verify this result by considering \(\omega = 1\), which gives:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + 1} + \frac{1}{1 + 1} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]

Thus, regardless of whether \(\omega\) is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, the expression evaluates to 1.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest distance I can walk starting from any of the points A, B, C, or D, and then visiting the other three points once. The figure is drawn with Asymptote, and it shows a network of points connected by lines with specific lengths. Let me try to visualize it based on the code.

First, let me note down the coordinates of each point as given in the Asymptote code:

- A is at (-3, 3)
- B is at (3, 0)
- C is at (0, -4)
- D is at (0, 0)

So, D is at the origin, A is in the northwest, B is to the east, and C is directly south of D.

Looking at the connections:

- D is connected to B, C, and A.
- A is connected to B and D.
- B is connected to D, C, and A.
- C is connected to D, B, and A.

Wait, actually, looking at the Asymptote code, it draws D connected to B, then B connected to C, then C connected back to D, forming a triangle D-B-C. Then it draws D connected to A, A connected to B, and B connected back to D, forming another triangle D-A-B. Then it also draws D connected to A, A connected to C, and C connected back to D, forming another triangle D-A-C.

So, the figure is a combination of three triangles: D-B-C, D-A-B, and D-A-C. So, all points are connected through D, and A is connected to B and C, B is connected to C, and so on.

The lengths of the edges are given as:

- D to B: 3 units
- A to B: 6 units
- A to C: 6 units
- D to C: 4 units
- A to D: 5 units
- C to B: 5 units

So, let me list all the edges with their lengths:

- AB: 6
- AC: 6
- AD: 5
- BC: 5
- BD: 3
- CD: 4

So, the graph is a complete graph with four nodes, but not all edges are present. Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing specific edges, so maybe it's not a complete graph. Let me confirm:

From the code, the edges drawn are:

- D-B (3)
- B-C (5)
- C-D (4)
- D-A (5)
- A-B (6)
- A-C (6)

So, all possible edges except maybe A-D? Wait, no, A-D is 5. So, actually, all four points are connected to each other except maybe some? Wait, no, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing D-B, B-C, C-D, D-A, A-B, and A-C. So, all the edges except maybe C-A? Wait, no, A-C is drawn as 6. So, actually, all edges are present except maybe some? Wait, no, all edges are present because A is connected to B, C, D; B is connected to A, C, D; C is connected to A, B, D; D is connected to A, B, C. So, it's a complete graph K4 with four nodes, each connected to every other node, with the given edge lengths.

So, the problem is to find the shortest possible route that starts at any of the four points and visits the other three exactly once. So, it's essentially finding the shortest Hamiltonian path in this graph, where a Hamiltonian path visits each node exactly once.

But wait, the problem says ""navštívite ostatné tri body raz"", which translates to ""visit the other three points once"". So, starting from one point, you need to visit the other three, each exactly once, and find the shortest such path.

So, it's a traveling salesman problem (TSP) but only visiting four cities, so it's manageable.

Since it's a small graph, maybe I can compute all possible paths and find the shortest one.

First, let's note that the graph is undirected, so the distance from A to B is the same as B to A.

Given that, let's list all possible starting points and compute the shortest path from each.

But since the graph is symmetric, maybe some paths will have the same length regardless of direction.

But to be thorough, let's consider each starting point and compute the shortest path.

Alternatively, since it's a complete graph, the number of possible paths is 4! = 24, but since we can start at any point, maybe it's 4 * 3! = 24 as well.

But perhaps we can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, let's list all possible permutations of the four points, compute their total distance, and find the minimum.

But that might take a while, but since it's only 24 paths, maybe manageable.

But perhaps we can find a better approach.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, maybe we can find the shortest path by considering the distances.

Let me list all the edges with their lengths again:

AB: 6

AC: 6

AD: 5

BC: 5

BD: 3

CD: 4

So, the edges from D are the shortest: BD=3, CD=4, AD=5.

So, starting from D, the shortest edges go to B (3), then to C (4), then to A (5). But that's just the edges, not the path.

Wait, but in a path, we have to traverse edges without repeating nodes.

So, starting from D, the shortest first step is to B (3). From B, the next shortest edge is to C (5). From C, the next is to A (6). So, total distance: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Alternatively, starting from D, go to C (4), then to B (5), then to A (6). Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Alternatively, starting from D, go to A (5), then to B (6), then to C (5). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

Alternatively, starting from D, go to A (5), then to C (6), then to B (5). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

So, the shortest path starting from D is 14.

Now, let's check starting from B.

From B, the shortest edge is to D (3). From D, the next shortest is to C (4). From C, the next is to A (6). Total: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

Alternatively, from B, go to D (3), then to A (5), then to C (6). Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Alternatively, from B, go to C (5), then to D (4), then to A (5). Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14.

Alternatively, from B, go to C (5), then to A (6), then to D (5). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

Alternatively, from B, go to A (6), then to D (5), then to C (4). Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

Alternatively, from B, go to A (6), then to C (6), then to D (5). Total: 6 + 6 + 5 = 17.

So, the shortest path starting from B is 13.

Wait, that's better than starting from D.

Now, let's check starting from C.

From C, the shortest edge is to D (4). From D, the next shortest is to B (3). From B, the next is to A (6). Total: 4 + 3 + 6 = 13.

Alternatively, from C, go to D (4), then to A (5), then to B (6). Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Alternatively, from C, go to B (5), then to D (3), then to A (5). Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Alternatively, from C, go to B (5), then to A (6), then to D (5). Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

Alternatively, from C, go to A (6), then to D (5), then to B (3). Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14.

Alternatively, from C, go to A (6), then to B (6), then to D (5). Total: 6 + 6 + 5 = 17.

So, the shortest path starting from C is 13.

Now, starting from A.

From A, the shortest edge is to D (5). From D, the next shortest is to B (3). From B, the next is to C (5). Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Alternatively, from A, go to D (5), then to C (4), then to B (5). Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14.

Alternatively, from A, go to B (6), then to D (3), then to C (4). Total: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13.

Alternatively, from A, go to B (6), then to C (5), then to D (4). Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

Alternatively, from A, go to C (6), then to D (4), then to B (3). Total: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.

Alternatively, from A, go to C (6), then to B (5), then to D (5). Total: 6 + 5 + 5 = 16.

So, the shortest path starting from A is 13.

So, summarizing:

- Starting from D: shortest path is 14
- Starting from B: shortest path is 13
- Starting from C: shortest path is 13
- Starting from A: shortest path is 13

So, the overall shortest path is 13 units.

Wait, but let me double-check if there are any shorter paths.

Wait, when starting from B, the path B-D-C-A is 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

Similarly, starting from C, the path C-D-B-A is 4 + 3 + 6 = 13.

Starting from A, the path A-D-B-C is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Alternatively, A-B-D-C is 6 + 3 + 4 = 13.

Similarly, A-C-D-B is 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.

So, all these paths have a total distance of 13.

Is there a way to get shorter than 13?

Let me see. Maybe using a different combination.

Wait, is there a way to traverse some edges that are shorter?

Looking at the edges, the shortest edges are BD=3, CD=4, AD=5, BC=5, AB=6, AC=6.

So, the two shortest edges are BD=3 and CD=4.

If we can include both of these in a path, that would be good.

For example, starting at B, go to D (3), then to C (4), then to A (6). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at C, go to D (4), then to B (3), then to A (6). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at D, go to B (3), then to C (5), then to A (6). Total 14.

Wait, but if we start at D, the next step after B is C, which is 5, but if we go from D to C first, then to B, then to A, that's 4 + 5 + 6 = 15, which is longer.

So, the minimal path is 13.

Is there a way to have a path that uses BD=3 and CD=4, but in a different order?

Wait, if we start at B, go to D (3), then to C (4), then to A (6). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at C, go to D (4), then to B (3), then to A (6). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at A, go to D (5), then to B (3), then to C (5). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at A, go to B (6), then to D (3), then to C (4). Total 13.

So, all these paths give 13.

Is there a way to have a path that uses BD=3 and CD=4, but also uses another short edge?

Wait, for example, starting at B, go to D (3), then to C (4), then to A (6). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at B, go to C (5), then to D (4), then to A (5). Total 14.

So, 13 is better.

Similarly, starting at C, go to D (4), then to B (3), then to A (6). Total 13.

Alternatively, starting at C, go to B (5), then to D (3), then to A (5). Total 13.

Wait, that's 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 as well.

Wait, so starting from C, going to B (5), then to D (3), then to A (5). Total 13.

So, that's another path.

So, in all cases, the minimal path is 13.

Is there a way to get a shorter path?

Wait, let's see. If we can find a path that uses BD=3 and CD=4, and then a shorter edge from A.

But from A, the shortest edge is AD=5, but if we have already used D, we can't go back.

Wait, no, in a path, we can't revisit nodes, so once we leave D, we can't come back.

So, the minimal path is 13.

Wait, but let me check another possibility.

Suppose we start at A, go to D (5), then to C (4), then to B (5). Total 5 + 4 + 5 = 14.

Alternatively, A to C (6), then to D (4), then to B (3). Total 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.

So, that's another way to get 13.

So, yes, 13 is achievable.

Is there a way to get 12?

Let me see. The total of","[12, '12']",13,"[13, '13']",False
