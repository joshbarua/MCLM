"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a right triangle, and I need to find the length of DE. The diagram shows a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E. They told me that sin D is 0.7, and one of the sides, which is EF, is 7 units long. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what sine means in a right triangle. Sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, and the sides are DE, EF, and DF. Since it's a right triangle at E, DE and EF are the legs, and DF is the hypotenuse.

So, sin D = opposite side / hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle D would be EF, right? Because in angle D, the sides are DE (adjacent), DF (hypotenuse), and EF (opposite). So, sin D = EF / DF. They told me sin D is 0.7, and EF is 7. So, plugging in the values, 0.7 = 7 / DF. 

Wait, so if I solve for DF, that would be DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me calculate that. 7 divided by 0.7 is the same as 70 divided by 7, which is 10. So, DF is 10 units long. Okay, that gives me the hypotenuse.

Now, I need to find DE. Since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, DF² = DE² + EF². I know DF is 10 and EF is 7, so plugging those in: 10² = DE² + 7². That simplifies to 100 = DE² + 49.

To find DE², I subtract 49 from both sides: DE² = 100 - 49 = 51. So, DE is the square root of 51. Let me check if that makes sense. The square root of 51 is approximately 7.141, which seems reasonable because DE should be longer than EF since it's adjacent to the angle with sine 0.7, which is less than 1. Wait, actually, no, because in a right triangle, the side opposite the larger angle is longer. Since sin D is 0.7, which is less than 1, angle D is less than 90 degrees, so the side opposite, which is EF, is 7, and the other side DE is sqrt(51), which is approximately 7.141, so it's slightly longer than EF. That seems okay.

Alternatively, I could have used cosine to find DE. Since sin D = 0.7, then cos D would be sqrt(1 - sin² D) = sqrt(1 - 0.49) = sqrt(0.51). So, cos D is sqrt(0.51). Then, cos D is adjacent over hypotenuse, which is DE / DF. So, DE = DF * cos D = 10 * sqrt(0.51). Let me compute that: sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.7141, so 10 * 0.7141 is approximately 7.141, which is the same as sqrt(51). So, that checks out.

Wait, sqrt(51) is exactly equal to sqrt(51), so that's the exact value. So, DE is sqrt(51). Let me just make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my calculations. Starting from sin D = 0.7 = 7 / DF, so DF = 10. Then, using Pythagoras, DE² = 100 - 49 = 51, so DE = sqrt(51). Yep, that seems correct.

I think that's the answer. So, the length of DE is the square root of 51.

**Final Answer**
The length of DE is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the length of EF is 7 units. We need to find the length of DE.

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
Given \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for \(DF\):
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Thus, the length of DE is:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

The length of DE is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise. The given complex numbers are \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves a few steps. I think it's something like translating the complex plane so that \( c \) becomes the origin, then performing the rotation, and then translating back. Yeah, that sounds right. So, the general formula for rotating a point \( z \) around a point \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is:

\[ w = c + e^{i\theta}(z - c) \]

Let me verify that. If I subtract \( c \) from \( z \), I'm translating \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin. Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \) rotates it by \( \theta \) radians. Finally, adding \( c \) back translates it back to the original coordinate system. That makes sense.

So, in this case, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Therefore, \( e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} \). I know that \( e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \). Since \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), this simplifies to:

\[ e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Alright, so now I need to compute \( z - c \). Let's write down \( z \) and \( c \):

\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)

\( c = 2 - 3i \)

Subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):

\( z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) ] \)

Simplify the real part:

\( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

Simplify the imaginary part:

\( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = (-3\sqrt{2})i \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Hmm, that seems correct.

Now, I need to multiply this by \( e^{i\pi/4} \). Let me write that out:

\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

Let me compute this multiplication step by step. Let me denote \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = -3\sqrt{2} \) for simplicity. So, the expression becomes:

\[ (a + bi) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

Multiplying this out:

First, multiply \( a \) with each term in the second complex number:

\( a \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

\( a \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Next, multiply \( bi \) with each term in the second complex number:

\( bi \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = b \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i = (-3\sqrt{2}) \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i = (-3 \times 2)/2 i = -3i \)

\( bi \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = b \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i^2 = (-3\sqrt{2}) \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (-1) = (-3 \times 2)/2 \times (-1) = 3 \)

Now, adding all these together:

1 (from the first term) + i (from the second term) - 3i (from the third term) + 3 (from the fourth term)

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 1 + 3 = 4

Imaginary parts: i - 3i = -2i

So, the result of the multiplication is \( 4 - 2i \).

Wait, let me double-check that. So, \( a = \sqrt{2} \), \( b = -3\sqrt{2} \). So, \( a \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}/2 = 2/2 = 1 \). Correct.

\( a \times i\sqrt{2}/2 = \sqrt{2} \times i\sqrt{2}/2 = i \times 2/2 = i \). Correct.

\( bi \times \sqrt{2}/2 = (-3\sqrt{2})i \times \sqrt{2}/2 = (-3 \times 2)/2 i = -3i \). Correct.

\( bi \times i\sqrt{2}/2 = (-3\sqrt{2})i \times i\sqrt{2}/2 = (-3\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2})/2 \times i^2 = (-3 \times 2)/2 \times (-1) = (-6)/2 \times (-1) = 3 \). Correct.

So, adding up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i. Yes, that's correct.

So, after multiplying \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} \), we get \( 4 - 2i \).

Now, the last step is to add \( c \) back to this result to get \( w \). So:

\( w = c + (4 - 2i) \)

Given that \( c = 2 - 3i \), let's compute this:

\( w = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = (2 + 4) + (-3i - 2i) = 6 - 5i \)

Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. \( 2 + 4 = 6 \), and \( -3i - 2i = -5i \). So, yes, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the multiplication step. Because sometimes when dealing with complex numbers, it's easy to mix up signs or coefficients.

So, let's go back to the multiplication:

\( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Let me compute each term again:

First term: \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second term: \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Third term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2} i = -3i \)

Fourth term: \( -3\sqrt{2}i \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2} i^2 = -3 \times (-1) = 3 \)

Adding them up: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i. Yep, that's correct.

So, adding \( c = 2 - 3i \) to this gives:

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \). So, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, but let me think again. Is this correct? Because sometimes when you rotate, especially with complex numbers, it's easy to make a mistake in the direction or the angle.

Wait, the rotation is counterclockwise by \( \pi/4 \). So, the formula is correct because \( e^{i\theta} \) gives a counterclockwise rotation. So, that's fine.

Alternatively, maybe I can represent \( z \) and \( c \) as vectors and perform the rotation using vector rotation formulas.

Let me try that approach to verify.

Expressing \( z \) and \( c \) as vectors in the plane:

\( z = (2 + \sqrt{2}, -3 - 3\sqrt{2}) \)

\( c = (2, -3) \)

So, the vector from \( c \) to \( z \) is \( z - c = (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \). That's the same as before.

Now, to rotate this vector by \( \pi/4 \) counterclockwise, the rotation matrix is:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \]

Where \( \theta = \pi/4 \). So, plugging in:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \]

Multiplying this matrix by the vector \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \):

First component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{3 \times 2}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

Second component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{2}{2} + (-\frac{3 \times 2}{2}) = 1 - 3 = -2 \)

So, the rotated vector is \( (4, -2) \). Adding this back to \( c = (2, -3) \):

\( (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5) \)

Which corresponds to the complex number \( 6 - 5i \). So, that's consistent with my earlier result.

Therefore, I think \( w = 6 - 5i \) is correct.

But just to be thorough, let me compute it another way. Maybe using the formula for rotation in complex numbers.

The formula is:

\[ w = c + (z - c) \times e^{i\theta} \]

Which is exactly what I did earlier. So, I think that's solid.

Alternatively, I can represent \( z - c \) as a complex number and multiply by \( e^{i\pi/4} \).

Given \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \), which can be written as \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \).

Multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

So,

\( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Factor out \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \). So, the multiplication becomes:

\( 1 \times (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \)

Wait, because \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2}/2 (1 + i) \), so when multiplied by \( \sqrt{2} \), it becomes \( (1 + i) \).

So, \( (1 - 3i)(1 + i) \). Let's compute that:

First, multiply 1 by (1 + i): 1 + i

Then, multiply -3i by (1 + i): -3i - 3i^2 = -3i + 3 (since \( i^2 = -1 \))

Adding together: 1 + i - 3i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (i - 3i) = 4 - 2i

So, same result as before. Therefore, \( w = c + (4 - 2i) = 2 - 3i + 4 - 2i = 6 - 5i \).

Alright, so all methods lead me to the same answer. I think I can confidently say that \( w = 6 - 5i \).

**Final Answer**
The complex number \( w \) is \boxed{6 - 5i}.

To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) becomes the origin**:

"To simplify the square root of 242, I start by factoring 242 into its prime components. I recognize that 242 divided by 2 equals 121, and 121 is 11 squared. This means 242 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 11 squared.

Next, I apply the property of square roots that allows me to separate the factors under the square root. This gives me the square root of 2 multiplied by the square root of 11 squared. Since the square root of 11 squared is simply 11, I can simplify the expression further.

Finally, I combine the results to obtain the simplified form of the square root of 242, which is 11 times the square root of 2.

To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), follow these steps:

1. **Factor 242 into its prime components:**
   
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]
   
   Since \(121 = 11^2\), we can rewrite 242 as:
   
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11^2
   \]

2. **Apply the square root to each factor:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}
   \]
   
   Using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we get:
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2}
   \]

3. **Simplify the square root of the perfect square:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{11^2} = 11
   \]
   
   Therefore:
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = 11 \times \sqrt{2}

Problém spočívá v určení minimálního počtu stupňů, o který musí být pravidelný pětiúhelník otočen proti směru hodinových ručiček kolem svého středu, aby se shodoval se svou původní polohou.

**Řešení:**

1. **Výpočet centrálního úhlu pětiúhelníka:**
   - Pravidelný pětiúhelník má 5 stejných stran a 5 stejných úhly.
   - Celkem kolem středu pětiúhelníka je 360 stupňů.
   - Centrální úhel pro každý vrchol je tedy:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

"Okay, so I have this problem here about a right-angled triangle ABC with a right angle at B. The question says that sin A equals 2 times cos A, and I need to find the value of tan A. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the sine and cosine of an angle are related to the sides of the triangle. Specifically, for angle A, sin A is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, and cos A is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. So, if I let the sides opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse to angle A be a, b, and c respectively, then:

sin A = a/c
cos A = b/c

The problem states that sin A = 2 cos A. So, substituting the expressions I have:

a/c = 2*(b/c)

Hmm, okay, so if I multiply both sides by c to eliminate the denominators, I get:

a = 2b

That means the side opposite angle A is twice as long as the side adjacent to angle A. Interesting. So, in triangle ABC, side a is twice side b.

Now, I need to find tan A. I remember that tan A is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side, so:

tan A = a/b

But from earlier, I found that a = 2b. So substituting that into the equation:

tan A = (2b)/b

Simplifying that, the b's cancel out:

tan A = 2

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting again, sin A = 2 cos A. So, using the definitions:

a/c = 2*(b/c)

Multiply both sides by c:

a = 2b

Then tan A = a/b = 2b/b = 2. Yep, that seems correct.

Alternatively, I can think about this using trigonometric identities. I know that tan A = sin A / cos A. Since sin A = 2 cos A, substituting that into tan A:

tan A = (2 cos A) / cos A = 2

So, that also gives me tan A = 2. That confirms my earlier result.

Just to be thorough, maybe I can use the Pythagorean identity. I know that sin² A + cos² A = 1. Given that sin A = 2 cos A, I can substitute:

(2 cos A)² + cos² A = 1
4 cos² A + cos² A = 1
5 cos² A = 1
cos² A = 1/5
cos A = ±√(1/5)

But since we're dealing with a right-angled triangle, all sides are positive, so cos A is positive. Therefore, cos A = √(1/5) = (√5)/5.

Then, sin A = 2 cos A = 2*(√5)/5 = (2√5)/5.

Now, tan A = sin A / cos A = [(2√5)/5] / [(√5)/5] = (2√5)/5 * 5/√5 = 2.

So, again, I get tan A = 2. That seems consistent across different methods. I think I'm confident that the answer is 2.

Just to visualize, if angle A has opposite side 2 and adjacent side 1, then the hypotenuse would be √(1² + 2²) = √5. So, sin A = 2/√5, cos A = 1/√5, and tan A = 2/1 = 2. Yep, that all checks out.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The key was recognizing that sin A = 2 cos A implies a relationship between the sides, which directly gives the tangent as 2. Alternatively, using trigonometric identities also leads to the same conclusion. So, I'm pretty sure the answer is 2.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\tan A$ is \boxed{2}.
</think>

In a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we are given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

First, we use the definitions of sine and cosine in a right-angled triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{a}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{b}{c}
\]
where \(a\) is the side opposite angle \(A\), \(b\) is the side adjacent to angle \(A\), and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.

Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we substitute the expressions:
\[
\frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(c\) gives:
\[
a = 2b
\]

Next, we use the definition of tangent:
\[
\tan A = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Substituting \(a = 2b\) into the equation:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2b}{b} = 2
\]

We can also verify this using trigonometric identities. Since \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\) and given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we have:
\[
\tan A = \frac{2 \cos A}{\cos A} = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this function here: f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). The problem is asking me to find the vertical asymptotes, which are at x = a and x = b, and the horizontal asymptote, which is y = c. Then, I need to add them all together to get a + b + c. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this step by step.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is a quadratic: x² - 5x - 14. Let me try to factor that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be 2 and -7 because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Perfect! So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). That means the function can be rewritten as f(x) = (2x)/[(x + 2)(x - 7)]. 

So, the denominator is zero when x + 2 = 0 or x - 7 = 0, which gives x = -2 and x = 7. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7. 

Now, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. I recall that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 (since it's 2x) and the degree of the denominator is 2 (since it's a quadratic). 

When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they were equal, it would be the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree was higher, there wouldn't be a horizontal asymptote (but maybe an oblique one). 

In this case, since 1 < 2, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.

Now, I need to add a, b, and c together. So, a is -2, b is 7, and c is 0. Let me compute that: -2 + 7 + 0. That equals 5. 

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Factoring the denominator: x² -5x -14. Yes, (x + 2)(x - 7) is correct because (x + 2)(x - 7) = x² -7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. So that's right.

For the horizontal asymptote, since the numerator's degree is less than the denominator's, it's y = 0. That seems correct too. So, adding them up: -2 + 7 is 5, plus 0 is still 5. 

I think that's all. So, the final answer should be 5.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{5}.
</think>

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7) \]

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which gives \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). Therefore, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

For the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( c = 0 \).

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \]

The value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for any two-dimensional vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, or the induced norm, is the smallest such \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). So, I think I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.

Let me recall, the operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is defined as

\[
\|A\| = \sup_{\mathbf{v} \neq 0} \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}
\]

So, essentially, I need to find the maximum value of \( \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \) over all non-zero vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). This maximum value will be the smallest \( C \) that satisfies the given inequality.

Now, how do I compute this operator norm? I think for a matrix, the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm (which is the standard vector norm here) is equal to the largest singular value of the matrix. So, I need to find the singular values of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

Singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). So, first, I should compute \( A^T A \).

Let me compute \( A^T \) first. The transpose of \( A \) is:

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, multiplying \( A^T \) and \( A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me perform the multiplication step by step.

First row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 2 \times 2 + 0 \times 0 = 4 + 0 = 4 \)

First row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 2 \times 3 + 0 \times (-2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 3 \times 2 + (-2) \times 0 = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 3 \times 3 + (-2) \times (-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So, putting it all together, \( A^T A \) is:

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix because the singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues.

To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

So, let's compute the determinant:

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - (6)(6)
\]

Calculating this:

First, expand \( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) \):

\( 4 \times 13 = 52 \)

\( 4 \times (-\lambda) = -4\lambda \)

\( (-\lambda) \times 13 = -13\lambda \)

\( (-\lambda) \times (-\lambda) = \lambda^2 \)

So, \( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 \)

Now, subtract \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \):

So, the determinant is \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 52 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 \)

Therefore, the characteristic equation is:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Let me solve this quadratic equation for \( \lambda \).

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, the two eigenvalues are:

1. \( \lambda = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( \lambda = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. Hence, the singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these, which are 4 and 1.

Since the operator norm is the largest singular value, the operator norm \( \|A\| \) is 4. Therefore, the smallest \( C \) satisfying the inequality is 4.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, computing \( A^T A \):

- First element: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4
- First row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6
- Second row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6
- Second row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13

Yes, that seems correct.

Then, the determinant calculation:

\( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 \)

Expanding:

\( 4*13 = 52 \)

\( 4*(-\lambda) = -4\lambda \)

\( (-\lambda)*13 = -13\lambda \)

\( (-\lambda)*(-\lambda) = \lambda^2 \)

So, \( \lambda^2 -17\lambda +52 -36 = \lambda^2 -17\lambda +16 \). Correct.

Solving quadratic equation:

Discriminant: \( 289 - 64 = 225 \), square root is 15.

So, \( \lambda = (17 +15)/2 = 16 \) and \( (17 -15)/2 = 1 \). Correct.

Singular values are 4 and 1. So, the operator norm is 4.

Alternatively, another way to compute the operator norm is to consider that for a 2x2 matrix, the operator norm can also be found by maximizing \( \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \) over all unit vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). Maybe I can try this approach as a verification.

Let me denote \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), with \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

Then, \( A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ 0x -2y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \).

The norm squared of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is:

\( (2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \).

We need to maximize this expression subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

So, the problem reduces to maximizing \( 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \) with \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

This is a constrained optimization problem. I can use Lagrange multipliers.

Let me set up the Lagrangian:

\( L(x, y, \lambda) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 - \lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 1) \)

Taking partial derivatives:

1. \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = 8x + 12y - 2\lambda x = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} = 12x + 26y - 2\lambda y = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \lambda} = -(x^2 + y^2 - 1) = 0 \)

So, from the first equation:

\( 8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \) => \( (8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0 \) --- (1)

From the second equation:

\( 12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \) => \( 12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0 \) --- (2)

We have two equations:

(1): \( (8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0 \)

(2): \( 12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0 \)

This is a homogeneous system, so for non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

So, the determinant of the matrix:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\
12 & 26 - 2\lambda
\end{pmatrix}
\]

must be zero.

Calculating the determinant:

\( (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - (12)(12) = 0 \)

Let me compute this:

First, expand \( (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) \):

\( 8*26 = 208 \)

\( 8*(-2\lambda) = -16\lambda \)

\( (-2\lambda)*26 = -52\lambda \)

\( (-2\lambda)*(-2\lambda) = 4\lambda^2 \)

So, \( (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) = 4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 208 \)

Subtracting \( 12*12 = 144 \):

\( 4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 208 - 144 = 4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 64 = 0 \)

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \)

Wait, this is the same quadratic equation as before! So, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1, which are the same as before. Therefore, the maximum value of \( \|A\mathbf{v}\|^2 \) is 16, so the maximum \( \|A\mathbf{v}\| \) is 4. Therefore, the operator norm is indeed 4.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is using the fact that for any matrix, the operator norm is equal to the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which we already found to be 16, so the square root is 4.

Just to make sure, let me test with a specific vector. Suppose I take the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 16 in \( A^T A \). Let me find that eigenvector.

For \( \lambda = 16 \), we have:

\( (A^T A - 16I)\mathbf{v} = 0 \)

So,

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 - 16 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - 16 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 & 6 \\ 6 & -3 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, the equations are:

1. \( -12x + 6y = 0 \) => \( -12x + 6y = 0 \) => \( -2x + y = 0 \) => \( y = 2x \)
2. \( 6x - 3y = 0 \) => \( 6x - 3y = 0 \) => \( 2x - y = 0 \) => \( y = 2x \)

So, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of \( \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \). Let's take \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \). Its norm is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{5} \).

"Okay, so I have this math problem here: What is \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\)? Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that exponents can sometimes be tricky, especially when they're stacked like that. But let's break it down step by step.

First, I know that any number raised to the power of 1 is just itself. So, \(1\) raised to any exponent should still be \(1\), right? But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The exponent here is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a massive number. But does that matter? Because regardless of how big the exponent is, if the base is 1, the result should always be 1.

Let me recall the exponentiation rules. The general rule is \(a^b = a\) multiplied by itself \(b\) times. So, if \(a = 1\), then no matter how many times you multiply 1 by itself, it's still 1. For example, \(1^2 = 1 \times 1 = 1\), \(1^3 = 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1\), and so on. So, even if the exponent is a huge number like \(2^{235423523}\), multiplying 1 by itself that many times would still result in 1.

Wait, but maybe I should consider if there's any exception or special case here. I know that \(0^0\) is undefined, but that's not the case here. Here, the base is 1, not 0, so that shouldn't be a problem. Also, negative exponents would result in reciprocals, but since the exponent is positive, that's not an issue either.

Another thing to think about is if the exponent is a complex number or something, but in this case, it's just a positive integer exponent. So, no, that doesn't complicate things here.

Let me also think about logarithms, just to see if that gives me any insight. The logarithm of 1 is 0, regardless of the base, because any number to the power of 0 is 1. But in this case, we're dealing with 1 raised to a power, not the logarithm of 1. So, maybe that's not directly helpful, but it reinforces the idea that 1 to any power is 1.

I guess another way to look at it is through the properties of exponents. For any real number \(a\), \(a^0 = 1\), and \(1^b = 1\) for any \(b\). So, since the base is 1, the exponent doesn't affect the outcome. It doesn't matter if the exponent is 2, 100, or even a gigantic number like \(2^{235423523}\); the result is still going to be 1.

Is there any mathematical principle or theorem that specifically addresses this? I think it's just a basic property of exponents. Specifically, for any integer \(n\), \(1^n = 1\). This is because multiplying 1 by itself any number of times doesn't change its value. So, even if \(n\) is an extremely large number, the result remains 1.

I wonder if there's a way to express \(2^{235423523}\) in a different form, but I don't think that's necessary here. The key point is that the base is 1, so regardless of the exponent, the result is 1. It's not like we're dealing with a variable or an unknown; it's a straightforward calculation.

Let me also consider if there's any trick or a common mistake people make with exponents. Sometimes, people confuse the order of operations, like thinking \(1^2^{235423523}\) is different from \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), but in reality, exponentiation is right-associative, meaning it's evaluated from the top down. So, \(1^{2^{235423523}}\) is the same as \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), which is still 1.

Another thought: sometimes, in more advanced math, especially in modular arithmetic or other contexts, exponents can have different behaviors, but in standard arithmetic, 1 raised to any power is always 1. So, unless specified otherwise, we can safely assume we're working within the realm of standard arithmetic here.

I also remember that in limits and calculus, sometimes expressions can approach certain values, but again, this is a finite exponent, so limits aren't a concern here. It's just a straightforward exponentiation.

To sum up, no matter how I approach this, whether through basic exponent rules, properties of 1, or considering different mathematical contexts, the result is consistently 1. The exponent, although extremely large, doesn't affect the outcome because the base is 1.

So, after all this thinking, I'm pretty confident that \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\) is equal to 1.

The expression \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\) simplifies to 1 because any number raised to any power remains 1 if the base is 1.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) where \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that complex numbers satisfying \( z^n = 1 \) are called the nth roots of unity. In this case, since \( z^5 = 1 \), \( z \) is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). I also recall that these roots can be expressed in the form \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). But since \( z \neq 1 \), we're looking at the roots where \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

So, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) where \( k \) is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Now, I need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Let me see if I can express this in terms of trigonometric functions because I know that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), so \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). Therefore, \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2\cos\theta \) and similarly, \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = 2\cos(2\theta) \).

So, substituting \( \theta = \frac{2\pi k}{5} \), the expression becomes \( 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \). Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to \( 2\left[ \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \right] \).

Now, I need to compute this sum of cosines. Let me recall some trigonometric identities. There's a formula for the sum of cosines: \( \cos A + \cos B = 2\cos\left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right)\cos\left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right) \). Let me apply this identity to \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi k}{5}\right) + \cos\left(\frac{4\pi k}{5}\right) \).

Let me set \( A = \frac{4\pi k}{5} \) and \( B = \frac{2\pi k}{5} \). Then, \( \frac{A + B}{2} = \frac{6\pi k}{10} = \frac{3\pi k}{5} \) and \( \frac{A - B}{2} = \frac{2\pi k}{10} = \frac{\pi k}{5} \). So, the sum becomes \( 2\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right) \).

Therefore, the original expression is \( 2 \times 2\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right) = 4\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right) \).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the minimal polynomial for \( z \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). That's because \( z^5 - 1 = (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \), so if \( z \neq 1 \), then \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

So, \( z^4 = - (z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) \). Maybe I can use this to express higher powers of \( z \) in terms of lower ones. Let me see if that helps.

Looking back at the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \), I can note that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \) implies \( z^{-1} = z^{4} \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^{3} \). So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

\( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

So, the expression simplifies to \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \). But from the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we know that \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is equal to \( -1 \).

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, is the answer just \( -1 \)? Let me verify that.

Given that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), then \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The sum \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \) is indeed equal to \( -1 \) because the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero, and subtracting 1 (the root \( z = 1 \)) gives \( -1 \).

Therefore, substituting \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \), the expression becomes \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1 \).

So, the value is \( -1 \).

Alternatively, going back to the trigonometric approach, I had \( 4\cos\left( \frac{\pi k}{5} \right)\cos\left( \frac{3\pi k}{5} \right) \). Let me compute this for \( k = 1 \). Then, \( \cos\left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \) is approximately 0.8090, and \( \cos\left( \frac{3\pi}{5} \right) \) is approximately -0.3090. Multiplying these gives approximately -0.2487, and multiplying by 4 gives approximately -0.9948, which is roughly -1. So, that seems consistent.

Similarly, for \( k = 2 \), \( \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \) is approximately 0.3090, and \( \cos\left( \frac{6\pi}{5} \right) \) is approximately -0.8090. Multiplying these gives approximately -0.2487, and multiplying by 4 gives approximately -0.9948, again roughly -1.

So, both approaches lead me to the conclusion that the expression equals -1.

Therefore, the answer is \( \boxed{-1} \).

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to compute the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, excluding 1. The 5th roots of unity satisfy the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We can express \( \frac{1}{z} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} \) in terms of powers of \( z \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3
\]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we know that:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1

"Okay, so I have this problem about a cylindrical tank being filled with water. The rate at which it's being filled is given as 20π cubic meters per hour. As the tank fills up, the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. I need to find the radius of the tank in meters and express it in the simplest radical form. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the tank is being filled with water, the volume of water is increasing over time, and this is related to the rate at which the water level rises.

The problem gives me two rates: the rate at which the volume is increasing (20π m³/h) and the rate at which the height is increasing (4 m/h). I think I can relate these two rates using calculus, specifically related rates. 

Let me denote the volume as V and the height as h. Then, the volume of water in the tank at any time t is V = πr²h. Since the radius of the tank doesn't change as it's being filled, r is a constant. So, if I take the derivative of both sides with respect to time t, I can relate the rates of change.

Taking the derivative, dV/dt = πr² dh/dt. I know dV/dt is 20π m³/h and dh/dt is 4 m/h. Plugging these values into the equation:

20π = πr² * 4

Hmm, let me write that out:

20π = πr² * 4

I can simplify this equation. First, I notice that π appears on both sides, so I can divide both sides by π to cancel it out:

20 = r² * 4

Now, I can solve for r² by dividing both sides by 4:

r² = 20 / 4
r² = 5

So, to find r, I take the square root of both sides:

r = √5

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started with the volume formula for a cylinder: V = πr²h.
2. Took the derivative with respect to time: dV/dt = πr² dh/dt.
3. Plugged in the given rates: 20π = πr² * 4.
4. Divided both sides by π: 20 = 4r².
5. Divided both sides by 4: r² = 5.
6. Took the square root: r = √5.

Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, the radius of the tank is √5 meters.

Just to make sure, let me think about the units. The volume rate is in cubic meters per hour, and the height rate is in meters per hour. When I divide dV/dt by dh/dt, I should get an area, which is consistent with πr². So, 20π / 4 = 5π, which would be the area. Then, solving for r gives √(5π / π) = √5. Yep, that makes sense.

I think I'm confident with this answer. The radius is √5 meters.

**Final Answer**

The problem involves a cylindrical tank being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, with the water level rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. To find the radius of the tank, we use the volume formula for a cylinder and related rates.

1. The volume of a cylinder is given by \(V = \pi r^2 h\).
2. Taking the derivative with respect to time \(t\), we get \(\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}\).
3. Substituting the given rates: \(20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4\).
4. Simplifying by dividing both sides by \(\pi\): \(20 = 4r^2\).
5. Solving for \(r^2\): \(r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5\).
6. Taking the square root: \(r = \sqrt{5}\).

So, the function is made up of two parts: a quadratic on the right and a linear on the left, meeting at x = a.

I need to ensure that for every y, there's an x such that f(x) = y. So, the function must cover all possible y-values. Let me analyze both pieces.

First, let's consider the quadratic part: f(x) = ax² for x ≥ a. The range of this part depends on the value of a. If a is positive, then as x increases, ax² goes to infinity. If a is negative, ax² goes to negative infinity as x increases. Similarly, for the linear part: f(x) = ax + 2a for x < a. The range here is all real numbers if a is not zero, but let's see.

Wait, actually, for the linear part, if a is positive, as x approaches negative infinity, ax + 2a approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches a from the left, it approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. Similarly, if a is negative, as x approaches negative infinity, ax + 2a approaches positive infinity, and as x approaches a from the left, it approaches a² + 2a.

So, the linear part can cover a range from either negative infinity to a² + 2a (if a > 0) or from positive infinity to a² + 2a (if a < 0). The quadratic part, on the other hand, for x ≥ a, if a > 0, it goes from a*a = a² upwards to infinity. If a < 0, it goes from a*a = a² downwards to negative infinity.

So, to have the entire function cover all y-values, the ranges of the two pieces must overlap or connect in such a way that there are no gaps. Let's consider different cases for a.

Case 1: a > 0.

In this case, the linear part (x < a) goes from negative infinity up to a² + 2a. The quadratic part (x ≥ a) starts at a² and goes to infinity. So, for the function to cover all y-values, the maximum of the linear part (which is a² + 2a) must be greater than or equal to the minimum of the quadratic part (which is a²). So, a² + 2a ≥ a². Simplifying, 2a ≥ 0, which is true since a > 0. So, in this case, the linear part goes up to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part starts at a². So, the function's range is (-∞, a² + 2a] union [a², ∞). But wait, that would mean the function's range is (-∞, ∞) only if a² + 2a is greater than or equal to a², which it is, but actually, the linear part goes up to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part starts at a². So, if a² + 2a is greater than a², which it is, then the function's range is (-∞, ∞) only if a² + 2a is greater than or equal to a², which is always true, but wait, no. Because the linear part goes up to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part starts at a². So, if a² + 2a is greater than a², which it is, then the function's range is (-∞, a² + 2a] union [a², ∞). But wait, that would leave a gap between a² + 2a and a²? No, because a² + 2a is greater than a² when a > 0. So, actually, the linear part goes up to a higher value than the quadratic part starts. So, the function's range is (-∞, a² + 2a] union [a², ∞). But since a² + 2a > a², the union is (-∞, ∞). So, for a > 0, the function is surjective. But wait, is that true?

Wait, let me check. If a > 0, the linear part goes from -∞ to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part goes from a² to ∞. So, the overlap is from a² to a² + 2a. So, the function's range is (-∞, ∞) because the linear part covers up to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part covers from a² onwards. So, together, they cover everything. So, for a > 0, the function is surjective.

But wait, let me test with a specific value. Let's say a = 1. Then, f(x) is x² for x ≥ 1, and x + 2 for x < 1. The linear part goes from -∞ to 1 + 2 = 3, and the quadratic part starts at 1² = 1 and goes to ∞. So, the function's range is (-∞, 3] union [1, ∞), which is (-∞, ∞). So, yes, it's surjective.

Similarly, if a = 2, the linear part goes up to 4 + 4 = 8, and the quadratic part starts at 4. So, the function's range is (-∞, 8] union [4, ∞), which is (-∞, ∞). So, it's surjective.

Wait, but what if a is very large? Let's say a approaches infinity. Then, the linear part goes up to a² + 2a, which is very large, and the quadratic part starts at a². So, the function's range is still (-∞, ∞). So, for any a > 0, the function is surjective.

But wait, the question is asking for the largest value of a such that the graph intersects every horizontal line at least once. So, if a can be any positive number, then the largest a would be infinity, but that doesn't make sense because a is a real number. So, maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider the case when a is negative. Let's see.

Case 2: a < 0.

In this case, the linear part (x < a) is f(x) = ax + 2a. Since a is negative, the slope is negative. As x approaches negative infinity, ax + 2a approaches positive infinity (because a is negative, so ax becomes positive and large). As x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. The quadratic part (x ≥ a) is f(x) = ax². Since a is negative, this is a downward-opening parabola. As x increases, ax² goes to negative infinity. At x = a, f(a) = a*(a)² = a³.

So, the linear part goes from positive infinity down to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part goes from a³ down to negative infinity. So, the function's range is (-∞, a³] union [a² + 2a, ∞). But for the function to be surjective, the ranges must cover all real numbers. So, we need (-∞, a³] union [a² + 2a, ∞) to be equal to (-∞, ∞). That requires that a³ ≤ a² + 2a. Because otherwise, there would be a gap between a³ and a² + 2a.

So, let's set up the inequality: a³ ≤ a² + 2a.

Let's rearrange: a³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0.

Factor: a(a² - a - 2) ≤ 0.

Factor the quadratic: a² - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1).

So, the inequality becomes a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0.

We need to find the values of a where this product is less than or equal to zero.

Let's consider the critical points: a = -1, 0, 2.

We can make a sign chart:

- For a < -1: Let's pick a = -2. Then, (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = (-2)(4) = -8 ≤ 0. So, satisfies.

- For -1 < a < 0: Let's pick a = -0.5. Then, (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = (-0.5)(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

- For 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1. Then, (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 ≤ 0. Satisfies.

- For a > 2: Let's pick a = 3. Then, (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

At the critical points:

- a = -1: (-1)(-1 - 2)(-1 + 1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0. So, satisfies.

- a = 0: 0*(...)=0. Satisfies.

- a = 2: 2*(2 - 2)*(2 + 1) = 2*0*3=0. Satisfies.

So, the inequality a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0 holds for a ≤ -1, 0 ≤ a ≤ 2.

But in this case, we're considering a < 0, so the relevant interval is a ≤ -1.

So, for a < 0, the function is surjective only if a ≤ -1.

Wait, but let's check with a specific value. Let's take a = -1.

Then, f(x) is -x² for x ≥ -1, and -x + 2*(-1) = -x - 2 for x < -1.

The linear part (x < -1): f(x) = -x - 2. As x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches ∞. As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -(-1) - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1.

The quadratic part (x ≥ -1): f(x) = -x². At x = -1, f(-1) = -1. As x increases, f(x) decreases to -∞.

So, the function's range is (-∞, -1] union [-1, ∞). Wait, that's (-∞, ∞). So, it's surjective.

Similarly, if a = -2, let's see.

Linear part: f(x) = -2x + 2*(-2) = -2x -4 for x < -2.

As x approaches -∞, f(x) approaches ∞. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches -2*(-2) -4 = 4 -4 = 0.

Quadratic part: f(x) = -2x² for x ≥ -2. At x = -2, f(-2) = -2*(4) = -8. As x increases, f(x) decreases to -∞.

So, the function's range is (-∞, -8] union [0, ∞). Wait, that's not covering all y-values. There's a gap between -8 and 0. So, the function is not surjective for a = -2.

Wait, that contradicts our earlier conclusion. So, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, when a = -2, the linear part goes from ∞ down to 0, and the quadratic part goes from -8 down to -∞. So, the function's range is (-∞, -8] union [0, ∞). So, there's a gap between -8 and 0. So, the function is not surjective. So, a = -2 doesn't work.

But according to our inequality, a ≤ -1 should satisfy the condition. But in reality, a = -1 works, but a = -2 doesn't. So, perhaps the condition is not just a ≤ -1, but something else.

Wait, let's go back. The inequality was a³ ≤ a² + 2a, which simplifies to a³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0, which factors to a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0.

So, for a < 0, the inequality holds when a ≤ -1. But in reality, when a = -1, it works, but when a < -1, it doesn't. So, perhaps the condition is a ≤ -1, but only a = -1 works? Or maybe I need to check the exact point where the ranges meet.

Wait, when a = -1, the linear part goes from ∞ down to -1, and the quadratic part goes from -1 down to -∞. So, the function's range is (-∞, -1] union [-1, ∞), which is all real numbers. So, it's surjective.

But when a < -1, say a = -2, the linear part goes from ∞ down to 0, and the quadratic part goes from -8 down to -∞. So, the function's range is (-∞, -8] union [0, ∞), which is not all real numbers. So, there's a gap between -8 and 0.

So, the function is surjective only when a = -1. Because for a < -1, the linear part's lower bound is higher than the quadratic part's upper bound, creating a gap. So, the only a < 0 for which the function is surjective is a = -1.

Wait, but let's check a = -0.5, which is between -1 and 0. According to the inequality, a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0, for a = -0.5,","[-0.500000000000000, '-0.5']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is \( (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \), where \( (h, k) \) is the center and \( r \) is the radius. So, I need to rewrite the given equation into this standard form by completing the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

Let me group the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms together:
\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0 \]

Now, I'll complete the square for the \( x \) terms. The coefficient of \( x \) is -10. To complete the square, I take half of -10, which is -5, and then square it to get 25. So, I add and subtract 25 inside the equation.

Similarly, for the \( y \) terms, the coefficient is 6. Half of 6 is 3, and squaring that gives 9. So, I add and subtract 9 for the \( y \) terms.

Let me write that out:
\[ (x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9) + c = 0 \]

Simplifying this, it becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constants:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \]

Wait, that doesn't look right. Let me check my steps again. When I complete the square, I added 25 and 9 inside the equation, so I need to subtract them to keep the equation balanced. So, the equation should be:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Which simplifies to:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \]

Hmm, actually, I think I made a mistake in the sign. Let me re-express it correctly. The original equation is:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
After completing the square:
\[ (x^2 - 10x + 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9) = -c + 25 + 9 \]
So, that becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = -c + 34 \]

Ah, yes, that's better. So, the standard form is:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Now, in the standard form, the right-hand side is \( r^2 \). We are told that the radius \( r \) is 1, so \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Solving for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ c = 33 \]

Wait, let me double-check. If \( c = 33 \), then the equation becomes:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - 33 = 1 \]
Which is indeed a circle with radius 1. So, that seems correct.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in completing the square, let me go through that part again.

Starting with \( x^2 - 10x \). Completing the square:
Take half of -10, which is -5, square it to get 25. So, \( x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).

For \( y^2 + 6y \), half of 6 is 3, square it to get 9. So, \( y^2 + 6y = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

Putting it all back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine constants:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0 \]
Which rearranges to:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Yes, that's correct. So, setting \( 34 - c = 1 \) gives \( c = 33 \). I think that's solid.

Just to recap, the steps were:
1. Start with the given equation.
2. Group \( x \) and \( y \) terms.
3. Complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \).
4. Rewrite the equation in standard circle form.
5. Set the right-hand side equal to \( r^2 \) where \( r = 1 \).
6. Solve for \( c \).

Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my calculations, so I'm confident that \( c = 33 \) is the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( c \) is \boxed{33}.
</think>

To find the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we start by rewriting the equation in standard form by completing the square.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

We group the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms together:
\[ (x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms:
- For \( x^2 - 10x \), we add and subtract 25: \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \)
- For \( y^2 + 6y \), we add and subtract 9: \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \)

Rewriting the equation with these completed squares:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combining the constants:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

Rearranging to the standard form of a circle's equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

We know the radius \( r \) is 1, so \( r^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Solving for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \boxed{33}.","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The parameter λ controls the behavior of the function. For different values of λ, the function can have fixed points, periodic points, and so on.

The problem is asking for λ values where there's a point x that isn't a fixed point (so f(x) ≠ x), but when you apply f twice, you get back to x. In other words, x is a periodic point of period 2. So, I need to find λ such that f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x.

Let me write down the equations. First, f(x) = λx(1 - x). Then, f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let me compute that:

f(f(x)) = f(λx(1 - x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

We need f(f(x)) = x, so:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me rearrange this equation:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, the solutions are either x = 0 or the term in the brackets equals zero:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

But we are looking for x ≠ 0 because if x = 0, then f(0) = 0, so f(f(0)) = 0, which would mean f(f(0)) = 0 = x, but x is 0, so that's a fixed point. Similarly, x = 1 would also be a fixed point because f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0, which is not equal to 1 unless λ = 0, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.

So, focusing on the non-zero solutions, we have:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me expand this expression step by step.

First, compute (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)):

(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) = (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2).

Let me multiply this out:

= 1*(1 - λx + λx^2) - x*(1 - λx + λx^2)
= 1 - λx + λx^2 - x + λx^2 - λx^3
= 1 - (λ + 1)x + (λ + λ)x^2 - λx^3
= 1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3.

So, substituting back into the equation:

λ^2 [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3] - 1 = 0.

Let me distribute λ^2:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3 x^2 - λ^3 x^3 - 1 = 0.

Now, let's write this as a polynomial in x:

-λ^3 x^3 + 2λ^3 x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

So, the equation is:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Hmm, this is a cubic equation in x. We can factor this equation to find solutions.

Let me see if I can factor this cubic. Maybe factor by grouping.

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2) + (λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1)) = 0.

Factor out λ^3 x^2 from the first group:

λ^3 x^2(x - 2) + [λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1)] = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe try to factor the entire cubic.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out (x - something). Let me try to see if x = 1 is a root.

Plug x = 1 into the cubic:

λ^3(1)^3 - 2λ^3(1)^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)(1) - (λ^2 - 1)
= λ^3 - 2λ^3 + λ^3 + λ^2 - λ^2 + 1
= (λ^3 - 2λ^3 + λ^3) + (λ^2 - λ^2) + 1
= 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0.

So, x = 1 is not a root.

How about x = 0? Plugging x = 0:

0 - 0 + 0 - (λ^2 - 1) = -(λ^2 - 1). So, if λ^2 - 1 = 0, i.e., λ = 1 or λ = -1, but λ is between 0 and 4, so λ = 1. So, x = 0 is a root only when λ = 1. But we already considered x = 0 earlier, which is a fixed point.

Alternatively, maybe x = something else. Let me think.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor the cubic as (x - a)(quadratic). Let me attempt to factor it.

Let me denote the cubic as:

A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D = 0,

where A = λ^3,

B = -2λ^3,

C = λ^2(λ + 1),

D = -(λ^2 - 1).

So, A = λ^3,

B = -2λ^3,

C = λ^3 + λ^2,

D = -λ^2 + 1.

We can try to factor this as (x - a)(E x^2 + F x + G) = 0.

Multiplying out:

x*(E x^2 + F x + G) - a*(E x^2 + F x + G) =

E x^3 + F x^2 + G x - a E x^2 - a F x - a G =

E x^3 + (F - a E) x^2 + (G - a F) x - a G.

Set this equal to the original cubic:

E x^3 + (F - a E) x^2 + (G - a F) x - a G = λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + (λ^3 + λ^2) x - (λ^2 - 1).

So, equate coefficients:

1. E = λ^3,

2. F - a E = -2λ^3,

3. G - a F = λ^3 + λ^2,

4. -a G = - (λ^2 - 1).

From equation 4: -a G = - (λ^2 - 1) => a G = λ^2 - 1.

From equation 1: E = λ^3.

From equation 2: F - a E = -2λ^3 => F = a E - 2λ^3 = a λ^3 - 2λ^3.

From equation 3: G - a F = λ^3 + λ^2.

But from equation 4: G = (λ^2 - 1)/a.

So, substitute G into equation 3:

(λ^2 - 1)/a - a F = λ^3 + λ^2.

But F = a λ^3 - 2λ^3, so:

(λ^2 - 1)/a - a (a λ^3 - 2λ^3) = λ^3 + λ^2.

Simplify:

(λ^2 - 1)/a - a^2 λ^3 + 2 a λ^3 = λ^3 + λ^2.

Let me write this as:

(λ^2 - 1)/a + (2 a λ^3 - a^2 λ^3) = λ^3 + λ^2.

Factor λ^3 from the second term:

(λ^2 - 1)/a + λ^3 (2a - a^2) = λ^3 + λ^2.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe I should try a specific value for a. Let me see if a is a simple function of λ.

Alternatively, perhaps a is 1 or something. Let me test a = 1.

If a = 1, then from equation 4: G = λ^2 - 1.

From equation 2: F = λ^3 - 2λ^3 = -λ^3.

From equation 3: G - a F = (λ^2 - 1) - (-λ^3) = λ^2 - 1 + λ^3.

But equation 3 should equal λ^3 + λ^2, so:

λ^2 - 1 + λ^3 = λ^3 + λ^2 => -1 = 0, which is not true. So, a ≠ 1.

How about a = λ? Let's try a = λ.

From equation 4: G = (λ^2 - 1)/λ.

From equation 2: F = λ * λ^3 - 2λ^3 = λ^4 - 2λ^3.

From equation 3: G - a F = (λ^2 - 1)/λ - λ*(λ^4 - 2λ^3) = (λ^2 - 1)/λ - (λ^5 - 2λ^4).

But equation 3 should equal λ^3 + λ^2. Let's compute:

(λ^2 - 1)/λ - λ^5 + 2λ^4 = (λ - 1/λ) - λ^5 + 2λ^4.

This doesn't seem to simplify to λ^3 + λ^2. So, a = λ is not working.

Maybe a = something else. Alternatively, perhaps this approach is too cumbersome. Maybe I should instead consider that the equation f(f(x)) = x includes all fixed points of f, so to find points of period 2, we need to exclude the fixed points.

So, fixed points satisfy f(x) = x, which is:

λx(1 - x) = x.

So, x(λ(1 - x) - 1) = 0.

Thus, x = 0 or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0 => λ - λx - 1 = 0 => λx = λ - 1 => x = (λ - 1)/λ, provided λ ≠ 0.

So, fixed points are x = 0 and x = (λ - 1)/λ.

Therefore, to find period-2 points, we need solutions to f(f(x)) = x excluding x = 0 and x = (λ - 1)/λ.

So, the cubic equation we had earlier will have roots at x = 0, x = (λ - 1)/λ, and another root which is the period-2 point.

Therefore, the cubic can be factored as x(x - (λ - 1)/λ)(something) = 0.

Wait, but earlier when I tried to factor, I didn't get that. Maybe I made a mistake.

Alternatively, perhaps the cubic equation can be written as (x - 0)(x - (λ - 1)/λ)(quadratic) = 0.

But let me think differently. Since f(f(x)) = x includes all fixed points, the equation f(f(x)) = x is equivalent to f(f(x)) - x = 0, which factors as (f(x) - x)(something) = 0.

Yes, that's a better approach. Because f(f(x)) - x can be factored as (f(x) - x)(f(f(x)) + x + f(x)) or something? Wait, no, more accurately, f(f(x)) - x = (f(x) - x)(f(f(x)) + x + f(x))? Hmm, not exactly.

Wait, actually, f(f(x)) - x can be factored as (f(x) - x)(f(f(x)) + x + f(x)) only if f(f(x)) + x + f(x) is a factor, but I don't think that's the case.

Alternatively, perhaps f(f(x)) - x = (f(x) - x)(something). Let me check.

Let me denote y = f(x). Then f(f(x)) = f(y). So, f(f(x)) - x = f(y) - x.

But f(y) = λ y (1 - y) = λ f(x) (1 - f(x)).

So, f(f(x)) - x = λ f(x)(1 - f(x)) - x.

But f(x) = λ x (1 - x). So, substituting:

f(f(x)) - x = λ [λ x (1 - x)] [1 - λ x (1 - x)] - x.

Which is the same as the expression we had earlier.

But perhaps we can factor f(f(x)) - x as (f(x) - x)(something). Let me try.

Let me write f(f(x)) - x = (f(x) - x) * Q(x), where Q(x) is some quadratic.

So, let me compute (f(x) - x) * Q(x) = f(f(x)) - x.

We know f(x) - x = λ x (1 - x) - x = x (λ (1 - x) - 1) = x (λ - λ x - 1).

So, f(x) - x = x (λ","[1, '1).\n']","(3,4]",[],False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive angle θ in degrees such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The fraction has a numerator and a denominator, both of which are combinations of sine and cosine terms with different angles. Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify it using some trigonometric identities.

Let me write down the given expression:

tan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]

Alright, so both the numerator and the denominator have four terms each. I notice that in the numerator, there are products of cosines and sines with angles that add up to 25°, 55°, etc. Maybe I can use the cosine addition formula here. The formula is cos(A ± B) = cosA cosB ∓ sinA sinB. Let me see if I can group the terms accordingly.

Looking at the numerator:

cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20° + cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50°

Wait, that's actually two separate cosine addition formulas. The first two terms are cos(5° + 20°) because cosA cosB - sinA sinB = cos(A + B). Similarly, the next two terms are cos(35° + 50°). So let me compute those:

cos(5° + 20°) = cos25°
cos(35° + 50°) = cos85°

So the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°. Okay, that's simpler.

Now, the denominator:

sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20° - sin35° cos50° - cos35° sin50°

Hmm, this also looks like sine addition formulas. The formula is sin(A + B) = sinA cosB + cosA sinB. So the first two terms are sin(5° + 20°) = sin25°, and the next two terms are -[sin35° cos50° + cos35° sin50°] which is -sin(35° + 50°) = -sin85°. So the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°.

So now, the expression becomes:

tan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]

Alright, so now I have tan θ expressed in terms of cosines and sines of 25° and 85°. Maybe I can use sum-to-product identities here. Let me recall those:

For cosines: cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]
For sines: sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]

Let me apply these identities to both the numerator and the denominator.

Starting with the numerator: cos25° + cos85°

Using the identity, this becomes 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°). Since cosine is even, cos(-30°) = cos30°, so numerator is 2 cos55° cos30°.

Now the denominator: sin25° - sin85°

Using the identity, this becomes 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°). Since sine is odd, sin(-30°) = -sin30°, so denominator is 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°.

So now, the expression becomes:

tan θ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°]

I can cancel out the 2 cos55° terms from numerator and denominator, as long as cos55° ≠ 0, which it isn't because 55° is not 90° or 270°, so that's fine.

So we have:

tan θ = [cos30°] / [-sin30°] = - [cos30° / sin30°]

I know that cos30° is √3/2 and sin30° is 1/2, so:

tan θ = - [ (√3/2) / (1/2) ] = -√3

So tan θ = -√3. Hmm, but θ is supposed to be the smallest positive angle. The tangent function is periodic with period 180°, so the solutions for tan θ = -√3 are θ = -60° + 180°k, where k is an integer.

But since we need the smallest positive angle, let's find the equivalent positive angle. If θ = -60°, adding 180° gives θ = 120°, which is positive. So θ = 120° is the smallest positive angle where tan θ = -√3.

Wait, but let me double-check. Is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because tan 120° is indeed tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So yes, that's correct.

But hold on, the problem says ""nejmenší kladný úhel"", which is the smallest positive angle. So 120° is the answer. But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in simplifying.

Let me recap:

1. I used the cosine addition formula on the numerator, breaking it into cos25° + cos85°.
2. Then, I used the sum-to-product identity on cos25° + cos85°, which gave me 2 cos55° cos30°.
3. For the denominator, I used the sine addition formula on sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20°, which is sin25°, and similarly for the other two terms, which became -sin85°.
4. Then, using the sine subtraction identity, I got 2 cos55° sin(-30°), which simplified to -2 cos55° sin30°.
5. Then, I canceled out the 2 cos55° terms, resulting in -cos30° / sin30°, which is -√3.
6. So tan θ = -√3, leading to θ = 120°.

Wait, but is there a smaller positive angle? Because tangent has a period of 180°, so the general solution is θ = -60° + 180°k. The smallest positive angle would be when k=1, so θ = 120°, as I thought.

Alternatively, if I think about the unit circle, tan θ = -√3 occurs in the second and fourth quadrants. The reference angle is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. Since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, 120° is smaller than 300°, so 120° is indeed the answer.

Just to make sure, let me compute tan120°:

tan120° = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3, which matches our earlier result.

So, I think I did everything correctly. The key steps were recognizing the sum and difference identities in both numerator and denominator, simplifying them using sum-to-product formulas, and then reducing the expression to a simple tangent value. Then, using the unit circle to find the smallest positive angle.

I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, so I feel confident that θ is 120 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest positive angle θ is \boxed{120} degrees.
</think>

To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) in degrees such that

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying both the numerator and the denominator using trigonometric identities.

For the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
we use the cosine addition formula:
\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B.
\]
This gives:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

For the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
we use the sine addition formula:
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]
This gives:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use sum-to-product identities:
- For the numerator: \(\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ\).
- For the denominator: \(\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ\).

Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(120^\circ\) because \(\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is \(\boxed{120}\) degrees.","[120, '120']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",True

"Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem with two variables. I remember that to find maxima or minima, I can use calculus, specifically finding partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can simplify or analyze the function a bit.

First, let me note the domain: \( x \) and \( y \) are each in the interval [-1, 1]. So, both \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are real numbers because the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative. That makes sense.

Looking at the function, it's symmetric in a way. If I swap \( x \) and \( y \), the function remains the same. So, maybe the maximum occurs when \( x = y \)? That might be a good starting point. Let me test that idea.

If \( x = y \), then the function becomes:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
So, now I have a single-variable function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). I can find its maximum by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

Let me compute the derivative \( g'(x) \):
First, write \( g(x) = 2x (1 - x^2)^{1/2} \).
Using the product rule:
\[
g'(x) = 2(1 - x^2)^{1/2} + 2x \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x)
\]
Simplify each term:
First term: \( 2(1 - x^2)^{1/2} \)
Second term: \( 2x \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot (-2x) (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} = -2x^2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \)
So, combining:
\[
g'(x) = 2(1 - x^2)^{1/2} - 2x^2 (1 - x^2)^{-1/2}
\]
Factor out \( 2(1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \):
\[
g'(x) = 2(1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \left[ (1 - x^2) - x^2 \right] = 2(1 - x^2)^{-1/2} (1 - 2x^2)
\]
Set \( g'(x) = 0 \):
The denominator \( (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \) is never zero, so set the numerator equal to zero:
\[
1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Since we're looking for the maximum, and \( g(x) \) is positive when \( x \) is positive and negative when \( x \) is negative, the maximum occurs at \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Compute \( g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \):
\[
g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1
\]
So, when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1. Hmm, that's a candidate for maximum.

But wait, I assumed \( x = y \). Maybe the maximum occurs when \( x \neq y \). I shouldn't limit myself to that case. Let me try using calculus for the original function.

Compute the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \).

First, \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

Partial derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x) = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Similarly, partial derivative with respect to \( y \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - y^2)^{-1/2}(-2y) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]
To find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero.

So, we have the system of equations:
1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \)

Let me write these as:
1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Hmm, interesting. Let me denote equation 1 as:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \quad (1)
\]
And equation 2 as:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \quad (2)
\]
If I multiply equation (1) and equation (2) together, I get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \cdot \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}}
\]
So, left side is \( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} \), right side is \( \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}} \).

Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
Expand the left side:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
Subtract \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]
So, the critical points lie on the unit circle. That's a useful condition.

Now, let's go back to equation (1):
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Square both sides to eliminate the square roots:
\[
1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
But we already know from earlier that \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), so \( 1 - x^2 = y^2 \) and \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \). Let me substitute these into the equation.

Left side:
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
But \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \) and \( 1 - x^2 = y^2 \), so:
\[
x^2 \cdot y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
Which is an identity, so it doesn't give us new information. Hmm, so maybe I need another approach.

Let me express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) from equation (1). From equation (1):
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Square both sides:
\[
1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
Again, same as before. Maybe I can use \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) to express one variable in terms of the other.

Let me let \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \). Then, \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) or \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). But since we're looking for maximum, and the function is symmetric, let's consider \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

Wait, but if \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), then \( y \) is non-negative. Similarly, \( x \) can be positive or negative. Let me assume \( x \) and \( y \) are positive because the function is symmetric and the maximum is likely to occur in the positive quadrant.

So, let me set \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Then, substitute into equation (1):
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{x y}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
But \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), so \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \), so \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \). Therefore, left side is \( \sqrt{x^2} = |x| = x \) (since \( x \) is positive).

Right side: \( \frac{x y}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{x \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = x \).

So, both sides equal \( x \). So, this doesn't give any new information. Hmm, seems like I'm going in circles.

Maybe I need to consider the ratio of the partial derivatives. Let me take equation (1) and equation (2):

From equation (1):
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \quad (1)
\]
From equation (2):
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \quad (2)
\]
Let me divide equation (1) by equation (2):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}}{\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}} = \frac{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
So, the ratio is 1, which tells me that \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} / \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} / \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), which is trivially true. So, again, not helpful.

Perhaps I can express \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) from equation (1) and plug into equation (2). From equation (1):
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Plug this into equation (2):
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{xy}{\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
Which again is an identity. Hmm, so maybe the only condition is \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). So, all critical points lie on the unit circle.

But then, how do I find specific points? Maybe I can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) using trigonometric functions since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Let me set \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \), where \( \theta \) is in [0, π/2] since we're considering positive \( x \) and \( y \).

Then, substitute into \( f(x, y) \):
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}
\]
Simplify the square roots:
\[
\sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta
\]
So, the function becomes:
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cdot \cos \theta + \sin \theta \cdot \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]
Wait, that's interesting. So, on the unit circle, the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1. But earlier, when I set \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), which is on the","[sqrt(2)/2, '\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}']",1,"[1, '1']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, I remember that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found using the cross product. Let me think about how that works.

First, I recall that the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors OA and OB. So, the formula should be something like (1/2) times the magnitude of OA cross OB. That makes sense because the cross product gives a vector perpendicular to both OA and OB, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB. So, half of that would be the area of the triangle.

Alright, so I need to compute the cross product of OA and OB. Let me write down the vectors:

OA = (1, 2, 3)
OB = (-3, -2, 1)

The cross product OA × OB can be calculated using the determinant of a matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of OA in the second row, and the components of OB in the third row. So, setting that up:

i  j  k
1  2  3
-3 -2 1

Calculating the determinant, it should be:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3))

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i component: 2*1 is 2, and 3*(-2) is -6. So, 2 - (-6) is 2 + 6, which is 8. So, the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component: The formula has a negative sign in front. Inside the determinant, it's 1*1 - 3*(-3). 1*1 is 1, and 3*(-3) is -9. So, 1 - (-9) is 1 + 9, which is 10. But since there's a negative sign, it becomes -10j.

Now, the k component: 1*(-2) is -2, and 2*(-3) is -6. So, -2 - (-6) is -2 + 6, which is 4. So, the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Wait, let me double-check that. For the j component, I think I might have messed up the sign. The formula is i*(OA_y * OB_z - OA_z * OB_y) - j*(OA_x * OB_z - OA_z * OB_x) + k*(OA_x * OB_y - OA_y * OB_x). So, plugging in the values:

i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) = i*(2 + 6) = 8i

-j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) = -j*(1 + 9) = -10j

k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3)) = k*(-2 + 6) = 4k

Yes, that seems correct. So, OA × OB = (8, -10, 4).

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So:

|OA × OB| = sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2) = sqrt(64 + 100 + 16)

Calculating each term:

8^2 = 64

(-10)^2 = 100

4^2 = 16

Adding them up: 64 + 100 = 164, and 164 + 16 = 180.

So, |OA × OB| = sqrt(180). Hmm, sqrt(180) can be simplified. Let me see, 180 is 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). So, the magnitude is 6√5.

Therefore, the area of triangle OAB is half of this, which is (1/2)*6√5 = 3√5.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the cross product:

OA × OB:

i component: (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8

j component: -[(1)(1) - (3)(-3)] = -[1 + 9] = -10

k component: (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4

Yes, that's correct. Then the magnitude squared is 8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2 = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. So sqrt(180) is indeed 6√5. Then half of that is 3√5.

So, the area of triangle OAB is 3√5.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, I can confidently say the area is 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) with given vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, we compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Calculating each component:

- The \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- The \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \)
- The \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half of this magnitude:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a complex number \( z \) such that

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

And I need to find

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}.
\]

Hmm, alright. Let me think about how to approach this. I remember that expressions like \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since \( z \) is a complex number, it might be helpful to express it in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number can be written as \( z = e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). If I do that, then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), so

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta.
\]

So, in this case, we have

\[
2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Let me solve for \( \cos\theta \):

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Wait, is that right? Let me double-check. If \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \), then yes, that's correct. So,

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Hmm, okay. So \( \theta \) is the angle whose cosine is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Let me compute that value numerically to get a sense of what \( \theta \) is. Let's calculate \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \).

First, \( \sqrt{5} \) is approximately 2.236, so \( 1 + \sqrt{5} \) is about 3.236. Dividing that by 4 gives approximately 0.809. So, \( \cos\theta \approx 0.809 \). That means \( \theta \) is approximately 36 degrees because \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is about 0.809. Let me confirm that: yes, \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is indeed \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, let me think again.

Wait, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). That would be \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), which is approximately \( \frac{2.236 + 1}{2} = 1.618/2 = 0.809 \). So yes, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), which is 0.809. So, \( \theta = 36^\circ \) or \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) radians.

So, \( z = e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/5} \). Therefore, \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \). Wait, 85 divided by 5 is 17, so that's 17π. But \( e^{i17\pi} \) is the same as \( e^{i\pi} \) because \( e^{i2\pi k} = 1 \) for any integer k. So, 17π is 8 full rotations (which is 16π) plus π, so \( e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} = -1 \), and \( 1/z^{85} = 1/(-1) = -1 \). So, \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't skip any steps too quickly. So, if \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \). Since \( e^{i\theta} \) is periodic with period \( 2\pi \), we can subtract multiples of \( 2\pi \) to find an equivalent angle. So, 17π divided by 2π is 8.5, which is 8 full circles plus π. So, \( e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). So, yes, that seems correct.

But wait, is \( z \) necessarily equal to \( e^{i\pi/5} \)? Or could it also be \( e^{-i\pi/5} \)? Because \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \), so \( \theta \) could be positive or negative. So, \( z \) could be \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \). But in either case, raising it to the 85th power would give the same result because \( (e^{-i\pi/5})^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \) as well, since \( e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \). So, regardless of whether \( z \) is \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \), \( z^{85} \) is -1, and so \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, but let me think again. Is 85 the exponent? 85 is a large exponent, but since we're dealing with complex numbers on the unit circle, their powers cycle with period related to their angles. So, if \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^n = e^{in\pi/5} \). So, \( z^{85} = e^{i85\pi/5} = e^{i17\pi} \). As I thought earlier, 17π is an odd multiple of π, so it's equivalent to π in terms of the unit circle, which is -1.

Alternatively, maybe I can use De Moivre's theorem here. Since \( z = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \), then \( z^n = \cos(n\theta) + i\sin(n\theta) \). So, \( z^{85} = \cos(85\theta) + i\sin(85\theta) \), and \( 1/z^{85} = \cos(85\theta) - i\sin(85\theta) \). Therefore, adding them together:

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta).
\]

So, if I can find \( \cos(85\theta) \), then I can find the desired value. Since \( \theta = \pi/5 \), then \( 85\theta = 85 \times \pi/5 = 17\pi \). So, \( \cos(17\pi) = \cos(\pi) = -1 \). Therefore, \( 2\cos(17\pi) = 2 \times (-1) = -2 \). So, that's consistent with my earlier result.

But wait, let me make sure that \( \theta = \pi/5 \) is correct. Because \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, earlier I had \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), so \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me re-examine that step.

Wait, the original equation is \( z + 1/z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). So, if \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \). Therefore,

\[
2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

So, solving for \( \cos\theta \):

\[
\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Wait, that's approximately 0.809, as I thought earlier. So, \( \theta = \arccos\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right) \). But is that equal to \( \pi/5 \)?

Let me compute \( \cos(\pi/5) \). \( \pi/5 \) is 36 degrees, and \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is indeed \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). That would be \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), which is approximately \( \frac{2.236 + 1}{2} = 1.618/2 = 0.809 \). So, yes, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \). Wait, maybe I'm complicating it.

Wait, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). That's \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), which is approximately 1.618/2 = 0.809, which is correct. So, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me just compute \( \cos(\pi/5) \).

Using a calculator, \( \cos(\pi/5) \) is approximately 0.8090, which is equal to \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, actually, \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), which is approximately 1.618/2 = 0.809, which is correct. So, \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, that seems redundant. Let me just accept that \( \cos(\pi/5) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), which is 0.809.

Therefore, \( \theta = \pi/5 \) is correct. So, \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \). Either way, when raised to the 85th power, it becomes \( e^{i17\pi} \) or \( e^{-i17\pi} \), both of which are equal to \( -1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem without using Euler's formula. Maybe using recurrence relations or properties of powers. I remember that for expressions like \( z^n + 1/z^n \), there's a recurrence relation based on \( z + 1/z \). Let me recall that.

If I let \( a_n = z^n + 1/z^n \), then there's a recurrence relation:

\[
a_{n+1} = (z + 1/z) \cdot a_n - a_{n-1}.
\]

So, given \( a_0 = 2 \) (since \( z^0 + 1/z^0 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)), and \( a_1 = z + 1/z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), I can compute \( a_2, a_3, \ldots \) up to \( a_{85} \). But computing up to 85 terms manually would be tedious. Maybe there's a pattern or periodicity.

Alternatively, since \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z + 1/z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), multiplying both sides by \( z \) gives:

\[
z^2 + 1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z.
\]

So,

\[
z^2 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z + 1 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( z \). Let me find its roots. Using the quadratic formula:

\[
z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2}.
\]

Let me compute the discriminant:

\[
\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \","[4, 'z = \\frac{\\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} \\pm \\sqrt{( \\frac{1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2} )^2 - 4}}{2}.']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and the medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. A line passing through G and parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. Since it's parallel to BC, triangle AMN should be similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem. That theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, if MN is parallel to BC, then AM/AB = AN/AC. Let me denote the ratio as k. So, AM = k*AB and AN = k*AC. Since MN is parallel to BC, the triangles AMN and ABC are similar with a similarity ratio of k.

But wait, the line MN passes through the centroid G. So, I need to find the value of k such that the line MN passes through G. Since G is the centroid, it's located at the intersection of the medians, each divided in a 2:1 ratio.

Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the triangle ABC would help. Let me place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). This way, the coordinates are general, and I can compute the centroid G.

The centroid G has coordinates ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3). Simplifying, that's (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3).

Now, the line MN is parallel to BC. Let me find the equation of BC first. Point B is at (2b, 0) and point C is at (2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2(c - b)) = d/(c - b). So, the slope of MN is also d/(c - b) since it's parallel.

But wait, MN passes through G, so I can write the equation of MN using point-slope form. The coordinates of G are (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3). So, the equation is:

y - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - 2(b + c)/3)

Now, I need to find where this line intersects AB and AC. Let's find point M on AB first. AB is from (0,0) to (2b, 0), so it's along the x-axis. The equation of AB is y = 0.

Setting y = 0 in the equation of MN:

0 - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - 2(b + c)/3)

Simplify:

-2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - 2(b + c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:

-2d/3 * (c - b)/d = x - 2(b + c)/3

Simplify:

-2(c - b)/3 = x - 2(b + c)/3

Bring the term on the right to the left:

-2(c - b)/3 + 2(b + c)/3 = x

Combine the terms:

[-2c + 2b + 2b + 2c]/3 = x

Simplify numerator:

(-2c + 2b + 2b + 2c) = 4b

So, x = 4b/3

Therefore, point M is at (4b/3, 0).

Similarly, let's find point N on AC. AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d). The parametric equations for AC can be written as x = 2ct, y = 2dt, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Now, substitute x and y into the equation of MN:

2dt - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2ct - 2(b + c)/3)

Simplify:

2dt - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2ct - 2(b + c)/3)

Divide both sides by d:

2t - 2/3 = (1/(c - b))(2ct - 2(b + c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b):

(2t - 2/3)(c - b) = 2ct - 2(b + c)/3

Expand the left side:

2t(c - b) - (2/3)(c - b) = 2ct - 2(b + c)/3

Simplify:

2tc - 2tb - (2c/3 - 2b/3) = 2ct - 2b/3 - 2c/3

Bring all terms to the left:

2tc - 2tb - 2c/3 + 2b/3 - 2ct + 2b/3 + 2c/3 = 0

Simplify term by term:

2tc - 2ct = 0

-2tb remains

-2c/3 + 2c/3 = 0

2b/3 + 2b/3 = 4b/3

So, we have:

-2tb + 4b/3 = 0

Solve for t:

-2tb + 4b/3 = 0

-2tb = -4b/3

Divide both sides by -2b (assuming b ≠ 0):

t = (4b/3)/(2b) = (4/3)/2 = 2/3

So, t = 2/3. Therefore, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3).

Wait, hold on. That can't be right because AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), so t=2/3 would give (4c/3, 4d/3). But if I plug t=2/3 into the parametric equations, that's correct. Hmm, but let me check the calculation again.

Wait, when I substituted into the equation of MN, I had:

2dt - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2ct - 2(b + c)/3)

Divide both sides by d:

2t - 2/3 = (1/(c - b))(2ct - 2(b + c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b):

(2t - 2/3)(c - b) = 2ct - 2(b + c)/3

Expanding left side:

2t(c - b) - (2/3)(c - b) = 2ct - 2(b + c)/3

So, 2tc - 2tb - 2c/3 + 2b/3 = 2ct - 2b/3 - 2c/3

Subtract 2ct from both sides:

-2tb - 2c/3 + 2b/3 = -2b/3 - 2c/3

Bring all terms to left:

-2tb - 2c/3 + 2b/3 + 2b/3 + 2c/3 = 0

Simplify:

-2tb + 4b/3 = 0

So, -2tb = -4b/3 => t = (4b/3)/(2b) = 2/3. So, t=2/3 is correct.

Therefore, point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3). Wait, but AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), so t=2/3 would be (4c/3, 4d/3). That seems correct.

So, points M and N are at (4b/3, 0) and (4c/3, 4d/3) respectively.

Now, I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, but wait, the problem mentions points E and F as medians. Let me recall that in triangle ABC, the medians are AD, BE, and CF. So, E is the midpoint of AC, and F is the midpoint of AB.

So, point E is the midpoint of AC. Since AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), the midpoint E is at ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d).

Similarly, point F is the midpoint of AB, which is from (0,0) to (2b, 0), so F is at ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0).

But wait, the problem is about triangle ENG. So, points E, N, and G.

Point E is (c, d), point N is (4c/3, 4d/3), and point G is (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3).

So, I need to find the area of triangle ENG with these three points.

To find the area, I can use the shoelace formula.

First, let me write down the coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3)

Let me denote them as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3):

x1 = c, y1 = d

x2 = 4c/3, y2 = 4d/3

x3 = 2(b + c)/3, y3 = 2d/3

The shoelace formula is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plugging in the values:

Area = |(c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) + (2(b + c)/3)*(d - 4d/3))/2|

Simplify each term:

First term: c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2cd)/3

Second term: (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = (-4cd)/9

Third term: (2(b + c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = (2(b + c)/3)*(-d/3) = (-2(b + c)d)/9

So, putting it all together:

Area = |( (2cd)/3 + (-4cd)/9 + (-2(b + c)d)/9 ) / 2|

Combine the terms:

Convert all to ninths:

(2cd)/3 = 6cd/9

So, 6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - 2(b + c)d/9 = (6cd - 4cd - 2(b + c)d)/9 = (2cd - 2(b + c)d)/9

Factor out 2d:

2d(c - (b + c))/9 = 2d(-b)/9 = (-2bd)/9

Take absolute value and divide by 2:

| (-2bd/9 ) / 2 | = | (-2bd)/18 | = | -bd/9 | = bd/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is bd/9.

But wait, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC? Using coordinates, the area can be found via shoelace as well.

Points A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d).

Area ABC = |(0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0))/2| = |0 + 4bd + 0| / 2 = |4bd| / 2 = 2|bd|

Given that area ABC is 144, so 2|bd| = 144 => |bd| = 72.

Therefore, bd = ±72, but since area is positive, we can say bd = 72.

So, the area of triangle ENG is bd/9 = 72/9 = 8.

Wait, so the area is 8? Hmm, that seems small, but let me verify.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the shoelace formula. Let me double-check.

Compute the area of triangle ENG:

E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), G(2(b + c)/3, 2d/3)

Using shoelace:

Arrange the points:

E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), G(2(b + c)/3, 2d/3), back to E(c, d)

Compute the sum of x_i y_{i+1}:

c*(4d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3) + (2(b + c)/3)*d

= (4cd)/3 + (8cd)/9 + (2(b + c)d)/3

Convert to ninths:

= (12cd)/9 + (8cd)/9 + (6(b + c)d)/9

= (12cd + 8cd + 6bd + 6cd)/9

= (26cd + 6bd)/9

Sum of y_i x_{i+1}:

d*(4c/3) + (4d/3)*(2(b + c)/3) + (2d/3)*c

= (4cd)/3 + (8d(b + c))/9 + (2cd)/3

Convert to ninths:

= (12cd)/9 + (8bd + 8cd)/9 + (6cd)/9

= (12cd + 8bd + 8cd + 6cd)/9

= (26cd + 8bd)/9

Now, subtract the two sums:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of sines at various angles: sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, and sin160°. That's eight sine terms multiplied together. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula I can use to simplify this.

First, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities. But with eight terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that products of sines at equally spaced angles can sometimes be expressed in terms of multiple angles or using complex numbers. Let me think about that.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. These angles are all multiples of 20°, right? So, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. That's 20° times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, it's like 20° times k, where k goes from 1 to 8. Interesting.

Wait, so maybe I can write this product as the product of sin(20°k) for k from 1 to 8. So, that's sin20°, sin40°, ..., sin160°. Hmm, I wonder if there's a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles.

I remember that for n angles, the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1 is equal to sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. But in this case, the angles are in degrees, not radians, and they're not exactly of the form kπ/(2n). Let me check.

Wait, 20° is π/9 radians, right? Because 180° is π radians, so 20° is π/9. So, 20°, 40°, ..., 160° correspond to π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9. So, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) ... sin(8π/9). Hmm, that's interesting.

I think there's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/n) for k from 1 to n-1. Let me recall. I think it's something like n/(2^{n-1}). Wait, is that right? Let me check for a small n.

For example, when n=3, the product sin(π/3) sin(2π/3). Sin(π/3) is sqrt(3)/2, sin(2π/3) is also sqrt(3)/2. So, the product is 3/4. And n/(2^{n-1}) would be 3/(2^2) = 3/4. So that works. Similarly, for n=4, the product sin(π/4) sin(2π/4) sin(3π/4). Sin(π/4)=sqrt(2)/2, sin(2π/4)=1, sin(3π/4)=sqrt(2)/2. So, the product is (sqrt(2)/2)*1*(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/4) = 1/2. And n/(2^{n-1}) is 4/(2^3)=4/8=1/2. So that works too.

So, in general, the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). So, in this case, n=9, because the angles are multiples of π/9. So, the product sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) ... sin(8π/9) should be 9/(2^8) = 9/256.

Wait, but hold on. The formula is for k=1 to n-1, which in this case is 8 terms, which is exactly what we have here. So, the product is 9/256. But wait, let me confirm.

Wait, in the formula, is it n/(2^{n-1}) or something else? Let me check for n=5. The product sin(π/5) sin(2π/5) sin(3π/5) sin(4π/5). Let's compute it numerically.

Sin(π/5) ≈ 0.5878, sin(2π/5) ≈ 0.9511, sin(3π/5)=sin(2π/5)≈0.9511, sin(4π/5)=sin(π/5)≈0.5878. So, the product is approximately 0.5878 * 0.9511 * 0.9511 * 0.5878. Let me compute that:

First, 0.5878 * 0.5878 ≈ 0.3455, and 0.9511 * 0.9511 ≈ 0.9046. Then, 0.3455 * 0.9046 ≈ 0.3125. Now, n=5, so n/(2^{n-1})=5/16≈0.3125. So, that matches. So, the formula seems correct.

Therefore, for n=9, the product sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) ... sin(8π/9) is 9/(2^8)=9/256. So, that's 9/256.

But wait, in our problem, the angles are in degrees, but we converted them to radians as π/9, 2π/9, etc. So, the product is indeed 9/256. So, is that the answer? Wait, but let me make sure.

Wait, in the formula, the product is for k=1 to n-1 of sin(kπ/n). So, in our case, n=9, so k=1 to 8, which is exactly our case. So, yes, the product is 9/256.

But wait, let me think again. The formula is for sin(kπ/n), but in our problem, the angles are 20°, 40°, ..., 160°, which are π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9. So, exactly the same as the formula. So, the product is 9/256.

But wait, let me compute 9/256. 256 divided by 9 is approximately 28.444, so 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625. Let me check if that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the product numerically to verify. Let me compute each sine term:

sin20° ≈ 0.3420

sin40° ≈ 0.6428

sin60° ≈ 0.8660

sin80° ≈ 0.9848

sin100° ≈ 0.9848

sin120° ≈ 0.8660

sin140° ≈ 0.6428

sin160° ≈ 0.3420

So, multiplying all these together:

0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198

0.2198 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1903

0.1903 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1878

0.1878 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1853

0.1853 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1606

0.1606 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.1033

0.1033 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0353

So, the approximate product is about 0.0353, which is roughly 9/256≈0.03515625. So, that seems to match. So, the exact value is 9/256.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula gives the product as n/(2^{n-1}), which for n=9 is 9/256. So, that's the exact value.

But wait, let me make sure that the formula applies here. The formula is for the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1, which is exactly our case. So, yes, the product is 9/256.

Therefore, the answer is 9/256.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any chance that the formula is different? Because sometimes, depending on the source, the formula might have a square root or something else. Let me check.

Wait, I think the formula is indeed n/(2^{n-1}) for the product of sin(kπ/n) from k=1 to n-1. So, for n=3, it's 3/4, which is correct. For n=4, it's 4/8=1/2, which is correct. For n=5, it's 5/16≈0.3125, which matches our earlier calculation. So, for n=9, it's 9/256.

Therefore, the product is 9/256.

Wait, but let me think about another approach to confirm. Maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity.

I remember that the product of sines can be related to the roots of unity. Specifically, the product of (z - e^{iθ}) for θ = 2πk/n for k=0 to n-1 is z^n - 1. But how does that relate to the product of sines?

Alternatively, I recall that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using the identity that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). So, that's the formula.

Therefore, in our case, n=9, so the product is 9/(2^8)=9/256.

So, I think that's the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using the identity for multiple angles.

I know that sin(nθ) can be expressed as a product involving sines of θ, but I'm not sure if that helps here.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for the product of sines in arithmetic progression.

Wait, I found a formula online before that the product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/n) = n/(2^{n-1}). So, that's consistent.

Therefore, I think the answer is 9/256.

Wait, but let me compute 9/256. 256 divided by 9 is approximately 28.444, so 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625, which matches our earlier approximate calculation of 0.0353. So, that seems correct.

Therefore, the exact value is 9/256.

So, I think that's the answer.
</think>

The product of the sines can be found using the formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles. The angles given are multiples of 20°, which correspond to π/9 radians. The product of sin(kπ/9) for k from 1 to 8 is given by the formula n/(2^{n-1}) where n=9. Therefore, the product is 9/256.

"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out what shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates. The options are a line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point in space is defined by these three components.

The equation given is \( z = c \). That means, for any point on this surface, the z-coordinate is fixed at the constant value \( c \). I need to visualize what this looks like in 3D space.

In Cartesian coordinates, if I have \( z = c \), that's a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But since we're in cylindrical coordinates, I should think about how this translates. In cylindrical, \( z \) is still the vertical coordinate, so setting it equal to a constant should still represent a plane, right?

Wait, but let me make sure. In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary freely as long as \( z \) is fixed. So, for any \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z = c \), the point lies on this surface. That means it's not just a line or a circle because those would restrict either \( r \) or \( \theta \) or both. Instead, it's a flat surface extending infinitely in the radial and angular directions but fixed in height.

So, in Cartesian terms, this is a plane. But let me check the options again: (A) Přímka (line), (B) Kružnice (circle), (C) Rovinná plocha (plane), (D) Koule (sphere), (E) Válec (cylinder), (F) Kužel (cone). So, the correct term here is ""Rovinná plocha,"" which is option (C).

Wait, but just to be thorough, could it be a cylinder? A cylinder in cylindrical coordinates is usually represented by \( r = c \), which is a fixed radius, creating a cylindrical surface around the z-axis. Since our equation is \( z = c \), that's different. It's not constraining the radius or the angle, just the height. So, it's definitely a plane, not a cylinder.

Similarly, a cone would involve a relationship between \( r \) and \( z \), like \( z = kr \) for some constant \( k \). A sphere would involve all three coordinates, something like \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \). A line would require more constraints, like both \( r \) and \( \theta \) being fixed, but here only \( z \) is fixed. A circle would fix both \( r \) and \( z \), but here \( r \) can vary.

So, yeah, I'm pretty confident it's a plane. So, the answer should be (C).
</think>

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane because it fixes the height \( z \) while allowing \( r \) and \( \theta \) to vary freely. This corresponds to a flat, horizontal surface in 3D space.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is (3, 2, 6). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors a and b is given by the formula:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin{\theta} \mathbf{n}
\]

where θ is the angle between them and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both a and b. The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by a and b, which is also equal to \(\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin{\theta}\).

So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can set it equal to \(\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin{\theta}\) and solve for sinθ, then find θ.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector (3, 2, 6). The magnitude is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Okay, so the magnitude of the cross product is 7. Now, plugging into the formula:

\[
7 = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin{\theta}
\]

We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), so:

\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin{\theta}
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
7 = 14 \sin{\theta}
\]

Divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

So, sinθ is 1/2. Now, I need to find the angle θ whose sine is 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(150°) = 1/2. Since we're looking for the smallest possible angle between the vectors, it must be 30°, because 30° is smaller than 150°.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cross product magnitude is 7, and the product of the magnitudes of a and b is 14. So, 7 divided by 14 is indeed 1/2. So, sinθ is 1/2, which corresponds to 30° or 150°. Since the angle between two vectors is defined as the smallest angle between them, it should be 30°. That makes sense.

Just to recap:

1. Calculated the magnitude of the cross product: √(9 + 4 + 36) = 7.
2. Set that equal to ||a|| ||b|| sinθ: 7 = 2*7*sinθ.
3. Simplified to find sinθ = 1/2.
4. Determined θ is 30°, the smallest angle.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the smallest angle is 30 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin{\theta}
\]

we substitute the known values:

\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin{\theta}
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin{\theta}
\]

Solving for \(\sin{\theta}\):

\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is either \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we need the smallest angle, we choose \(30^\circ\).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the roots of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The function f(x) is given as f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for any polynomial function, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial like f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, for f(x), the sum of the roots would be -(-49)/1, which is 49. That makes sense.

But wait, the question is about g(x) = f(x + 5). So, g(x) is a transformation of f(x). Specifically, it's a horizontal shift to the left by 5 units. I think that shifting a function horizontally doesn't change the shape of the graph, just its position. But does it affect the roots?

Let me recall. If g(x) = f(x + 5), then the roots of g(x) are the values of x such that f(x + 5) = 0. So, if r is a root of f(x), then x + 5 = r implies x = r - 5. Therefore, each root of g(x) is 5 less than a root of f(x). So, if f(x) has roots r1, r2, r3, then g(x) has roots r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r1 - 5) + (r2 - 5) + (r3 - 5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) - 15. Since the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49, then the sum of the roots of g(x) should be 49 - 15 = 34.

Wait, let me verify that. Alternatively, maybe I can find g(x) explicitly and then use Vieta's formula on it. Let's try that.

Given f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015, then g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, expand (x + 5)³:
(x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, expand -49(x + 5)²:
(x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25, so multiplying by -49 gives -49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, expand 623(x + 5):
623x + 3115.

And the constant term is -2015.

Now, let's add all these together:

Start with the x³ term: x³.

Then the x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².

Next, the x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, plus 623 is 208. So, 208x.

Finally, the constants: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, so g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. So, in standard form, it's x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0.

Now, using Vieta's formula for the sum of roots, which is -b/a, where a is the coefficient of x³ and b is the coefficient of x². Here, a = 1 and b = -34. So, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. That matches my earlier conclusion.

So, whether I think about shifting the roots or compute g(x) explicitly, I get the same result. Therefore, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. Let me just recap:

1. Recognize that g(x) is a horizontal shift of f(x), so each root is shifted left by 5.
2. Therefore, each root of g(x) is 5 less than a root of f(x).
3. Sum of roots of f(x) is 49, so sum of roots of g(x) is 49 - 15 = 34.
4. Alternatively, expand g(x) and use Vieta's formula, which also gives 34.

Yep, that seems consistent. I think I'm confident with that answer.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the roots of \( g \) is \boxed{34}.
</think>

To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we can use the properties of polynomial functions and Vieta's formulas.

First, we note that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formula. For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For \( f(x) \), this sum is \( -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), each root of \( g(x) \) is 5 less than a root of \( f(x) \). Therefore, if the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is then:

\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15
\]

Given that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[
49 - 15 = 34
\]

To verify, we can expand \( g(x) \) explicitly:

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Expanding each term:

1. \( (x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 \)
2. \( -49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225 \)
3. \( 623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115 \)
4. The constant term is \( -2015 \)

Combining all terms:

- \( x^3 \)
- \( 15x^2 - 49x^2 = -34x^2 \)
- \( 75x - 490x + 623x = 208x \)
- Constants: \( 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015 = 0 \)

Thus, \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \). Using Vieta's formula, the sum of the roots is \( -\frac{-34}{1} = 34 \).

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: compute the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that trigonometric identities often help simplify expressions like this. Let me recall some identities that might be useful here. I know that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately, but perhaps I can relate these angles somehow. I notice that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, and 20° is double 10°, and 40° is double 20°. Maybe there's a pattern or a relationship here.

I also remember that \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\) and \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\). Maybe expressing everything in terms of tangent and cotangent could be useful. Let me try that:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Simplifying that, I get:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, so now I have 3 plus some tangent and cotangent squared terms. I wonder if I can find a relationship between these angles. Let me think about the angles: 10°, 20°, and 40°. I know that 10°, 20°, and 40° are related through doubling. 20° is 2*10°, and 40° is 2*20°, so maybe I can use double-angle identities here.

Let me recall the double-angle identity for tangent: \(\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}\). Maybe I can express \(\tan 20^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\), and \(\tan 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 20^\circ\). Let me try that.

First, let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\). Then, \(\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\). Similarly, \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2 \tan 20^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ}\). Let me compute that:

\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \left(\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{4t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \frac{4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}} = \frac{4t}{(1 - t^2) - 4t^2/(1 - t^2)}
\]

Wait, that seems a bit messy. Maybe I can find a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\). Let me think.

I know that \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\), so \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\). So, if I can express \(\tan 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 40^\circ\) in terms of \(t = \tan 10^\circ\), then I can express the cotangents as well.

Let me compute \(\tan 20^\circ\) first:

\[
\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}
\]

So, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1 - t^2}{2t}\).

Similarly, \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2 \tan 20^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ}\). Let me compute that:

\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2 \cdot \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \left(\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\right)^2} = \frac{\frac{4t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \frac{4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}} = \frac{4t}{(1 - t^2) - \frac{4t^2}{1 - t^2}} = \frac{4t}{\frac{(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2}{1 - t^2}} = \frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2}
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2 = 1 - 2t^2 + t^4 - 4t^2 = 1 - 6t^2 + t^4
\]

So, \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}\). Therefore, \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{4t(1 - t^2)}\).

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the original expression again:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

I wonder if I can use some kind of identity that relates these terms. Maybe using the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\) or something similar? Let me recall that \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\). Not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\sin 2\theta = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta\). Let me see if that can help me relate the terms.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, expressions with multiple angles can be simplified by considering them as parts of a triangle or using sum and difference identities. Let me see.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates \(\sin^2 \theta\) and \(\cos^2 \theta\) with double angles. For example, \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2}\) and \(\cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \cos 2\theta}{2}\). Maybe expressing each term in the original expression using these identities could help.

Let me try that:

First term: \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}\)

Second term: \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ}\)

Third term: \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}\)

So, substituting these into the original expression:

\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

Hmm, that seems a bit more manageable. Let me factor out the 2:

\[
2\left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 80^\circ} \right)
\]

Now, I can try to compute each fraction separately. Let me compute each denominator:

First denominator: \(1 + \cos 20^\circ\)

Second denominator: \(1 - \cos 40^\circ\)

Third denominator: \(1 - \cos 80^\circ\)

I remember that \(1 - \cos \theta = 2\sin^2 (\theta/2)\) and \(1 + \cos \theta = 2\cos^2 (\theta/2)\). Let me apply these identities:

First term: \(\frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{2\cos^2 10^\circ}\)

Wait, that's just the original first term. Hmm, that doesn't help. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\cos A + \cos B\) or something similar. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\cos 3\theta\). Let me recall that \(\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta\). Maybe that can help relate the angles 10°, 20°, and 40°, since 3*10°=30°, which is close to 20° and 40°, but not exactly. Hmm.

Wait, another idea: perhaps using the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\) in terms of \(\sin \theta\). Let me recall that \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\). Maybe if I set \(\theta = 10^\circ\), then \(\sin 30^\circ = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ\). Since \(\sin 30^\circ = 0.5\), this gives an equation involving \(\sin 10^\circ\). Maybe I can solve for \(\sin 10^\circ\) or something related.

Let me write that down:

\[
\sin 30^\circ = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ
\]
\[
0.5 = 3\sin 10^\circ - 4\sin^3 10^\circ
\]

Let me denote \(x = \sin 10^\circ\). Then, the equation becomes:

\[
4x^3 - 3x + 0.5 = 0
\]

Hmm, that's a cubic equation. Maybe I can solve it or find some relationship from it. Let me rearrange:

\[
4x^3 - 3x = -0.5
\]

I know that \(4x^3 - 3x\) is actually the expression for \(\sin 3\theta\) when \(\theta = 10^\circ\), which we already used. Not sure if that helps directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a relationship between \(\sin 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ\). Let me think about the product of sines or something.

Wait, another idea: perhaps using the identity for \(\sin A \sin B\). Let me recall that \(\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]\). Maybe that can help me relate the terms.

But in our case, we have reciprocals of squares of sines and cosine. Maybe I can consider the reciprocals as cosecants and secants and use some identities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates \(\csc^2 \theta\) and \(\cot \theta\). I know that \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\), so maybe expressing everything in terms of cotangent could help.

Wait, let me go back to the expression I had earlier:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Maybe I can find a relationship between \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\cot 20^\circ\), and \(\cot 40^\circ\). Let me think about the angles: 10°, 20°, 40°, which are in a geometric progression with ratio 2. Maybe there's a telescoping identity or something.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates \(\cot \theta\) and \(\tan \theta\). For example, \(\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)\). So, \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). So, substituting that in:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, so now I have 3 plus the squares of tangents of 10°, 50°, and 70°. I wonder if there's a known identity for the sum of squares of tangents of these angles.

Wait, I recall that in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180°, but I don't know if that's directly applicable here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity that relates \(\tan A + \tan B + \tan C\) when A + B + C = 180°, but that's for the sum, not the squares.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\). Let me recall that \","[tan(3*theta), '\\tan 3\\theta']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem here: ""Kolik stran by měl konvexní mnohoúhelník, pokud součet všech jeho vnitřních úhlů kromě jednoho je 1070°?"" Which translates to: ""How many sides should a convex polygon have if the sum of all its interior angles except one is 1070°?"" Hmm, interesting. I need to figure out the number of sides, n, of this polygon.

First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2)*180°. That's a standard formula, right? So, if all the interior angles were known, their sum would be (n-2)*180°. But in this case, the sum of all except one angle is 1070°. So, that means one angle is missing from the total sum.

Let me denote the sum of all interior angles as S. So, S = (n-2)*180°. The problem says that S minus one angle is 1070°, so S - x = 1070°, where x is the measure of the missing angle. Therefore, x = S - 1070°. But since it's a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than 180°, right? Because in a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180°, and all exterior angles are positive and add up to 360°.

So, x must be less than 180°. Therefore, S - 1070° < 180°. Let me write that down:

(n - 2)*180° - 1070° < 180°

Simplify this inequality:

(n - 2)*180° < 1070° + 180°
(n - 2)*180° < 1250°

Divide both sides by 180°:

n - 2 < 1250° / 180°
n - 2 < 6.944...

So, n < 8.944. Since n must be an integer (number of sides can't be a fraction), n must be less than or equal to 8.944, so n ≤ 8. But wait, let's think again. Because S is the total sum, and S = (n-2)*180°, and S - x = 1070°, so x = S - 1070°. Since x must be positive (as it's an interior angle), we also have that S > 1070°, so (n-2)*180° > 1070°.

Let me write that:

(n - 2)*180° > 1070°

Divide both sides by 180°:

n - 2 > 1070° / 180°
n - 2 > 5.944...

So, n > 7.944. Therefore, n must be greater than 7.944, so n ≥ 8.

Putting it together, n must be greater than 7.944 and less than 8.944. Since n must be an integer, the only possible value is n = 8.

Wait, but let me verify this. If n = 8, then the total sum S = (8-2)*180° = 6*180° = 1080°. Then, the missing angle x = S - 1070° = 1080° - 1070° = 10°. But wait, 10° is less than 180°, so that's fine for a convex polygon. So, that works.

But hold on, let me check if n could be 9. If n = 9, then S = (9-2)*180° = 7*180° = 1260°. Then, x = 1260° - 1070° = 190°. But 190° is more than 180°, which would make the polygon concave, right? Because in a convex polygon, all interior angles must be less than 180°. So, n can't be 9.

Similarly, if n = 7, then S = (7-2)*180° = 5*180° = 900°. Then, x = 900° - 1070° = negative, which doesn't make sense because angles can't be negative. So, n can't be 7.

Therefore, the only possible value is n = 8. So, the polygon must have 8 sides.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says ""kromě jednoho"" which means ""except one"". So, the sum of all except one is 1070°, which is less than the total sum. So, the total sum must be 1070° plus the missing angle, which is less than 180°, so total sum is less than 1070° + 180° = 1250°. But for n=8, total sum is 1080°, which is less than 1250°, so that's okay. For n=9, total sum is 1260°, which is more than 1250°, so that's not possible because the missing angle would have to be 190°, which is too big.

So, n=8 is the only possible solution.

Wait, but let me check n=7 again. If n=7, total sum is 900°, but the given sum is 1070°, which is more than 900°, so that's impossible because you can't have a sum of angles greater than the total sum. So, n must be at least 8.

Therefore, the answer is 8 sides.
</think>

The polygon must have 8 sides because the sum of the interior angles of an 8-sided polygon is 1080°, and subtracting 10° (which is less than 180°) gives 1070°, satisfying the condition.

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find a unique odd integer t such that 0 < t < 23, and t + 2 is the multiplicative inverse of t modulo 23. Hmm, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's recall what a multiplicative inverse modulo 23 means. If t + 2 is the inverse of t modulo 23, that means when I multiply t by t + 2, the result should be congruent to 1 modulo 23. In other words, t*(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23. So, I can write this as:

t(t + 2) ≡ 1 mod 23

Expanding the left side, that becomes:

t² + 2t ≡ 1 mod 23

Which I can rearrange to form a quadratic congruence:

t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23

So, I need to solve this quadratic equation modulo 23. Let me write it as:

t² + 2t - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23

I remember that solving quadratic congruences can sometimes be done by completing the square or using the quadratic formula, but I need to be careful because modular arithmetic has its own rules. Let me try completing the square here.

Completing the square for t² + 2t. The coefficient of t is 2, so half of that is 1, and squaring it gives 1. So, I can write:

t² + 2t + 1 - 1 - 1 ≡ 0 mod 23

Which simplifies to:

(t + 1)² - 2 ≡ 0 mod 23

So,

(t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23

Now, I need to find integers t such that (t + 1) squared is congruent to 2 modulo 23. In other words, I need to find square roots of 2 modulo 23.

I remember that 23 is a prime number, so the field modulo 23 is a finite field, and in such fields, each element has either 0, 1, or 2 square roots. Since 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 23, it should have two square roots. Let me check if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 23.

Using Euler's criterion, which says that a number a is a quadratic residue modulo a prime p if a^((p-1)/2) ≡ 1 mod p. So, let's compute 2^11 mod 23.

Calculating 2^11: 2^10 is 1024, which is 1024 mod 23. Let me compute 23*44 = 1012, so 1024 - 1012 = 12. So, 2^10 ≡ 12 mod 23. Then, 2^11 = 2^10 * 2 ≡ 12*2 = 24 ≡ 1 mod 23. So, 2 is indeed a quadratic residue modulo 23.

Therefore, there are two solutions for (t + 1)² ≡ 2 mod 23. Let me find these square roots.

I need to find x such that x² ≡ 2 mod 23. Let me test some numbers:

1² = 1 mod 23 → 1
2² = 4 mod 23 → 4
3² = 9 mod 23 → 9
4² = 16 mod 23 → 16
5² = 25 mod 23 → 2
Oh, wait, 5² is 25, which is 2 mod 23. So, x = 5 is a solution. Then, the other solution is x = -5 mod 23, which is 18, because 23 - 5 = 18.

So, the solutions for x = t + 1 are 5 and 18. Therefore, t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 or t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23.

Solving for t:

Case 1: t + 1 ≡ 5 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 4 mod 23
Case 2: t + 1 ≡ 18 mod 23 ⇒ t ≡ 17 mod 23

So, the possible solutions are t = 4 and t = 17. But wait, the problem specifies that t must be an odd integer. Let's check both solutions:

t = 4: 4 is even, so it doesn't satisfy the condition.
t = 17: 17 is odd, so this is a valid solution.

Therefore, the unique odd integer t satisfying the given conditions is 17.

But just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me verify this. Let's compute t + 2 when t = 17: 17 + 2 = 19. Now, check if 19 is the inverse of 17 modulo 23. That means 17*19 should be congruent to 1 mod 23.

Calculating 17*19: 17*20 = 340, subtract 17 gives 323. Now, 323 divided by 23: 23*14 = 322, so 323 - 322 = 1. Therefore, 17*19 ≡ 1 mod 23. Perfect, that checks out.

So, t = 17 is indeed the correct solution.

The unique odd integer t between 0 and 23 such that t + 2 is the multiplicative inverse of t modulo 23 is 17.

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is \(x\). Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the inverse cotangent function, giving me an angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\). 

Wait, I also recall that \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) for positive \(y\). So, if I let \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Is that right? Let me check. If \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Yeah, that seems correct. So, that means \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\).

So, substituting that back into the original equation, the argument inside the sine function becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x)\), which is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the equation simplifies to \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\).

Alright, so now I have \(\sin(2 \theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). I remember the double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\). So, substituting that in, I get \(2 \sin\theta \cos\theta = \frac{1}{3}\).

But I also know that \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so let me think about how to express \(\sin\theta\) and \(\cos\theta\) in terms of \(x\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then in a right triangle, the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore, \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Substituting these into the equation, I get:
\[2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\]
So, that's:
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\]
Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):
\[2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)\]
Which simplifies to:
\[6x = x^2 + 1\]
Bringing all terms to one side:
\[x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\]
This is a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\]
Plugging in the values:
\[x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
Calculating the discriminant:
\[\sqrt{36 - 4} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}\]
So, the solutions are:
\[x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
Simplifying by dividing numerator and denominator by 2:
\[x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\]
So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

Wait, but I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be restrictions on the domain or range.

Let me recall the ranges of the inverse functions. The range of \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\), and the range of \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is \((0, \pi)\). However, since we have \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), which is equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), as I found earlier, so the angle inside the sine function is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). 

The range of \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) would be \((- \pi, \pi)\), but since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is between \(-\frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), multiplying by 2 gives between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\). However, the sine function is periodic with period \(2\pi\), so the equation \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\) has solutions in all intervals where \(\theta\) is such that sine is positive, which is in the first and second quadrants.

But in our case, since \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) can be between \(-\pi\) and \(\pi\), but the sine of that is \(\frac{1}{3}\), which is positive. So, the angle \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) must be in the first or second quadrant, i.e., between 0 and \(\pi\). Therefore, \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) must be between 0 and \(\pi\), which implies that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is between 0 and \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, \(x\) must be positive because \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is positive when \(x > 0\).

Looking at the solutions I found, \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is positive, and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is also positive because \(2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 2.828, so 3 - 2.828 is approximately 0.172, which is still positive. So both solutions are valid in terms of the domain.

Let me verify one of them to be sure. Let's take \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Since \(x\) is positive, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is in the first quadrant. Then, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is also in the first quadrant because \(\frac{1}{x}\) is positive. So, adding two positive angles in the first quadrant, their sum is also in the first or second quadrant. Then, taking the sine of that sum should give a positive value, which is \(\frac{1}{3}\), so that seems consistent.

Similarly, for \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), which is approximately 0.172, positive, so again, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is a small positive angle, and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is a larger positive angle, but their sum is still less than \(\pi\), so the sine should be positive. So, both solutions are valid.

Therefore, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).
</think>

We start with the equation:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We recognize that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, we have:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin\theta \cos\theta\), we substitute \(\sin\theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos\theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\):
\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Rearranging into a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

Both solutions \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are positive, so they are valid.

Thus, the solutions are:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. Both lines are given in parametric form, which is good because I remember that for parallel lines, the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. Let me write down the given information to get a clear picture.

The first line is defined as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, the point on the first line is \( A = (3, -10, 1) \) and the direction vector is \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The second line is defined as:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Here, the point on the second line is \( B = (-5, -3, 6) \) and the direction vector is \( \mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \).

First, I should confirm that these lines are indeed parallel. For two lines to be parallel, their direction vectors must be scalar multiples of each other. Let me check if \( \mathbf{w} \) is a multiple of \( \mathbf{v} \).

Looking at the components:
- The x-component of \( \mathbf{w} \) is 4, which is 2 times the x-component of \( \mathbf{v} \) (which is 2).
- The y-component of \( \mathbf{w} \) is -18, which is 2 times the y-component of \( \mathbf{v} \) (which is -9).
- The z-component of \( \mathbf{w} \) is -4, which is 2 times the z-component of \( \mathbf{v} \) (which is -2).

So, yes, \( \mathbf{w} = 2\mathbf{v} \). That means the direction vectors are scalar multiples, so the lines are parallel. Good, that's confirmed.

Now, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember that the distance can be found by taking the length of the vector that is perpendicular to both lines and connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line. This can be calculated using the formula involving the cross product.

The formula for the distance \( d \) between two parallel lines is:
\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{AB} \cdot (\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w})|}{|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}|}
\]
Wait, actually, since the lines are parallel, \( \mathbf{v} \) and \( \mathbf{w} \) are parallel, so their cross product would be zero. Hmm, that can't be right. Maybe I confused the formula.

Let me think again. Since the lines are parallel, the distance between them is constant, and it can be found by taking the length of the projection of the vector connecting any two points on the lines onto a vector that is perpendicular to the direction of the lines.

Alternatively, another method is to use the formula:
\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{v}|}
\]
Where \( \mathbf{AB} \) is the vector connecting points \( A \) and \( B \) on the two lines, and \( \mathbf{v} \) is the direction vector of the lines.

Yes, that sounds right. Let me verify this formula. The cross product \( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} \) gives a vector whose magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by \( \mathbf{AB} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \). Dividing by the magnitude of \( \mathbf{v} \) gives the height of the parallelogram, which is the distance between the lines. That makes sense.

So, let's compute \( \mathbf{AB} \) first. \( \mathbf{AB} \) is the vector from point \( A \) to point \( B \), so:
\[
\mathbf{AB} = B - A = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Okay, so \( \mathbf{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \).

Next, I need to compute the cross product \( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} \). Let's write down \( \mathbf{v} \) again:
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The cross product is calculated as:
\[
\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) \\ (5)(2) - (-8)(-2) \\ (-8)(-9) - (7)(2) \end{pmatrix}
\]
Let me compute each component step by step.

First component (i-direction):
\[
7 \times (-2) = -14
\]
\[
5 \times (-9) = -45
\]
So, subtracting these: \( -14 - (-45) = -14 + 45 = 31 \)

Second component (j-direction):
Remember, the j-component is negative in the cross product formula.
\[
5 \times 2 = 10
\]
\[
-8 \times (-2) = 16
\]
So, subtracting these: \( 10 - 16 = -6 \). But since it's the j-component, it becomes \( -(-6) = 6 \).

Wait, hold on. Let me recall the cross product formula properly. The cross product of vectors \( \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix} \) is:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, applying this correctly:

First component (i):
\( a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 = 7 \times (-2) - 5 \times (-9) = -14 + 45 = 31 \)

Second component (j):
\( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 = 5 \times 2 - (-8) \times (-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \)

Third component (k):
\( a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 = (-8) \times (-9) - 7 \times 2 = 72 - 14 = 58 \)

So, putting it all together:
\[
\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Wait, hold on, the second component is negative, so in the cross product, it's actually:
\[
\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -(-6) \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ 6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Wait, no, I think I confused myself. Let me double-check.

The cross product formula is:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \left( a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2, a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3, a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \right)
\]
So, for the j-component, it's \( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \). So, substituting:
\( a_3 = 5 \), \( b_1 = 2 \), \( a_1 = -8 \), \( b_3 = -2 \)
So, \( 5 \times 2 - (-8) \times (-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \)
But in the cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's actually \( - (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \). Wait, no, the cross product formula is:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \left( a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2, a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3, a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \right)
\]
So, the j-component is \( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \), which is \( 5 \times 2 - (-8) \times (-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \). So, the j-component is -6, but in the cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's actually \( -(-6) = 6 \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the cross product is defined as:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, the j-component is \( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \), which is \( 5 \times 2 - (-8) \times (-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \). So, the j-component is -6, but in the cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's actually \( -(-6) = 6 \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the cross product is a vector where the j-component is \( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \), which is -6, but in the standard cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's actually \( - (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \). Wait, no, I think I'm overcomplicating.

Let me just compute it step by step without confusion.

Given \( \mathbf{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

Compute \( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} \):

i-component: \( (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) = -14 + 45 = 31 \)

j-component: \( (5)(2) - (-8)(-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \). But in the cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's \( -(-6) = 6 \).

Wait, no, actually, the cross product formula is:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \left( a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2, a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3, a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \right)
\]

So, the j-component is \( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \), which is \( 5 \times 2 - (-8) \times (-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \). So, the j-component is -6, but in the cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's actually \( -(-6) = 6 \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, no, the cross product is a vector where the j-component is \( a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \), which is -6, but in the standard cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's actually \( - (a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3) \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

I think I'm confusing myself. Let me just write it out properly.

The cross product is calculated as:

i: \( (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) = -14 + 45 = 31 \)

j: \( (5)(2) - (-8)(-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \). But in the cross product, the j-component is subtracted, so it's \( -(-6) = 6 \).

k: \( (-8)(-9) - (7)(2) = 72 - 14 = 58 \)

So, putting it all together, the cross product is:
\[
\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ 6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Wait, no, that can't be right because the j-component was calculated as -6, but in the cross product, it's subtracted, so it becomes positive 6. So, yes, the cross product is \( \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ 6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \).

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector.

The magnitude \( |\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v}| \) is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) cross (3c + a). I'm given the cross products of a, b, and c with each other: a cross b, a cross c, and b cross c. Hmm, let me write those down to keep track.

Given:
- a × b = [6, -7, 3]
- a × c = [4, 7, 2]
- b × c = [1, -7, 18]

I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, cross product is distributive over vector addition, right? So I can expand this expression using the distributive property. Let me recall the formula for cross product distribution:

(u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x

So applying that to (2b - a) × (3c + a), I can expand it as:

2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a

Wait, let me make sure I distribute correctly. It should be:

(2b) × (3c) + (2b) × a + (-a) × (3c) + (-a) × a

Simplify each term:

First term: 2b × 3c = 6(b × c)
Second term: 2b × a = 2(b × a)
Third term: -a × 3c = -3(a × c)
Fourth term: -a × a = -(a × a)

Now, I remember that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so the fourth term is zero. So we can ignore that term.

So now, the expression simplifies to:

6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c)

But wait, I also remember that cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that b × a = - (a × b). So let me rewrite the second term:

2(b × a) = 2(-a × b) = -2(a × b)

So substituting back, the expression becomes:

6(b × c) - 2(a × b) - 3(a × c)

Now, I can plug in the given cross products:

6(b × c) is 6 times [1, -7, 18], which is [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108]

-2(a × b) is -2 times [6, -7, 3], which is [-12, 14, -6]

-3(a × c) is -3 times [4, 7, 2], which is [-12, -21, -6]

Now, I need to add these three vectors together:

First vector: [6, -42, 108]
Second vector: [-12, 14, -6]
Third vector: [-12, -21, -6]

Let me add them component-wise.

For the x-component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 -12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18

For the y-component: -42 + 14 + (-21) = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49

For the z-component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96

So putting it all together, the resulting vector is [-18, -49, 96]

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First term: 6(b × c) = [6, -42, 108] – that seems correct.

Second term: -2(a × b) = -2[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6] – correct.

Third term: -3(a × c) = -3[4,7,2] = [-12, -21, -6] – correct.

Adding x-components: 6 -12 -12 = -18 – correct.

Adding y-components: -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49 – correct.

Adding z-components: 108 -6 -6 = 96 – correct.

So, the final result is [-18, -49, 96]. Hmm, let me just make sure I didn't mix up any signs.

Wait, in the second term, it's -2(a × b). Since a × b is [6, -7, 3], multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6], which is correct.

Third term is -3(a × c). a × c is [4,7,2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6], which is correct.

Adding all together:

x: 6 -12 -12 = -18

y: -42 +14 -21 = -49

z: 108 -6 -6 = 96

Yes, that seems right. So I think the final answer is [-18, -49, 96].

**Final Answer**
The result of $(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})$ is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

Given the cross products of vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to compute \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

First, we expand the expression using the distributive property of the cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Simplifying each term:

1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})\)
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\)
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})\)
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\)

Substituting the given cross products:

1. \(6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(-2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
3. \(-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)

Adding these vectors component-wise:

- For the x-component: \(6 - 12 - 12 = -18\)
- For the y-component: \(-42 + 14 - 21 = -49\)
- For the z-component: \(108 - 6 - 6 = 96\)

Thus, the result of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is:

"Okay, so I have this problem about a trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. They also told me that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me draw a rough sketch. Since AD is parallel to BC, ABCD is a trapezoid with bases AD and BC. Let me label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D. So, sides AB and CD are the non-parallel sides. Now, AC is one of the diagonals, and it's perpendicular to CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. That means angle BAC is equal to angle CAD.

Let me note down the given information:

1. AD || BC
2. AC ⊥ CD
3. AC bisects ∠BAD
4. Area of trapezoid ABCD is 42
5. Find area of triangle ACD

I think I should assign some variables to the sides to make this more concrete. Let me denote:

- Let’s let AD = a, BC = b, since they are the two bases.
- Let’s denote the height of the trapezoid as h. Since AD || BC, the distance between these two sides is the height.
- The area of the trapezoid is given by (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42.

So, (a + b)*h = 84.

Now, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle with right angle at C. So, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*AC*CD.

But I don't know AC or CD yet. Maybe I can express them in terms of a, b, and h.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC = angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAD as 2θ, so each of the angles BAC and CAD is θ.

Since AC is a diagonal, maybe I can use some trigonometric relationships here. Let me consider triangle ABC and triangle ACD.

Wait, but AC is perpendicular to CD, so in triangle ACD, angle at C is 90 degrees. So, triangle ACD is right-angled at C.

Let me think about triangle ACD. In this triangle, AC is one leg, CD is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse. So, AC^2 + CD^2 = AD^2.

But I don't know AC or CD. Maybe I can relate them through the trapezoid.

Since AC bisects angle BAD, which is 2θ, and in triangle ACD, angle at A is θ. So, in triangle ACD, angle at A is θ, angle at C is 90 degrees, so angle at D must be 90 - θ.

Wait, but AD is parallel to BC, so angle ADC is equal to angle BCD because they are consecutive angles on the same side of the transversal DC. Hmm, not sure if that helps immediately.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem. Since AC bisects angle BAD, the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of BC to CD. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it should divide side BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. But BD is a diagonal, not a side. Hmm, maybe that's not directly applicable here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and let's assume AD is horizontal for simplicity. So, point D can be at (a, 0). Then, since AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC is a diagonal, point C must be somewhere such that AC is perpendicular to CD.

Wait, let me think. If AC is perpendicular to CD, then the slope of AC times the slope of CD should be -1.

Let me assign coordinates:

- Let’s set A at (0,0).
- Since AD is parallel to BC, and let's assume AD is along the x-axis, so D is at (a, 0).
- Let’s denote point C as (c, h), since the height of the trapezoid is h, so the y-coordinate of C is h. Then, since BC is parallel to AD, point B must be at (b, h), because BC is the other base.

Wait, hold on. If AD is from (0,0) to (a,0), and BC is parallel to AD, then BC must also be horizontal. So, if point C is at (c, h), then point B must be at (c - b, h), because BC has length b. Wait, maybe I need to adjust that.

Alternatively, let me define the coordinates more carefully.

Let me set A at (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and let's assume AD is along the x-axis, so D is at (d, 0). Then, since BC is parallel to AD, BC must also be horizontal. Let me denote point B as (x, h) and point C as (x + b, h), where b is the length of BC. So, BC is from (x, h) to (x + b, h). Then, AD is from (0,0) to (d, 0).

Now, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(x + b, h). AC is perpendicular to CD. CD is from C(x + b, h) to D(d, 0). So, the slope of AC is (h - 0)/(x + b - 0) = h/(x + b). The slope of CD is (0 - h)/(d - (x + b)) = (-h)/(d - x - b).

Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes should be -1:

(h/(x + b)) * (-h/(d - x - b)) = -1

Simplify:

(-h^2)/[(x + b)(d - x - b)] = -1

Multiply both sides by denominator:

(-h^2) = -1 * (x + b)(d - x - b)

Simplify negatives:

h^2 = (x + b)(d - x - b)

So, h^2 = (x + b)(d - x - b)

Let me note that down as equation (1).

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC = angle CAD.

In coordinate terms, angle between BA and AC is equal to angle between CA and AD.

Wait, BA is from A(0,0) to B(x, h). AC is from A(0,0) to C(x + b, h). AD is from A(0,0) to D(d, 0).

So, the angle between BA and AC is equal to the angle between AC and AD.

Using vectors, the angle between BA and AC is equal to the angle between AC and AD.

The vector BA is (x, h), vector AC is (x + b, h), and vector AD is (d, 0).

The angle between BA and AC can be found using the dot product:

cos(theta1) = (BA · AC) / (|BA| |AC|)

Similarly, the angle between AC and AD:

cos(theta2) = (AC · AD) / (|AC| |AD|)

Since theta1 = theta2, their cosines are equal:

(BA · AC) / (|BA| |AC|) = (AC · AD) / (|AC| |AD|)

Simplify:

(BA · AC) / |BA| = (AC · AD) / |AD|

Compute the dot products:

BA · AC = (x)(x + b) + (h)(h) = x(x + b) + h^2

AC · AD = (x + b)(d) + (h)(0) = d(x + b)

|BA| = sqrt(x^2 + h^2)

|AD| = sqrt(d^2 + 0^2) = d

So, plugging into the equation:

[x(x + b) + h^2] / sqrt(x^2 + h^2) = [d(x + b)] / d

Simplify the right side:

[d(x + b)] / d = x + b

So, left side:

[x(x + b) + h^2] / sqrt(x^2 + h^2) = x + b

Multiply both sides by sqrt(x^2 + h^2):

x(x + b) + h^2 = (x + b) sqrt(x^2 + h^2)

Let me denote sqrt(x^2 + h^2) as |BA|, which is the length of BA.

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

[x(x + b) + h^2]^2 = (x + b)^2 (x^2 + h^2)

Expand the left side:

[x(x + b) + h^2]^2 = [x^2 + bx + h^2]^2

= (x^2 + bx + h^2)^2

= x^4 + 2bx^3 + (b^2 + 2h^2)x^2 + 2b h^2 x + h^4

Right side:

(x + b)^2 (x^2 + h^2) = (x^2 + 2bx + b^2)(x^2 + h^2)

= x^4 + h^2 x^2 + 2b x^3 + 2b h^2 x + b^2 x^2 + b^2 h^2

= x^4 + 2b x^3 + (h^2 + b^2) x^2 + 2b h^2 x + b^2 h^2

Now, set left side equal to right side:

x^4 + 2bx^3 + (b^2 + 2h^2)x^2 + 2b h^2 x + h^4 = x^4 + 2b x^3 + (h^2 + b^2) x^2 + 2b h^2 x + b^2 h^2

Subtract right side from left side:

[ x^4 - x^4 ] + [2bx^3 - 2bx^3] + [ (b^2 + 2h^2)x^2 - (h^2 + b^2)x^2 ] + [2b h^2 x - 2b h^2 x] + [h^4 - b^2 h^2] = 0

Simplify each term:

0 + 0 + (2h^2 - h^2)x^2 + 0 + (h^4 - b^2 h^2) = 0

So:

h^2 x^2 + h^4 - b^2 h^2 = 0

Factor out h^2:

h^2 (x^2 + h^2 - b^2) = 0

Since h ≠ 0 (it's the height of the trapezoid), we have:

x^2 + h^2 - b^2 = 0

So:

x^2 + h^2 = b^2

Therefore, x^2 = b^2 - h^2

So, x = sqrt(b^2 - h^2)

Hmm, interesting. So, x is sqrt(b^2 - h^2). Let me note that.

Now, going back to equation (1):

h^2 = (x + b)(d - x - b)

We can substitute x = sqrt(b^2 - h^2) into this equation.

Let me compute (x + b):

x + b = sqrt(b^2 - h^2) + b

And (d - x - b):

d - x - b = d - (sqrt(b^2 - h^2) + b) = d - b - sqrt(b^2 - h^2)

So, equation (1) becomes:

h^2 = [sqrt(b^2 - h^2) + b][d - b - sqrt(b^2 - h^2)]

Let me denote sqrt(b^2 - h^2) as s for simplicity.

So, s = sqrt(b^2 - h^2)

Then, equation (1) becomes:

h^2 = (s + b)(d - b - s)

Multiply out the right side:

= (s + b)(d - b - s) = (s + b)(d - b - s) = (s + b)(d - b - s)

Let me expand this:

= s*(d - b - s) + b*(d - b - s)

= s(d - b) - s^2 + b(d - b) - b s

= s d - s b - s^2 + b d - b^2 - b s

Combine like terms:

= s d - s b - s^2 + b d - b^2 - b s

= s d - 2 s b - s^2 + b d - b^2

Now, substitute back s = sqrt(b^2 - h^2):

= sqrt(b^2 - h^2)*d - 2 sqrt(b^2 - h^2)*b - (b^2 - h^2) + b d - b^2

Simplify term by term:

First term: sqrt(b^2 - h^2)*d

Second term: -2b sqrt(b^2 - h^2)

Third term: -b^2 + h^2

Fourth term: +b d

Fifth term: -b^2

So, combining:

= d sqrt(b^2 - h^2) - 2b sqrt(b^2 - h^2) - b^2 + h^2 + b d - b^2

Combine like terms:

- The terms with sqrt(b^2 - h^2): d sqrt(b^2 - h^2) - 2b sqrt(b^2 - h^2) = sqrt(b^2 - h^2)(d - 2b)

- The constant terms: -b^2 + h^2 + b d - b^2 = b d - 2b^2 + h^2

So, overall:

sqrt(b^2 - h^2)(d - 2b) + b d - 2b^2 + h^2 = h^2

So, moving h^2 to the left:

sqrt(b^2 - h^2)(d - 2b) + b d - 2b^2 = 0

Let me factor out b from the last two terms:

"Okay, so I have this problem where four points A, B, C, and D are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. I need to find the probability that the line segments AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I should visualize the problem. Imagine a circle with four points on its circumference. These points are placed randomly, so their positions are not predetermined. The question is about the probability that when I connect A to B and C to D, these two chords intersect each other inside the circle.

I remember that for two chords to intersect inside a circle, the four points must be arranged in such a way that one chord is ""crossing"" the other. That is, the points must alternate around the circle. For example, if the points are in the order A, C, B, D as you go around the circle, then chords AB and CD will intersect. But if the points are in the order A, B, C, D, then the chords won't intersect.

So, the key here is the arrangement of the four points on the circle. Since the points are chosen randomly, all possible arrangements are equally likely. Therefore, the probability that the chords intersect should be equal to the number of arrangements where the points alternate divided by the total number of possible arrangements.

Let me think about how many ways the four points can be arranged on the circle. Since the circle is a continuous loop, the number of distinct arrangements is related to the number of ways to order the points. However, because the circle doesn't have a fixed starting point, the number of distinct orderings is (4-1)! = 6. Wait, is that right? Actually, for n points on a circle, the number of distinct arrangements is (n-1)! because rotations are considered the same. So for four points, it's 3! = 6.

But wait, actually, when considering the order of points around a circle, it's often useful to fix one point and arrange the others relative to it. So, if I fix point A at a certain position, the other three points B, C, and D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways around the circle. That makes sense.

Now, out of these 6 possible arrangements, how many result in the chords AB and CD intersecting? Let's list them:

1. A, B, C, D: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
2. A, B, D, C: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
3. A, C, B, D: Chords AB and CD intersect.
4. A, C, D, B: Chords AB and CD intersect.
5. A, D, B, C: Chords AB and CD intersect.
6. A, D, C, B: Chords AB and CD intersect.

Wait, hold on. Let me check each case:

1. A, B, C, D: The order is A, then B, then C, then D. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. These chords don't cross because all points are in sequence. So, no intersection.

2. A, B, D, C: Similarly, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from D to C. Since D comes after B and C comes after D, chord CD is from D to C, which is a chord that goes back towards C. But does it cross AB? Let me visualize: A, B, D, C. So, chord AB is between A and B, chord CD is between D and C. Since D is next to B and C is next to D, chord CD is adjacent to chord AB but doesn't cross it. So, no intersection.

3. A, C, B, D: Here, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. The order is A, C, B, D. So, chord AB goes from A to B, which is after C. Chord CD goes from C to D, which is after B. So, these chords cross each other inside the circle. So, yes, they intersect.

4. A, C, D, B: Chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. The order is A, C, D, B. So, chord AB goes from A to B, which is after D. Chord CD goes from C to D, which is next to C. So, chord CD is between C and D, and chord AB is from A to B, which is after D. So, do they cross? Let me think. If you have A, then C, then D, then B. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is a long chord passing through the circle, and chord CD is a shorter chord between C and D. Do they cross? Yes, because chord AB passes from A to B, which is on the opposite side of the circle from C and D. So, chord AB would cross chord CD. So, yes, they intersect.

5. A, D, B, C: Chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. The order is A, D, B, C. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is after D. Chord CD is from C to D, which is after B. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since C is after B, chord CD is from C to D, which is before C. Wait, no, chord CD is from C to D, but in the order A, D, B, C, D is after A, then B is after D, then C is after B. So, chord CD is from C to D, which is a chord that goes back towards D. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is after D, and chord CD is from C to D, which is before C. So, do they cross? Let me visualize: A, D, B, C. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is a chord that goes from A, passes through the circle, and ends at B. Chord CD is from C to D, which is a chord that goes from C, passes through the circle, and ends at D. Since C is after B, and D is after A, these two chords should cross each other. So, yes, they intersect.

6. A, D, C, B: Chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. The order is A, D, C, B. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is after C. Chord CD is from C to D, which is after A. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is a chord that goes from A, passes through the circle, and ends at B. Chord CD is from C to D, which is a chord that goes from C, passes through the circle, and ends at D. Since C is after D, and D is after A, chord CD is from C to D, which is a chord that goes back towards D. So, chord AB is from A to B, which is after C, and chord CD is from C to D, which is before C. So, do they cross? Yes, because chord AB is going from A to B, which is on the opposite side of the circle from C and D, and chord CD is going from C to D, which is on the opposite side from A and B. So, they must cross each other. So, yes, they intersect.

Wait, hold on. Let me recount. In the 6 possible arrangements, how many result in intersecting chords?

Looking back:

1. A, B, C, D: No intersection.
2. A, B, D, C: No intersection.
3. A, C, B, D: Intersection.
4. A, C, D, B: Intersection.
5. A, D, B, C: Intersection.
6. A, D, C, B: Intersection.

So, out of 6 arrangements, 4 result in intersecting chords. Therefore, the probability is 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3.

Wait, but I thought the probability was 1/3. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me think again.

Alternatively, maybe I'm overcounting. Because when I fix point A, the number of ways the other points can be arranged is 3! = 6, but perhaps not all of these are unique in terms of chord intersections.

Wait, another approach: For four points on a circle, the number of ways to pair them into two chords is 3. Specifically, the pairings are AB-CD, AC-BD, and AD-BC. Out of these three pairings, only one results in intersecting chords. So, the probability is 1/3.

Wait, that contradicts my earlier conclusion of 2/3. Hmm, so which one is correct?

Let me clarify. The problem states that four points are chosen randomly, and then we connect A to B and C to D. So, the pairing is fixed as AB and CD. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is not about all possible pairings, but specifically about the arrangement of these four points.

So, in that case, the probability is determined by the order of the points around the circle. As I initially thought, fixing point A, the other three points can be arranged in 6 ways. Out of these, how many result in AB and CD intersecting?

Wait, in my earlier analysis, I found that 4 out of 6 arrangements result in intersection. But that seems high. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the correct way is to consider that for two chords AB and CD to intersect, the four points must be arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, the order must be A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C or similar. So, how many such arrangements are there?

If I fix point A, then the other three points can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways. For chords AB and CD to intersect, points C and D must be separated by point B. That is, the order must be A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C. So, that's two specific arrangements.

Wait, but in my earlier list, I had four arrangements where chords intersect. So, which is correct?

Wait, perhaps I'm confusing the concept. Let me think differently.

Imagine fixing point A. Then, the positions of B, C, D can be anywhere on the circle. The probability that chord AB intersects chord CD depends on the relative positions of B, C, D.

Alternatively, another approach: Once A is fixed, the positions of B, C, D are random on the circumference. The probability that chord AB intersects chord CD is equal to the probability that points C and D lie on different arcs determined by chord AB.

Wait, that might be a better way to think about it. So, if I fix points A and B, they divide the circle into two arcs. For chords AB and CD to intersect, points C and D must lie on different arcs. So, the probability is the probability that C and D are on different arcs.

But wait, since the points are chosen independently and uniformly, the probability that C is on one arc and D is on the other is equal to 2 * (length of arc AB / circumference) * (length of the other arc / circumference). But since the circle is continuous and we're dealing with probabilities, the exact lengths don't matter because of rotational symmetry.

Wait, actually, since the circle is uniform, the probability that C and D lie on different arcs determined by AB is equal to 2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/2. But that can't be right because I know the answer is 1/3.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Alternatively, perhaps the probability that two chords intersect is 1/3 because there are three possible pairings of four points into two chords, and only one of them results in intersecting chords.

Wait, that seems more plausible. So, if we have four points, the number of ways to pair them into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Out of these three, only one pairing results in intersecting chords. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

But in the problem, the pairing is fixed as AB and CD. So, does that change the probability?

Wait, no, because the points are chosen randomly. So, regardless of the pairing, the probability that a specific pairing intersects is 1/3.

Wait, but earlier, when I fixed A and considered the arrangements, I thought it was 2/3. So, which is correct?

I think the confusion arises from whether we're considering all possible pairings or a fixed pairing.

In this problem, the pairing is fixed: AB and CD. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is not about all possible pairings, but about the specific pairing given the random arrangement of the four points.

So, perhaps my initial approach was correct, but I made a mistake in counting.

Let me try again. Fix point A. The other three points B, C, D are randomly placed on the circle. The probability that chords AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that points C and D are on different arcs determined by chord AB.

But since the circle is continuous, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is equal to the probability that one is on one side of AB and the other is on the other side.

Given that AB divides the circle into two arcs, the probability that C is on one arc is 1/2, and then the probability that D is on the other arc is 1/2. So, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is 2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/2.

Wait, but that would suggest the probability is 1/2, which contradicts my earlier thought of 1/3.

Hmm, I must be making a mistake here.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that when we fix A, the positions of B, C, D are not independent anymore because once B is placed, it affects the arcs.

Wait, no, because all points are chosen independently. So, fixing A doesn't affect the distribution of B, C, D.

Alternatively, maybe I should think in terms of circular permutations.

The number of ways to arrange four points on a circle is (4-1)! = 6. As I did earlier. Out of these, how many have AB and CD intersecting?

Wait, in my earlier analysis, I found that 4 out of 6 arrangements result in intersecting chords. But that seems high because I thought the answer was 1/3.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcounting because some arrangements are equivalent under rotation or reflection.

Wait, no, because when I fix point A, the other points are arranged relative to A, so each arrangement is unique.

Wait, let me list all 6 arrangements again:

1. A, B, C, D: No intersection.
2. A, B, D, C: No intersection.
3. A, C, B, D: Intersection.

"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here with two circles, both with center D. One has a radius of 1 and the other 2. The total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of the smaller angle ADC in degrees. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, since both circles have the same center D, they are concentric. That means one is inside the other. The larger circle has a radius of 2, so its area is π*(2)^2 = 4π. The smaller circle has a radius of 1, so its area is π*(1)^2 = π. 

The problem says the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, 5/12 of 4π is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. That means the shaded area is (5/3)π. 

Wait, but the smaller circle has an area of π, which is less than (5/3)π. So, maybe the shaded area is a part of the larger circle that's outside the smaller one? Or perhaps it's a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle? Hmm, I need to think about how the shading is done.

Since the problem mentions angle ADC, which is a central angle, I think the shaded area is probably a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. So, if I can find the angle θ (which is angle ADC) such that the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector equals (5/3)π.

Let me write that down. The area of a sector is (θ/360)*π*r². So, for the larger circle, the sector area is (θ/360)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/360)*4π. For the smaller circle, it's (θ/360)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/360)*π. 

So, the shaded area would be the difference between these two: (θ/360)*4π - (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π. 

We know this shaded area is equal to (5/3)π. So, setting up the equation:

(θ/360)*3π = (5/3)π

Let me solve for θ. First, I can divide both sides by π to get rid of π:

(θ/360)*3 = 5/3

Then, multiply both sides by 360:

θ*3 = (5/3)*360

Simplify the right side:

(5/3)*360 = 5*120 = 600

So, θ*3 = 600

Divide both sides by 3:

θ = 600 / 3 = 200

Wait, that gives θ as 200 degrees. But the problem mentions the ""menšího"" (smaller) angle ADC. So, 200 degrees is the larger angle, and the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Hmm, but wait, 200 degrees is already more than 180, so the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

But let me double-check my calculations because 200 degrees seems a bit large. Let me go through the steps again.

The shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. The larger circle's area is 4π, so 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. 

The shaded area is the area between the two sectors, so it's the area of the larger sector minus the smaller sector. So, (θ/360)*4π - (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*3π. 

Set that equal to (5/3)π:

(θ/360)*3π = (5/3)π

Divide both sides by π:

(θ/360)*3 = 5/3

Multiply both sides by 360:

θ*3 = (5/3)*360

Calculate (5/3)*360: 5*120 = 600

So, θ*3 = 600 => θ = 200 degrees.

So, the angle ADC is 200 degrees, but since it's asking for the smaller angle, it's 360 - 200 = 160 degrees. Wait, but 200 degrees is the angle of the sector, which is the larger angle. So, the smaller angle would be 160 degrees.

But wait, in a circle, the smaller angle between two points is the one less than or equal to 180 degrees. So, 200 degrees is the reflex angle, and the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, the measure of the smaller angle ADC is 160 degrees.

But let me think again. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. The area between the two sectors is (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π. So, (θ/360)*3π = (5/3)π. 

Solving for θ: θ = (5/3)π * (360)/(3π) = (5/3)*(360/3) = (5/3)*120 = 200 degrees. So, yes, θ is 200 degrees, which is the larger angle. Therefore, the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

Wait, but 200 degrees is the angle of the sector, so the central angle is 200 degrees, but the smaller angle between the two radii would be 160 degrees. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

But let me confirm if the shaded area is indeed the area between the two sectors. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. The area of the annulus (the area between the two circles) is 4π - π = 3π. So, the shaded area is (5/3)π, which is less than 3π, so it's a portion of the annulus.

Therefore, the angle θ corresponds to the sector of the annulus that is shaded. So, the area of the shaded sector is (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π. Setting that equal to (5/3)π, we get θ = 200 degrees. So, the central angle is 200 degrees, but since we're asked for the smaller angle, it's 160 degrees.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it says ""velikost (menšího) úhlu ADC"". So, ""velikost"" means ""measure"", and ""menšího"" means ""smaller"". So, they are asking for the measure of the smaller angle ADC, which is 160 degrees.

But let me think again. If the central angle is 200 degrees, then the smaller angle is 160 degrees. So, yes, 160 degrees is the measure of the smaller angle ADC.

Wait, but I'm a bit confused because sometimes in such problems, the shaded area could be a segment or something else. But given that it's two concentric circles, and the angle is at the center, it's more likely that the shaded area is a sector of the annulus, which is the area between the two sectors.

So, I think my reasoning is correct. The central angle is 200 degrees, so the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

But just to be thorough, let me check if 160 degrees would give the correct shaded area.

If θ is 160 degrees, then the shaded area would be (160/360)*3π = (4/9)*3π = (4/3)π. But (4/3)π is less than (5/3)π, which is the given shaded area. So, that can't be.

Wait, that's a problem. If θ is 160 degrees, the shaded area is (160/360)*3π = (4/9)*3π = (4/3)π, which is less than (5/3)π. So, that's not matching.

Wait, so maybe I was wrong earlier. Maybe the angle is 200 degrees, and that's the measure of the smaller angle? But 200 degrees is larger than 180, so the smaller angle should be 160 degrees.

But if θ is 200 degrees, the shaded area is (200/360)*3π = (5/9)*3π = (5/3)π, which matches the given shaded area. So, θ is 200 degrees, which is the measure of the larger angle, and the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

But the problem asks for the measure of the smaller angle ADC. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's possible that the shaded area is the smaller sector, not the larger one. So, if the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π, and if that's the area of the smaller sector, then:

(θ/360)*π = (5/3)π

Which would give θ = (5/3)*360 = 600 degrees, which is impossible because a circle is 360 degrees. So, that can't be.

Therefore, the shaded area must be the area between the two sectors, which is (θ/360)*(4π - π) = (θ/360)*3π = (5/3)π. So, θ = 200 degrees, which is the larger angle, and the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

So, the measure of the smaller angle ADC is 160 degrees.

Wait, but let me think again. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. The area of the annulus is 3π, so the shaded area is (5/3)π, which is 5/9 of the annulus. So, the angle θ is 5/9 of 360 degrees, which is 200 degrees. So, θ is 200 degrees, which is the larger angle, and the smaller angle is 160 degrees.

Yes, that makes sense. So, the answer is 160 degrees.

"Okay, so I have this problem to evaluate the expression:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that involve the sine of sums and differences. Maybe I can use those to simplify the expression. Let me recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

So, if I let \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), then the expression becomes:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)
\]

Which, using the identities, would be:

\[
[\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B] \cdot [\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B]
\]

Wait, that looks like the product of a sum and difference, which is a difference of squares. So, this simplifies to:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Okay, so that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to compute this expression. Let me write that down:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

But I know that \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \). So, \( \sin A = 0.4 \) and \( \sin B = 0.5 \). I need to find \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \) to plug into the equation.

I remember that \( \cos(\arcsin x) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Let me verify that. If \( \theta = \arcsin x \), then \( \sin \theta = x \), and \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) because \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \). So, yes, that's correct.

So, let's compute \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \):

For \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84}

Hmm, \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is approximately 0.9165, but maybe I can keep it exact for now.

For \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \):
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Okay, so \( \cos B \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).

So, plugging back into the expression:

First, compute \( \sin A \cos B \):
\[
\sin A \cos B = 0.4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 0.2 \sqrt{3}
\]

Then, compute \( \cos A \sin B \):
\[
\cos A \sin B = \sqrt{0.84} \times 0.5 = 0.5 \sqrt{0.84}
\]

Wait, but \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is the same as \( \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Let me check that:

\( 21 \times 4 = 84 \), so \( \sqrt{84} = \sqrt{4 \times 21} = 2 \sqrt{21} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Yes, that's correct.

So, \( \cos A = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \). Therefore, \( \cos A \sin B = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \times 0.5 = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \).

So, now, going back to the expression:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2
\]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 \)
\[
(0.2)^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12
\]

Second term: \( \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \right)^2 \)
\[
\frac{21}{100} = 0.21
\]

So, subtracting the second term from the first:

\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Wait, that gives me a negative number. But sine functions can give negative results, so maybe that's okay. But let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the beginning:

1. Let \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \), so \( \sin A = 0.4 \), \( \cos A = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \).
2. Let \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), so \( \sin B = 0.5 \), \( \cos B = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \).
3. Then, \( \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \times 0.5 = 0.2 \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \).
4. Similarly, \( \sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = 0.2 \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} \).
5. Multiplying these together: \( (0.2 \sqrt{3} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10})(0.2 \sqrt{3} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}) \).
6. Which is \( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 - (\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10})^2 = 0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09 \).

Hmm, so the result is negative. But let me think about the original expression:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)
\]

Is it possible for this product to be negative? Let's consider the angles involved.

Since \( \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( \arcsin 0.5 \) are both in the range \( [-\pi/2, \pi/2] \), but since 0.4 and 0.5 are positive, they are in \( [0, \pi/2] \). So, \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately, let's see, since \( \sin(\pi/6) = 0.5 \), so \( \arcsin 0.5 = \pi/6 \approx 0.5236 \) radians. \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is a bit less, maybe around 0.4115 radians.

So, \( A + B \) is approximately 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351 radians, which is less than \( \pi/2 \) (≈1.5708), so \( \sin(A + B) \) is positive.

Similarly, \( A - B \) is approximately 0.4115 - 0.5236 ≈ -0.1121 radians, which is negative. So, \( \sin(A - B) \) is negative because sine is negative in the fourth quadrant.

Therefore, the product of a positive and a negative number is negative, which matches our result of -0.09. So, that seems consistent.

But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using another identity or formula that could simplify the computation.

I recall that there's an identity for the product of sines:

\[
\sin \alpha \sin \beta = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(\alpha - \beta) - \cos(\alpha + \beta)]
\]

But in this case, we have \( \sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\alpha - \beta) \). Wait, that's actually another identity:

\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) \sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin^2 \alpha - \sin^2 \beta
\]

Yes, that's another identity. Let me verify that:

Using the product-to-sum identities:

\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]
\]

But in our case, it's \( \sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) \). Let me set \( C = A + B \) and \( D = A - B \). Then, \( \sin C \sin D = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(C - D) - \cos(C + D)] \).

Compute \( C - D = (A + B) - (A - B) = 2B \)
Compute \( C + D = (A + B) + (A - B) = 2A \)

So, \( \sin C \sin D = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2B) - \cos(2A)] \)

Alternatively, another identity is:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Yes, that's correct because:

\[
\sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B) = \sin^2 A \cos^2 B - \cos^2 A \sin^2 B
\]
\[
= \sin^2 A (1 - \sin^2 B) - (1 - \sin^2 A) \sin^2 B = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 B + \sin^2 A \sin^2 B = \sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Yes, that works. So, another way to compute the original expression is:

\[
\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B
\]

Where \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \). Therefore, \( \sin A = 0.4 \) and \( \sin B = 0.5 \). So,

\[
\sin^2 A - \sin^2 B = (0.4)^2 - (0.5)^2 = 0.16 - 0.25 = -0.09
\]

So, that's a much simpler way to compute it! I should have thought of that identity earlier. It directly gives the result without having to compute the cosines and then square them.

So, both methods lead to the same result: -0.09.

But just to make sure, let me compute it numerically as well.

Compute \( \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( \arcsin 0.5 \):

- \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately 0.4115 radians.
- \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is exactly \( \pi/6 \) ≈ 0.5236 radians.

So, \( A + B ≈ 0.4115 + 0.5236 ≈ 0.9351 \) radians.
\( A - B ≈ 0.4115 - 0.5236 ≈ -0.1121 \) radians.

Compute \( \sin(0.9351) \) and \( \sin(-0.1121) \):

- \( \sin(0.9351) ≈ \sin(0.9351) ≈ 0.8078 \)
- \( \sin(-0.1121) ≈ -\sin(0.1121) ≈ -0.1120 \)

Multiply them together: \( 0.8078 \times (-0.1120) ≈ -0.0904 \)

Which is approximately -0.09, confirming our earlier result.

So, all methods lead to the same conclusion: the value is -0.09.

Therefore, the final answer is \boxed{-0.09}.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), and cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify this.

First, I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum identities or by recognizing them as parts of known formulas. Let me write down the expression again:

cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15)

Looking at the angles, I notice that each angle is double the previous one. Starting from 2π/15, then 4π/15, then 8π/15, and then 16π/15. So, each angle is 2 times the previous angle. That seems like a geometric progression with a common ratio of 2. Maybe there's a formula for the product of cosines where each angle is double the previous one.

I recall that there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines where each angle is a multiple of the previous one. Specifically, for angles that are powers of 2, there might be a telescoping product or something similar. Let me try to recall or derive such a formula.

I remember that for a product of cosines with angles doubling each time, there's a relationship involving sine functions. The formula is something like:

cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ) / (2^n sin θ)

Is that right? Let me test it with a small n. Let's take n=2:

cos(θ) * cos(2θ) = [sin(4θ)] / (4 sin θ)

Wait, let's compute the left side:

cos(θ) * cos(2θ) = [cos(θ + 2θ) + cos(θ - 2θ)] / 2 = [cos(3θ) + cos(-θ)] / 2 = [cos(3θ) + cos θ] / 2

But according to the formula, it should be sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ). Let me compute sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ):

sin(4θ) = 2 sin(2θ) cos(2θ) = 2*(2 sin θ cos θ) * cos(2θ) = 4 sin θ cos θ cos(2θ)

So, sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ) = (4 sin θ cos θ cos(2θ))/(4 sin θ) = cos θ cos(2θ). So yes, the formula holds for n=2.

Similarly, for n=3:

cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) = sin(8θ)/(8 sin θ)

Let me check:

Left side: cos θ * cos 2θ * cos 4θ

Using the formula for n=2, cos θ * cos 2θ = sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ). Then multiply by cos 4θ:

[sin(4θ)/(4 sin θ)] * cos 4θ = [sin(4θ) cos 4θ]/(4 sin θ) = [sin(8θ)]/(8 sin θ)

Which matches the formula. So, the formula seems to hold.

Therefore, in general, for n terms, the product is sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ). So, in our case, we have four terms: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), cos(16π/15). Let me see if I can fit this into the formula.

Wait, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. So, each angle is double the previous one, starting from 2π/15. So, if I let θ = 2π/15, then the angles are θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ. So, n=4 terms.

Therefore, according to the formula, the product should be sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). Let's compute that.

First, θ = 2π/15, so 16θ = 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15. But 32π/15 is more than 2π, so let's subtract 2π to find the equivalent angle:

32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Because sine has a period of 2π, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15 + 2π) = sin(2π/15).

Therefore, sin(16θ) = sin(2π/15). So, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin θ). But θ is 2π/15, so sin θ = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product becomes sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the product is 1/16? Let me verify.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the formula. The formula is:

Product from k=0 to n-1 of cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ)

In our case, n=4, so the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). But θ is 2π/15, so 16θ is 32π/15, which is equivalent to 32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

So, the product is 1/16. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me test it numerically to be sure.

Let me compute each cosine term numerically and multiply them together.

First, compute cos(2π/15):

2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians. cos(0.418879) ≈ 0.913545

cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(0.837758) ≈ 0.669131

cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(1.675516) ≈ -0.207912

cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(3.351032) ≈ -0.978148

Now, multiply them together:

0.913545 * 0.669131 ≈ 0.61185

0.61185 * (-0.207912) ≈ -0.1271

-0.1271 * (-0.978148) ≈ 0.1242

Hmm, 0.1242 is approximately 1/8, but 1/16 is 0.0625. Wait, that's not matching. So, my previous conclusion must be wrong.

Wait, that's confusing. According to the formula, it should be 1/16, but numerically, it's approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the formula. Let me check again.

The formula is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ)

In our case, n=4, so the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). But θ is 2π/15, so 16θ is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, sin(16θ) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But when I compute numerically, I get approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8, not 1/16. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the product starting from k=0, so cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * cos(8θ). But in our problem, the first term is cos(2π/15), which is cos(θ), but the next term is cos(4π/15) = cos(2θ), then cos(8π/15) = cos(4θ), and then cos(16π/15) = cos(8θ). So, yes, it's the same as the formula.

But then why is the numerical value not matching? Maybe I made a mistake in the numerical calculation.

Let me recalculate the numerical values more accurately.

First, compute each angle in radians:

2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians

cos(0.418879) ≈ cos(2π/15) ≈ 0.9135454576

4π/15 ≈ 0.837758 radians

cos(0.837758) ≈ 0.6691306064

8π/15 ≈ 1.675516 radians

cos(1.675516) ≈ -0.2079116918

16π/15 ≈ 3.351032 radians

cos(3.351032) ≈ -0.9781476007

Now, multiply them step by step:

First, multiply cos(2π/15) and cos(4π/15):

0.9135454576 * 0.6691306064 ≈ 0.611850394

Next, multiply by cos(8π/15):

0.611850394 * (-0.2079116918) ≈ -0.127104545

Then, multiply by cos(16π/15):

-0.127104545 * (-0.9781476007) ≈ 0.124222222

So, approximately 0.124222222, which is roughly 1/8.18, which is close to 1/8. So, 0.1242 is approximately 1/8, not 1/16.

Hmm, so my formula must be incorrect or I misapplied it. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the product of cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}θ) = sin(2^n θ)/(2^n sin θ). So, in our case, n=4, so the product is sin(16θ)/(16 sin θ). But θ is 2π/15, so 16θ is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But according to the numerical calculation, it's approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8. So, there's a discrepancy here. Maybe I made a mistake in the formula.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe the formula is for the product starting from k=1 instead of k=0? Or perhaps I miscounted the number of terms.

Wait, in the formula, for n terms, starting from k=0 to k=n-1, so for n=4, it's cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * cos(4θ) * cos(8θ). So, that's four terms, which is exactly what we have here. So, the formula should apply.

But then why is the numerical result not matching? Maybe I made a mistake in the numerical calculation.

Wait, let me compute sin(2π/15) and see what it is.

sin(2π/15) ≈ sin(0.418879) ≈ 0.4067366431

So, sin(2π/15) ≈ 0.4067366431

Then, 1/16 ≈ 0.0625

But according to the formula, the product is 1/16, but numerically, it's approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 2*(1/16). So, 0.1242 ≈ 2*(0.0625). So, maybe I missed a factor of 2 somewhere.

Wait, let me think again. Maybe the formula is for the product of cos(θ/2) * cos(θ) * cos(2θ) * ... * cos(2^{n-2}θ) = sin(2^{n-1}θ)/(2^{n-1} sin θ). Hmm, maybe I misapplied the formula.

Wait, let me look up the exact formula to make sure.

After a quick search in my mind, I recall that the product formula","[2, '2']",\frac{1}{16},"[1/16, '\\frac{1}{16}']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, and the height AM is 11 units long. There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the triangle is symmetric about the altitude AM. So, point M is the midpoint of BC, and AM is perpendicular to BC. That means BM equals MC. Let me denote the length of BM as x, so BC is 2x. Then, the sides AB and AC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABM. So, AB = AC = sqrt(AM² + BM²) = sqrt(11² + x²) = sqrt(121 + x²).

Now, point D is on AM such that AD = 10. Since AM is 11, that means DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1. So, D is very close to M, just 1 unit away from it.

The key condition here is that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.

Maybe I can use trigonometric identities or some triangle properties. Let me consider triangles ABD and ADC, but wait, D is on AM, so maybe triangles BDC and BAC are related? Hmm, not sure yet.

Alternatively, since D is on AM, which is the altitude, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the points to make it easier.

Let me place point A at (0, 11), M at (0, 0), so point D is at (0, 1). Then, since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, points B and C will be symmetric about the y-axis. Let me denote point B as (-x, 0) and point C as (x, 0). So, BC is from (-x, 0) to (x, 0), making its length 2x, as I thought earlier.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 11)
- B: (-x, 0)
- C: (x, 0)
- M: (0, 0)
- D: (0, 1)

Now, I need to find angle BAC and angle BDC.

First, angle BAC is the angle at point A between sides AB and AC. Since AB and AC are equal, this is the vertex angle of the isosceles triangle. Let me compute this angle θ.

In triangle ABM, which is right-angled at M, tan(θ/2) = BM / AM = x / 11. So, θ/2 = arctan(x / 11), which means θ = 2 arctan(x / 11).

Now, angle BDC is the angle at point D between points B, D, and C. So, I need to compute angle BDC in terms of x and set it equal to 3θ.

To find angle BDC, I can use coordinates. Let me compute vectors DB and DC.

Point D is at (0, 1). Point B is at (-x, 0), so vector DB is (-x, -1). Similarly, point C is at (x, 0), so vector DC is (x, -1).

The angle between vectors DB and DC can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(angle BDC) = (DB · DC) / (|DB| |DC|)

Compute the dot product:

DB · DC = (-x)(x) + (-1)(-1) = -x² + 1

Compute |DB| and |DC|:

|DB| = sqrt((-x)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(x² + 1)
|DC| = sqrt((x)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(x² + 1)

So, cos(angle BDC) = (-x² + 1) / (x² + 1)

But angle BDC is 3θ, so:

cos(3θ) = (-x² + 1) / (x² + 1)

Now, I need to express cos(3θ) in terms of θ, which is 2 arctan(x / 11). Let me find cos(3θ) using trigonometric identities.

First, let me find cos(θ). Since θ = 2 arctan(x / 11), let me use the double angle formula:

cos(θ) = cos(2 arctan(x / 11)) = (1 - tan²(arctan(x / 11))) / (1 + tan²(arctan(x / 11))) = (1 - (x² / 121)) / (1 + (x² / 121)) = (121 - x²) / (121 + x²)

Similarly, sin(θ) can be found as:

sin(θ) = sin(2 arctan(x / 11)) = 2 tan(arctan(x / 11)) / (1 + tan²(arctan(x / 11))) = 2*(x / 11) / (1 + x² / 121) = (2x / 11) / ((121 + x²)/121) ) = (2x / 11) * (121 / (121 + x²)) = (22x) / (121 + x²)

Now, to find cos(3θ), I can use the triple angle formula:

cos(3θ) = 4 cos³θ - 3 cosθ

Let me compute that:

cos(3θ) = 4*( (121 - x²)/(121 + x²) )³ - 3*( (121 - x²)/(121 + x²) )

Let me denote y = (121 - x²)/(121 + x²) for simplicity.

Then, cos(3θ) = 4y³ - 3y

But from earlier, we have:

cos(3θ) = (-x² + 1)/(x² + 1)

So, setting them equal:

4y³ - 3y = (-x² + 1)/(x² + 1)

Substituting y back:

4*( (121 - x²)/(121 + x²) )³ - 3*( (121 - x²)/(121 + x²) ) = (-x² + 1)/(x² + 1)

This looks complicated, but maybe we can simplify it.

Let me denote z = x² for simplicity. Then, the equation becomes:

4*( (121 - z)/(121 + z) )³ - 3*( (121 - z)/(121 + z) ) = ( -z + 1 )/( z + 1 )

Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS):

Let me compute (121 - z)/(121 + z) as a single term. Let me denote this as t = (121 - z)/(121 + z). Then, LHS is 4t³ - 3t.

So, 4t³ - 3t = ( -z + 1 )/( z + 1 )

But t = (121 - z)/(121 + z). Let me express t in terms of z:

t = (121 - z)/(121 + z)

So, 4t³ - 3t = ( -z + 1 )/( z + 1 )

Let me compute 4t³ - 3t:

First, compute t³:

t³ = [ (121 - z)/(121 + z) ]³

So, 4t³ = 4*(121 - z)³ / (121 + z)³

Similarly, 3t = 3*(121 - z)/(121 + z)

So, 4t³ - 3t = [4*(121 - z)³ - 3*(121 - z)*(121 + z)² ] / (121 + z)³

Let me compute the numerator:

4*(121 - z)³ - 3*(121 - z)*(121 + z)²

Factor out (121 - z):

(121 - z)[4*(121 - z)² - 3*(121 + z)²]

Let me compute the expression inside the brackets:

4*(121 - z)² - 3*(121 + z)²

Expand both squares:

First, (121 - z)² = 121² - 2*121*z + z² = 14641 - 242z + z²

Multiply by 4: 4*(14641 - 242z + z²) = 58564 - 968z + 4z²

Second, (121 + z)² = 121² + 2*121*z + z² = 14641 + 242z + z²

Multiply by 3: 3*(14641 + 242z + z²) = 43923 + 726z + 3z²

Now, subtract the second result from the first:

(58564 - 968z + 4z²) - (43923 + 726z + 3z²) = 58564 - 968z + 4z² - 43923 - 726z - 3z²

Combine like terms:

58564 - 43923 = 14641

-968z - 726z = -1694z

4z² - 3z² = z²

So, the numerator becomes:

(121 - z)(14641 - 1694z + z²)

Therefore, LHS is [ (121 - z)(14641 - 1694z + z²) ] / (121 + z)³

Set this equal to RHS, which is ( -z + 1 )/( z + 1 )

So:

[ (121 - z)(14641 - 1694z + z²) ] / (121 + z)³ = ( -z + 1 )/( z + 1 )

Cross-multiplying:

(121 - z)(14641 - 1694z + z²)(z + 1) = ( -z + 1 )(121 + z)³

This is a complicated equation, but let's try to simplify both sides.

First, note that (121 + z)³ is (z + 121)³, and (z + 1) is just (z + 1). Similarly, (121 - z) is (121 - z).

Let me see if I can factor or find a common term.

Alternatively, maybe I can substitute z = 121 - k or something, but not sure.

Alternatively, perhaps I can let z = 121 - t, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can try to find a value of z that satisfies this equation.

Given that z = x², and x is a real positive number, so z is positive.

Let me try plugging in z = 121. Then, LHS becomes (0)(...)(122) = 0, RHS becomes (-121 + 1)(242)³ = (-120)(...), which is not zero. So, z=121 is not a solution.

Wait, but z = x², and x is BM, which is less than AM=11, so z < 121. So, z is less than 121.

Let me try z = 120. Then, LHS:

(121 - 120)(14641 - 1694*120 + 120²)(120 + 1) = (1)(14641 - 203280 + 14400)(121) = (1)(14641 - 203280 + 14400) = (1)(-174239)(121) which is negative.

RHS: (-120 + 1)(121 + 120)³ = (-119)(241)³, which is also negative. But not sure if equal.

Alternatively, maybe z=100.

Compute LHS:

(121 - 100)(14641 - 1694*100 + 100²)(100 + 1) = (21)(14641 - 169400 + 10000)(101) = (21)(-154759)(101) which is a large negative number.

RHS: (-100 + 1)(121 + 100)³ = (-99)(221)³, also a large negative number. Not sure.

Alternatively, maybe z= something smaller.

Wait, perhaps I can factor the numerator on the LHS.

Looking back, the numerator was (121 - z)(14641 - 1694z + z²). Let me see if 14641 - 1694z + z² can be factored.

14641 is 121², so 14641 - 1694z + z² = z² - 1694z + 14641.

Let me check if this quadratic factors. The discriminant is (1694)^2 - 4*1*14641.

Compute 1694²: 1694*1694. Let me compute 1700² = 2,890,000. Subtract 6*1700*2 + 6² = 2,890,000 - 20,40","[20.4000000000000, '20.40']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the expression in the middle is x⁴ + 4x². That looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it easier. So, if I let y = x², then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. That seems simpler because now I can deal with a quadratic inequality in y.

Alright, so let me split this compound inequality into two separate inequalities. The first part is -4 < y² + 4y, and the second part is y² + 4y < 21. I'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions need to be satisfied.

Starting with the first inequality: -4 < y² + 4y. Let me rearrange this to make it easier to solve. I'll bring all terms to one side: y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Wait, that's because I added 4 to both sides. So, y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, that looks like a perfect square. Let me check: (y + 2)² = y² + 4y + 4. Yes, exactly. So, the inequality becomes (y + 2)² > 0.

Now, when is a square greater than zero? Well, a square is always non-negative, and it's zero only when the expression inside is zero. So, (y + 2)² > 0 means that y + 2 ≠ 0, which implies y ≠ -2. But wait, y was defined as x², and x² is always non-negative. So y can't be negative, let alone -2. Therefore, y is always greater than or equal to 0, so y ≠ -2 is automatically true because y can't be -2. So, the first inequality doesn't restrict y any further. It's always true for all real y, which in this case is y ≥ 0.

Okay, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21. Again, I'll rearrange this to bring all terms to one side: y² + 4y - 21 < 0. Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. First, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21. Plugging in, we get y = [-4 ± √(16 + 84)] / 2 = [-4 ± √100] / 2 = [-4 ± 10] / 2.

So, the roots are y = (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3, and y = (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7. Therefore, the quadratic can be factored as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.

To solve the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3. These divide the number line into three intervals: (-∞, -7), (-7, 3), and (3, ∞). I'll test each interval.

1. For y < -7, say y = -8: (-8 - 3)(-8 + 7) = (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0.
2. For -7 < y < 3, say y = 0: (0 - 3)(0 + 7) = (-3)(7) = -21 < 0.
3. For y > 3, say y = 4: (4 - 3)(4 + 7) = (1)(11) = 11 > 0.

Since we're looking for where the product is less than zero, the solution is the interval where the product is negative, which is (-7, 3). But remember, y = x², so y must be greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, the relevant interval for y is [0, 3).

So, combining both inequalities, from the first part, y can be any non-negative number, and from the second part, y must be less than 3. Therefore, the solution for y is 0 ≤ y < 3.

But y = x², so we have 0 ≤ x² < 3. Now, let's solve for x. The inequality x² < 3 implies that x is between -√3 and √3. Since x² is always non-negative, the lower bound is automatically satisfied. So, the solution for x is -√3 < x < √3.

Wait, let me double-check. If x² < 3, then x is in (-√3, √3). And since x² is always ≥ 0, the lower bound is already covered. So, yes, that seems correct.

But just to make sure, let me test a value in this interval and outside to see if it satisfies the original inequality.

Let's pick x = 0: x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0. So, -4 < 0 < 21, which is true.

Now, x = 2: x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32. 32 is not less than 21, so x = 2 is not in the solution set, which aligns with our interval since 2 is greater than √3 (~1.732).

What about x = -2: same as above, x⁴ + 4x² = 32, which is not less than 21. So, that's correct.

How about x = 1: x⁴ + 4x² = 1 + 4 = 5. -4 < 5 < 21, which is true.

And x = √3: x⁴ + 4x² = ( (√3)^4 ) + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so x = √3 is not included, which matches our interval.

Similarly, x = -√3 gives the same result, so it's excluded as well.

Therefore, the solution is all real numbers x such that x is between -√3 and √3, not including the endpoints.

So, in interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, consider the inequality \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\). Rearranging gives:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0 \]
Since \(y = x^2\) is always non-negative, this inequality is always true for all \(y \geq 0\).

Next, consider the inequality \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). Rearranging gives:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]
which gives \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic can be factored as:
\[ (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 \]
The solution to this inequality is \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) must be non-negative, we have \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Thus, \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\), which implies:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, I need to find \( xy + yz + zx \). I remember that in problems involving symmetric sums, sometimes it's helpful to use identities or known formulas. Let me think about what I know.

First, I recall that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Maybe that could be useful here since I have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) and \( xyz \) given.

Let me compute \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \). Plugging in the known values:

\( 4 - 3 \times 4 = 4 - 12 = -8 \).

So, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = -8 \). According to the identity, this is equal to \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). Also, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) can be expressed in terms of \( S \) and \( P \) as \( S^2 - 2P \).

So, substituting into the identity:

\( -8 = S \times ( (S^2 - 2P) - P ) = S(S^2 - 3P) \).

So, \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \). That's one equation involving \( S \) and \( P \).

Now, looking at the third equation given: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \).

Let me try to factor the expression. Notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. For example, \( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \). Similarly, \( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \), and \( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \).

So, the entire expression can be written as:

\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \).

Which simplifies to:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \).

Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can factor it further or express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \).

Let me expand each term:

\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + xy^2 \),
\( xz(x + z) = x^2 z + xz^2 \),
\( yz(y + z) = y^2 z + yz^2 \).

So, when we add them all together, we get the original expression, which is 12. So, that doesn't help much. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I can factor the expression as:

\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \).

Wait, maybe I can factor out terms differently. Let me see:

Notice that \( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(x + y) \), same as before. So, the entire expression is \( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \).

Let me denote \( x + y = a \), \( y + z = b \), \( z + x = c \). Then, the expression becomes \( xy a + xz c + yz b \).

But I don't know if that helps. Alternatively, maybe I can express this in terms of \( S \) and \( P \).

Let me think: \( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \).

Since \( x + y = S - z \), \( x + z = S - y \), \( y + z = S - x \).

So, substituting:

\( xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) \).

Expanding each term:

\( xyS - xyz + xzS - xyz + yzS - xyz \).

Combine like terms:

\( S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz \).

So, the entire expression is \( S P - 3 Q \).

Given that \( Q = 4 \), this becomes \( S P - 12 \).

But we know that this expression equals 12, so:

\( S P - 12 = 12 \).

Therefore, \( S P = 24 \).

So now, I have two equations:

1. \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \)
2. \( S P = 24 \)

Let me write them down:

1. \( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \)
2. \( S P = 24 \)

From equation 2, \( S P = 24 \), so I can substitute \( S P \) into equation 1.

Equation 1 becomes:

\( S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8 \)

Simplify:

\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \)

So, \( S^3 = 64 \)

Therefore, \( S = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \).

So, \( S = 4 \). Now, from equation 2, \( S P = 24 \), so \( 4 P = 24 \), which gives \( P = 6 \).

Therefore, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I used the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \), which is correct. Plugged in the values correctly, got \( -8 = S(S^2 - 3P) \).

Then, for the third equation, I factored it as \( S P - 3 Q \), which I think is correct because:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = S P - 3 Q \).

Yes, because each term \( xy(x + y) \) expands to \( x^2 y + x y^2 \), and when you sum all such terms, you get \( x^2 y + x y^2 + x^2 z + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 \), which is the given expression. Then, when you factor, you get \( S P - 3 Q \).

So, substituting \( Q = 4 \), we have \( S P - 12 = 12 \), so \( S P = 24 \). Then, using \( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \), substituting \( S P = 24 \), we get \( S^3 - 72 = -8 \), so \( S^3 = 64 \), hence \( S = 4 \). Then, \( P = 24 / 4 = 6 \).

That seems consistent. So, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is 6.

I think that's the answer. Let me just recap:

Given the three equations, I used the identity for the sum of cubes to relate \( S \) and \( P \), then manipulated the third equation to express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \), leading to two equations which I solved to find \( P = 6 \).

Yeah, I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in the reasoning.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
</think>

Given the equations:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 4 - 3 \times 4 = -8 \]
Thus,
\[ (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \]

Let \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). We know:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \]

Substituting into the identity:
\[ -8 = S(S^2 - 3P) \]

Next, we consider the third equation:
\[ xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \]

This can be factored as:
\[ xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \]

Expressing each term in terms of \( S \) and \( P \):
\[ xy(S - z) + xz(S - y) + yz(S - x) \]
Expanding and combining terms:
\[ S(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz \]
Thus,
\[ S P - 3 \times 4 = 12 \]
\[ S P - 12 = 12 \]
\[ S P = 24 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \)
2. \( S P = 24 \)

From the second equation, \( S P = 24 \). Substituting into the first equation:
\[ S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8 \]
\[ S^3 - 72 = -8 \]
\[ S^3 = 64 \]
\[ S = 4 \]

Substituting \( S = 4 \) into \( S P = 24 \):
\[ 4 P = 24 \]
\[ P = 6 \]

Thus, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is:

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions, I need to consider the critical points where the expression can change its sign. Also, I should note where the denominator is zero because the expression is undefined there.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

I know that the absolute value in the numerator, \(|x^2 - 81|\), is always non-negative because absolute values can't be negative. So, the numerator is either zero or positive. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which is a quadratic expression. I should factor that to find its roots.

Let me factor the denominator:

\(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\)

So, the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are the points where the expression is undefined, so I need to exclude them from the solution set.

Now, the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\). Let me factor that as well:

\(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). Therefore, the numerator is \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, as I thought earlier.

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Since the numerator is always non-negative, the sign of the entire expression depends on the denominator. The inequality is less than zero, so the expression must be negative. That means the denominator must be negative because the numerator is non-negative.

So, the inequality reduces to:

\[
\frac{\text{Non-negative}}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Which implies that:

\[
\frac{1}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Because the numerator is non-negative, the sign of the entire expression is determined by the denominator. So, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative.

Therefore, I need to find where \(x(x - 36) < 0\).

To solve \(x(x - 36) < 0\), I can analyze the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

The critical points divide the real number line into three intervals:

1. \(x < 0\)
2. \(0 < x < 36\)
3. \(x > 36\)

I can test each interval to determine the sign of \(x(x - 36)\) in that interval.

1. For \(x < 0\): Let's pick \(x = -1\). Then, \(x = -1\) is negative, and \(x - 36 = -37\) is also negative. Multiplying two negatives gives a positive. So, \(x(x - 36)\) is positive in this interval.

2. For \(0 < x < 36\): Let's pick \(x = 1\). Then, \(x = 1\) is positive, and \(x - 36 = -35\) is negative. Multiplying a positive and a negative gives a negative. So, \(x(x - 36)\) is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x > 36\): Let's pick \(x = 37\). Then, \(x = 37\) is positive, and \(x - 36 = 1\) is also positive. Multiplying two positives gives a positive. So, \(x(x - 36)\) is positive in this interval.

Therefore, \(x(x - 36) < 0\) is true only in the interval \(0 < x < 36\).

But wait, I also need to consider the numerator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), that is, when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). At these points, the entire expression is zero, but the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), so these points are not included in the solution.

So, I need to exclude \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) from the interval \(0 < x < 36\). However, \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), so only \(x = 9\) is within this interval and needs to be excluded.

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\).

But hold on, I should also check if the numerator is zero anywhere else. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but as I said, \(x = -9\) is not in the interval we're considering. So, only \(x = 9\) is a point where the expression is zero, which we need to exclude.

So, putting it all together, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) but \(x \neq 9\).

But wait, let me double-check. The original inequality is \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Since the numerator is non-negative, the expression is negative only when the denominator is negative. So, the denominator is negative when \(0 < x < 36\). But in that interval, the numerator is positive except at \(x = 9\), where it is zero. So, at \(x = 9\), the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, we have to exclude \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) with \(x \neq 9\).

But let me also consider the points where the expression is undefined, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These points are excluded from the domain, so they can't be part of the solution.

So, in interval notation, the solution is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

Wait, but I should also check if the numerator is positive or negative in different intervals. Wait, the numerator is an absolute value, so it's always non-negative. So, the sign of the entire expression is determined solely by the denominator. So, as long as the denominator is negative, the expression is negative, regardless of the numerator.

Therefore, the solution is all \(x\) where the denominator is negative, excluding points where the numerator is zero because at those points, the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the strict inequality.

So, the denominator is negative in \(0 < x < 36\), and the numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in \(0 < x < 36\), only \(x = 9\) is in that interval. So, we exclude \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\), which is written as \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

But let me test a point in each interval to make sure.

1. For \(x < 0\), say \(x = -1\): numerator is \(|1 - 81| = 80\), denominator is \(1 - (-36) = 37\). So, the expression is \(80/37\), which is positive. So, not part of the solution.

2. For \(0 < x < 9\), say \(x = 1\): numerator is \(|1 - 81| = 80\), denominator is \(1 - 36 = -35\). So, the expression is \(80/(-35)\), which is negative. So, this interval is part of the solution.

3. For \(9 < x < 36\), say \(x = 10\): numerator is \(|100 - 81| = 19\), denominator is \(100 - 360 = -260\). So, the expression is \(19/(-260)\), which is negative. So, this interval is part of the solution.

4. For \(x > 36\), say \(x = 37\): numerator is \(|1369 - 81| = 1288\), denominator is \(1369 - 1332 = 37\). So, the expression is \(1288/37\), which is positive. So, not part of the solution.

Therefore, the solution is indeed \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\), which is \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

But wait, I should also check if the numerator is zero at \(x = 9\), which makes the entire expression zero, so it's not included. So, yes, that's correct.

So, the final answer is \(x\) in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \(\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}\).
</think>

To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we start by analyzing the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is always non-negative. It is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).
2. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which factors to \(x(x - 36)\). This is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), making the expression undefined at these points.

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) simplifies to finding where the denominator is negative because the numerator is non-negative. 

We analyze the sign of the denominator \(x(x - 36)\):
- For \(x < 0\), the denominator is positive.
- For \(0 < x < 36\), the denominator is negative.
- For \(x > 36\), the denominator is positive.

Thus, the denominator is negative in the interval \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), we only exclude \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution is the interval \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\), which is written as \((0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular field that's enclosed within an athletic track. The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters, and I need to find the maximum possible area of the field. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the Asymptote code draws a rectangle with two semicircular ends. So, the track is like a rectangle with semicircles on each end, right? That makes the track kind of a running track shape, which I think is called a running track or a athletics track. So, the field inside is a rectangle, and the track around it has two straight sides and two semicircular ends.

The total length of the track is 400 meters. I need to figure out the dimensions of the rectangle that would maximize the area inside. So, this sounds like an optimization problem where I need to maximize the area given a constraint on the perimeter.

Let me denote the length of the straight sides of the track as 'L' and the width of the rectangle as 'W'. But wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is drawn from (0,0) to (3,0) to (3,2) to (0,2), so the length is 3 units and the width is 2 units. But in the problem, the actual length is 400 meters. So, maybe I need to adjust my variables accordingly.

Wait, no, the Asymptote code is just an illustration, not to scale. So, I shouldn't rely on those specific numbers. Instead, I should think about the general case.

So, the track has two straight sides, each of length 'L', and two semicircular ends. Each semicircle has a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 'W'. So, the circumference of a full circle would be π*W, but since we have two semicircles, that's equivalent to one full circle. So, the total length of the track is the sum of the two straight sides and the circumference of the two semicircles.

Therefore, the total length of the track is 2L + π*W = 400 meters. That's our constraint.

Now, the area of the field is the area of the rectangle, which is L multiplied by W. So, A = L*W. We need to maximize A given that 2L + π*W = 400.

This is a classic optimization problem where we can use calculus to find the maximum. Let me set up the equations.

First, express L in terms of W using the constraint:

2L + π*W = 400

So, 2L = 400 - π*W

Therefore, L = (400 - π*W)/2

Now, substitute this into the area formula:

A = L*W = [(400 - π*W)/2] * W = (400W - π*W²)/2

So, A = (400W - π*W²)/2

Now, to find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of A with respect to W and set it equal to zero.

Let me compute dA/dW:

dA/dW = (400 - 2π*W)/2 = 200 - π*W

Set this equal to zero for critical points:

200 - π*W = 0

So, π*W = 200

Therefore, W = 200/π

Now, let's find L using the earlier expression:

L = (400 - π*W)/2

Substitute W = 200/π:

L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100

So, L = 100 meters and W = 200/π meters.

Now, let's compute the area:

A = L*W = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π

Hmm, that seems straightforward. But wait, let me double-check my steps.

1. I defined L as the length of the straight side and W as the width, which is the diameter of the semicircles. So, the circumference contributed by the semicircles is π*W, which is correct because two semicircles make a full circle.

2. The total length of the track is 2L + π*W = 400. That seems right.

3. Expressed L in terms of W: L = (400 - π*W)/2. Correct.

4. Substituted into area: A = L*W = (400W - π*W²)/2. Correct.

5. Took derivative: dA/dW = (400 - 2π*W)/2 = 200 - π*W. Correct.

6. Set derivative to zero: 200 - π*W = 0 => W = 200/π. Correct.

7. Then L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 100. Correct.

8. Area A = 100*(200/π) = 20000/π. That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think about whether this is indeed the maximum. Since the second derivative of A with respect to W is negative, that would confirm it's a maximum.

Compute the second derivative:

d²A/dW² = -π

Since π is positive, the second derivative is negative, which means the function is concave down, so this critical point is indeed a maximum. So, that's good.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

But let me just think about whether I interpreted the problem correctly. The track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. So, the total length is 2L + 2*(π*r), where r is the radius of the semicircles. But wait, in my initial setup, I considered the diameter as W, so the radius would be W/2. Therefore, the circumference of the two semicircles is 2*(π*(W/2)) = π*W. So, that's correct.

Alternatively, if I had considered the radius as r, then W = 2r, and the total length would be 2L + 2*(π*r) = 2L + π*W, which is the same as before. So, either way, the equation is consistent.

Therefore, my calculations seem correct.

So, the maximum area is 20000 divided by π, which is approximately 6366.1977 square meters, but since the question asks for the exact value, I should leave it in terms of π.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π m².

Wait, but let me just think again. Is there another way to model this? Maybe if the track is considered as a rectangle with semicircular ends, sometimes the inner edge is considered, but in this case, the problem says the track is made up of two straight sides and two semicircles, so I think my model is correct.

Alternatively, sometimes in athletics tracks, the inner edge is a certain distance from the outer edge, but in this problem, it's just the track itself, so I think my initial approach is correct.

So, yeah, I think 20000/π is the correct maximum area.

**Final Answer**
The maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.
</think>

The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field enclosed within an athletic track. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends, with a total length of 400 meters.

1. Define the length of the straight sides as \( L \) and the width of the rectangle (diameter of the semicircles) as \( W \).
2. The total length of the track is given by the equation:
   \[
   2L + \pi W = 400
   \]
3. Express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
   \[
   L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
   \]
4. The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is:
   \[
   A = L \times W = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2}
   \]
5. To maximize the area, take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dW} = \frac{400 - 2\pi W}{2} = 200 - \pi W = 0
   \]
6. Solving for \( W \):
   \[
   \pi W = 200 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
   \]
7. Substitute \( W \) back into the expression for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
   \]
8. Calculate the maximum area:
   \[
   A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
   \]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.","[20000/pi, '\\frac{20000}{\\pi}']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"Okay, so I have this triangle RST, and it's a right triangle because there's a right angle at S. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, RS is the vertical side from (2,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), which means RS has a length of sqrt(21). ST is the horizontal side from (0,0) to (2,0), so that's length 2. RT is the hypotenuse from (0,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), and the Asymptote code labels it as 5. Let me verify that.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, the hypotenuse RT should be sqrt(RS² + ST²). RS is sqrt(21), so RS² is 21. ST is 2, so ST² is 4. Adding them together, 21 + 4 is 25, and the square root of 25 is 5. Okay, that checks out. So RT is indeed 5 units long.

The problem says that sin R is 2/5, and we need to find sin T. Let me recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, which is at point R, the opposite side would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT. Wait, let me make sure.

In triangle RST, angle R is at point R, so the sides relative to angle R are: the opposite side is ST, the adjacent side is RS, and the hypotenuse is RT. So, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST / RT. Given that sin R is 2/5, and RT is 5, then ST must be 2. That matches with the coordinates given, since ST is from (0,0) to (2,0), which is length 2. So that makes sense.

Now, we need to find sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is the right angle? Wait, no, the right angle is at S. So angle T is at (0,0), which is a different angle. Let me visualize the triangle again. Point T is at the origin, S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, angle T is at the origin, between sides ST and RT.

In triangle RST, angle T is opposite side RS and adjacent to side ST. So, for angle T, the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. Therefore, sin T should be opposite over hypotenuse, which is RS / RT.

So, sin T = RS / RT = sqrt(21) / 5. Let me write that as sqrt(21)/5. Is that the simplest form? Well, sqrt(21) can't be simplified further, so yes, that should be the value.

Wait, let me double-check. Since angle T is at the origin, the sides adjacent to it are ST (length 2) and RT (length 5). The side opposite angle T is RS (length sqrt(21)). So, yes, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, which is sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, I can think about the triangle in terms of coordinates. Point T is (0,0), S is (2,0), R is (2, sqrt(21)). So, vector RT is from T(0,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)), which has components (2, sqrt(21)). The length of RT is 5, as we saw earlier. The sine of angle T would be the y-component over the length of RT, which is sqrt(21)/5. That's consistent with what I found before.

So, I think that's the correct answer. Let me just recap:

- Triangle RST is right-angled at S.
- RT is the hypotenuse with length 5.
- sin R = 2/5, which corresponds to ST (opposite side) over RT (hypotenuse), so ST = 2.
- Therefore, RS must be sqrt(21) because of the Pythagorean theorem.
- For angle T, the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21), so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Yep, that all adds up. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the value of sin T is sqrt(21)/5.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.
</think>

Given the right triangle \( \triangle RST \) with a right angle at \( S \), we know the following:

- The coordinates of the points are \( T(0,0) \), \( S(2,0) \), and \( R(2, \sqrt{21}) \).
- The hypotenuse \( RT \) is 5 units long.
- \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \).

To find \( \sin{T} \):

1. Verify the lengths of the sides using the Pythagorean theorem:
   - \( RS \) is the vertical side from \( (2,0) \) to \( (2, \sqrt{21}) \), so \( RS = \sqrt{21} \).
   - \( ST \) is the horizontal side from \( (0,0) \) to \( (2,0) \), so \( ST = 2 \).
   - The hypotenuse \( RT \) is 5, which is confirmed by \( \sqrt{RS^2 + ST^2} = \sqrt{21 + 4} = \sqrt{25} = 5 \).

2. For angle \( R \), the opposite side is \( ST \) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \). Given \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \), this confirms \( ST = 2 \).

3. For angle \( T \), the opposite side is \( RS \) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \). Therefore, \( \sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \).

Thus, the value of \( \sin{T} \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimal distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The answer should be expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) isn't divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Then, I need to find \( a + b \).

Hmm, let me think. The distance from the origin to any point \( (x, y) \) is given by the distance formula, right? So, the distance \( D \) would be \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since we're looking for the minimal distance, I can probably minimize the square of the distance to make the calculations easier, because the square root function is monotonically increasing. So, minimizing \( D^2 = x^2 + y^2 \) should give the same result as minimizing \( D \).

Given the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), I can substitute this into the distance squared formula. Let me write that out:

\( D^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \)

Simplify that expression. First, square the \( y \) term:

\( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

So, substituting back into \( D^2 \):

\( D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

Now, let me expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \)

So, plugging that back in:

\( D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \)

Let me distribute the \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\( D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

Combine like terms:

\( D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 + (x^2 - 3x^2) + \frac{9}{2} \)
\( D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

Okay, so now I have \( D^2 \) as a function of \( x \). To find the minimum, I need to take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it equal to zero.

Let me compute the derivative \( D^2' \):

\( D^2' = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) \)
\( D^2' = 2x^3 - 4x \)

Set this equal to zero to find critical points:

\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \)
Factor out 2x:

\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \)

So, the critical points are at \( x = 0 \) and \( x^2 = 2 \), which gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimal distance. Let's evaluate \( D^2 \) at each of these points.

First, at \( x = 0 \):

\( D^2 = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \)
So, \( D = \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Next, at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

Compute \( D^2 \):

\( D^2 = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)
Simplify each term:

\( (\sqrt{2})^4 = (2)^{2} = 4 \)
\( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \)

So,

\( D^2 = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} \)
\( D^2 = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} \)
Convert to halves:

\( 2 = \frac{4}{2} \), \( 4 = \frac{8}{2} \)
So,

\( D^2 = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4 - 8 + 9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \)
Thus, \( D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \)

Similarly, at \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), since the function is even (symmetric about the y-axis), the distance will be the same as at \( x = \sqrt{2} \). So, \( D = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \) as well.

Now, comparing the distances at the critical points:

At \( x = 0 \), \( D = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx 2.121 \)
At \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), \( D = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \approx 1.581 \)

So, clearly, the minimal distance occurs at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), and the minimal distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

Wait, but let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when taking derivatives, especially with higher-degree polynomials, it's easy to make a mistake.

So, starting again, the function is \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The distance squared is \( x^2 + y^2 \), which is \( x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \). Expanding that gives \( x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \), which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). Taking the derivative, \( 2x^3 - 4x \), setting to zero, gives \( x(2x^2 - 4) = 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) or \( x^2 = 2 \). So, that seems correct.

Evaluating at \( x = 0 \), we get \( D^2 = \frac{9}{2} \), which is correct. At \( x = \sqrt{2} \), plugging back in:

\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}( (\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 ) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

So, the point is \( (\sqrt{2}, -1/\sqrt{2}) \). The distance squared is \( (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 + 1/2 = 5/2 \). So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{5/2} \), which is \( \sqrt{10}/2 \). So, expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \), we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). But wait, the problem says \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) shouldn't be divisible by the square of any integer greater than one. Let's check \( a = 10 \). The prime factors of 10 are 2 and 5, neither of which are squared, so that's fine.

Therefore, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \).

Wait, hold on, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in simplifying \( \sqrt{5/2} \). Because \( \sqrt{5/2} \) is equal to \( \sqrt{10}/2 \), right? Because \( \sqrt{5/2} = \sqrt{5}/\sqrt{2} = (\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2}) / (\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}) ) = \sqrt{10}/2 \). So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is using calculus. The minimal distance occurs where the line from the origin to the point on the curve is perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point. So, maybe I can approach it that way as a check.

The slope of the tangent to the curve at any point \( x \) is given by the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \). So, \( dy/dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \sqrt{2}x \).

The slope of the line from the origin to the point \( (x, y) \) is \( y/x \). For these two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes should be \( -1 \). So,

\( (\sqrt{2}x) \cdot (y/x) = -1 \)
Simplify:

\( \sqrt{2}y = -1 \)
So, \( y = -1/\sqrt{2} \)

But from the original equation, \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). So,

\( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) = -1/\sqrt{2} \)
Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\( x^2 - 3 = -1 \)
So, \( x^2 = 2 \), which gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). So, this confirms the critical points we found earlier.

Therefore, the minimal distance is indeed at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), giving \( y = -1/\sqrt{2} \). The distance is \( \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-1/\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 1/2} = \sqrt{5/2} = \sqrt{10}/2 \).

So, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I approached it both by minimizing the distance squared and by using the geometric condition of perpendicularity, and both methods led me to the same result. So, I'm confident that the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{10}/2 \), and thus \( a + b = 12 \).

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{12}.
</think>

To find the minimal distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance squared from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance squared \( D^2 \) is given by:

\[ D^2 = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]

Expanding and substituting back:

\[ D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \]
\[ D^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( D^2 \) with respect to \( x \):

\[ \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) = 2x^3 - 4x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero:

\[ 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives the critical points \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Evaluating \( D^2 \) at these points:

- At \( x = 0 \):
  \[ D^2 = \frac{9}{2} \]
  \[ D = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

- At \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
  \[ D^2 = \frac{5}{2} \]
  \[ D = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

The minimal distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), which can be expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \) with \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 12 \).

"Okay, so I have this function f defined piecewise, and I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, let me write down the function first to make sure I understand it correctly.

The function f(x) is defined as:
- 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3,
- -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function with two different expressions depending on whether x is less than or equal to 3 or greater than 3. I need to find the inverses at 0 and 6, then add them together.

First, let me recall what an inverse function does. The inverse function f⁻¹(y) gives me the x such that f(x) = y. So, to find f⁻¹(0), I need to solve f(x) = 0, and similarly for f⁻¹(6), solve f(x) = 6.

Since f is piecewise, I need to check both pieces for each equation.

Starting with f⁻¹(0):

Case 1: x ≤ 3. Then f(x) = 3 - x. So, set 3 - x = 0. Solving for x, I get x = 3. But wait, x has to be ≤ 3, so x = 3 is valid here. So, f(3) = 0, which means f⁻¹(0) = 3.

But hold on, I should also check the other piece to make sure there isn't another solution. So, Case 2: x > 3. Then f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's set that equal to 0:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0.

Factor out an x:

x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0.

So, x = 0 or -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

But x = 0 is not in the domain x > 3, so we can ignore that. Now, solve -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

x² - 2x - 3 = 0.

Factor this quadratic:

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, 1 and -3? Yes, because 1 * (-3) = -3 and 1 + (-3) = -2.

So, (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0.

Thus, x = 3 or x = -1.

But again, x must be greater than 3, so x = 3 is the boundary, but in this case, x > 3, so x = 3 is not included here. x = -1 is less than 3, so it's not in the domain of this piece either. Therefore, in the x > 3 case, there is no solution for f(x) = 0. So, the only solution is x = 3 from the first piece.

Therefore, f⁻¹(0) = 3.

Now, moving on to f⁻¹(6). Again, I need to solve f(x) = 6.

First, check the first piece: x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x.

Set 3 - x = 6.

Solving for x: -x = 6 - 3 => -x = 3 => x = -3.

Is x = -3 ≤ 3? Yes, it is. So, that's a valid solution. So, f(-3) = 6, meaning f⁻¹(6) = -3.

But again, I should check the other piece to ensure there isn't another solution.

Case 2: x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x.

Set this equal to 6:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6.

Bring 6 to the left side:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0.

Let me rewrite this as:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0.

Hmm, solving a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor this. Let me try to factor by grouping or look for rational roots.

Rational Root Theorem suggests possible roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Let me test x = 1:

-1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = (-1 + 2) + (3 - 6) = 1 - 3 = -2 ≠ 0.

x = 2:

-8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = (-8 + 8) + (6 - 6) = 0 + 0 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root.

So, (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide -x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 by (x - 2).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: -1, 2, 3, -6

Bring down -1.

Multiply by 2: -1 * 2 = -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.

Multiply by 2: 0 * 2 = 0. Add to next coefficient: 3 + 0 = 3.

Multiply by 2: 3 * 2 = 6. Add to last coefficient: -6 + 6 = 0.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(-x² + 0x + 3) = (x - 2)(-x² + 3).

So, the equation becomes:

(x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0.

Set each factor equal to zero:

x - 2 = 0 => x = 2.

-x² + 3 = 0 => x² = 3 => x = ±√3.

So, the roots are x = 2, x = √3, x = -√3.

But in this case, we're looking for x > 3. So, x = 2 is less than 3, so not in the domain. x = √3 is approximately 1.732, which is also less than 3. x = -√3 is negative, so also less than 3. Therefore, none of these roots are in the domain x > 3. So, in the second piece, there is no solution for f(x) = 6.

Therefore, the only solution is x = -3 from the first piece.

So, f⁻¹(6) = -3.

Therefore, f⁻¹(0) + f⁻¹(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my work.

For f⁻¹(0):

First piece: 3 - x = 0 => x = 3. Correct.

Second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Factored as x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. Solutions x = 0, x = 3, x = -1. None of these are greater than 3 except x = 3, but x > 3, so no solution. So, only x = 3. Correct.

For f⁻¹(6):

First piece: 3 - x = 6 => x = -3. Correct.

Second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Factored as (x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0. Solutions x = 2, x = √3, x = -√3. All less than 3, so no solution in x > 3. Correct.

Therefore, f⁻¹(0) = 3, f⁻¹(6) = -3. Sum is 0.

Wait, but let me think again. Is f invertible? Because for a function to have an inverse, it needs to be bijective, meaning it's both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto). Since f is piecewise, I should check if it's strictly increasing or decreasing in each piece, and whether the pieces connect without overlapping.

Looking at the first piece: f(x) = 3 - x for x ≤ 3. This is a linear function with slope -1, so it's strictly decreasing. So, it's one-to-one on its domain.

The second piece: f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x for x > 3. Let's check its behavior. Let's compute its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.

f'(x) = derivative of -x³ + 2x² + 3x is -3x² + 4x + 3.

We can analyze the derivative for x > 3.

At x = 3: f'(3) = -27 + 12 + 3 = -12. So, negative slope at x = 3.

As x increases beyond 3, the term -3x² dominates, so the derivative becomes more negative. Therefore, the function is decreasing for x > 3.

So, both pieces are strictly decreasing. Now, check the continuity at x = 3.

Compute the left-hand limit as x approaches 3 from below: f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0.

Compute the right-hand limit as x approaches 3 from above: f(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, it's continuous at x = 3.

Since both pieces are strictly decreasing and continuous at the boundary, the entire function f is strictly decreasing over its entire domain. Therefore, f is bijective, so it has an inverse function.

Therefore, my earlier calculations are correct because the function is indeed invertible, and each y value corresponds to exactly one x.

So, f⁻¹(0) = 3 and f⁻¹(6) = -3, so their sum is 0.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0}
</think>

To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) for the piecewise function \( f \) defined as:

\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3 - x & \text{pokud } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{pokud } x > 3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

we need to solve for \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. **Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), solve \( 3 - x = 0 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
   - For \( x > 3 \), solve \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \):
     \[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0. \]
     Solving \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) gives \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \), neither of which are greater than 3. Thus, no solution in this piece.
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), solve \( 3 - x = 6 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
   - For \( x > 3 \), solve \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \):
     \[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
     Factoring gives \( (x - 2)(-x^2 + 3) = 0 \), leading to solutions \( x = 2 \), \( x = \sqrt{3} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \), none of which are greater than 3. Thus, no solution in this piece.
   - Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results, we get:
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a point P and a regular octahedron. The distances from P to five of the octahedron's vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular octahedron has six vertices, so this makes sense.

First, let me recall what a regular octahedron looks like. It's a Platonic solid with eight triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. It can be thought of as two square pyramids glued together at their square bases. Each vertex is equidistant from the center, right? So, all the vertices lie on a sphere centered at the octahedron's center.

Now, the point P is somewhere in space, and we know its distances to five of the six vertices. I need to find the sixth distance. I wonder if there's a relationship or formula that connects these distances. Maybe something related to the properties of the octahedron or the coordinates of the points.

Let me think about coordinates. If I place the octahedron in a coordinate system, it might be easier to handle. A regular octahedron can be centered at the origin with vertices along the axes. So, the six vertices would be at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), and (0, 0, ±1). Is that right? Let me confirm: yes, that's a standard embedding of a regular octahedron in 3D space.

So, if the octahedron is centered at the origin, each vertex is at a distance of 1 from the origin. But in this problem, the distances from P to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and the unknown one. So, P is some point in space, not necessarily at the origin.

Wait, maybe I can use the concept of the sum of squares of distances from a point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron. I remember that for a regular polyhedron, there's a formula that relates the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices. Let me try to recall.

I think the formula is something like the sum of the squares of the distances from a point P to all the vertices of a regular polyhedron is equal to n times the square of the distance from P to the center plus some constant term related to the polyhedron's geometry. Let me see if I can derive it or recall it correctly.

For a regular octahedron, which has six vertices, each at a distance of 1 from the center (assuming it's unit-ed). Let me denote the center as O. Then, for any point P, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to O plus 6 times the square of the distance from O to each vertex.

Wait, is that right? Let me think. If I have a point P, and O is the center, then for each vertex V_i, the distance PV_i can be expressed using the law of cosines in triangle POV_i. So, PV_i² = PO² + OV_i² - 2 * PO * OV_i * cos(theta_i), where theta_i is the angle between PO and OV_i.

But since the octahedron is regular, all OV_i are equal, say of length a. So, OV_i = a for all i. Then, PV_i² = PO² + a² - 2 * PO * a * cos(theta_i). If I sum this over all six vertices, I get sum(PV_i²) = 6 * PO² + 6 * a² - 2 * a * PO * sum(cos(theta_i)).

Now, what is sum(cos(theta_i))? Since the octahedron is symmetric, the sum of the cosines of the angles from P to each vertex might have some nice property. Wait, in a regular octahedron, the vectors from the center to each vertex are symmetric. So, if I consider the vectors OV_i, their sum is zero because of symmetry. Therefore, the sum of the unit vectors in the direction of each OV_i is zero.

But in our case, we have cos(theta_i), which is the dot product of the unit vector in the direction of OV_i and the unit vector in the direction of PO. So, sum(cos(theta_i)) is equal to the dot product of PO with the sum of the unit vectors OV_i. But since the sum of the unit vectors OV_i is zero, this sum is zero. Therefore, sum(cos(theta_i)) = 0.

So, that simplifies the equation: sum(PV_i²) = 6 * PO² + 6 * a².

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each vertex is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the center plus 6 times the square of the distance from the center to each vertex.

In our case, the octahedron is regular, so all OV_i are equal. If we assume the octahedron is centered at the origin, then a is the distance from the center to each vertex, which is 1 in the standard embedding. But in our problem, the distances from P to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and an unknown. So, let's denote the unknown distance as x.

Therefore, the sum of the squares is 3² + 7² + 8² + 9² + 11² + x². Let me compute that:

3² = 9

7² = 49

8² = 64

9² = 81

11² = 121

So, summing these: 9 + 49 = 58; 58 + 64 = 122; 122 + 81 = 203; 203 + 121 = 324. So, the sum of the known squares is 324, and then plus x².

So, sum(PV_i²) = 324 + x².

On the other hand, according to the formula, this is equal to 6 * PO² + 6 * a².

But wait, in our case, is the octahedron scaled? Because in the standard embedding, a = 1, but in the problem, the distances from P are 3, 7, etc., which are larger. So, maybe the octahedron is scaled by some factor.

Wait, hold on. The problem says it's a regular octahedron, but it doesn't specify the edge length or the distance from the center to the vertices. So, perhaps I need to consider that the octahedron is scaled such that the distance from the center to each vertex is some value, say, r. Then, a = r.

But in the standard embedding, a = 1, but in our problem, the distances from P are given, so maybe the octahedron is scaled such that a is not 1. Hmm, but without knowing the scaling, how can I proceed?

Wait, maybe I can express everything in terms of a. Let me denote the distance from P to the center as d. Then, according to the formula, sum(PV_i²) = 6d² + 6a².

But I don't know a or d. However, maybe I can find a relationship between them.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the fact that in the standard embedding, the distance from the center to each vertex is 1, but in our case, it's scaled by some factor. Let me denote the scaling factor as k. So, each OV_i = k * 1 = k. Then, the formula becomes sum(PV_i²) = 6d² + 6k².

But I still don't know k or d. Hmm, this seems like two variables. Maybe I need another equation.

Wait, but in the standard embedding, the edge length is sqrt(2), because the distance between two adjacent vertices is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + (0-0)^2] = sqrt(2). But in our scaled octahedron, the edge length would be k * sqrt(2). But I don't know the edge length either.

Hmm, maybe I need a different approach. Let me think about the coordinates.

Suppose the octahedron is centered at the origin, with vertices at (±k, 0, 0), (0, ±k, 0), (0, 0, ±k). Then, point P has coordinates (x, y, z). The distance from P to each vertex is sqrt[(x ± k)^2 + y^2 + z^2], sqrt[x^2 + (y ± k)^2 + z^2], sqrt[x^2 + y^2 + (z ± k)^2].

So, the squares of these distances are:

(x + k)^2 + y^2 + z^2,

(x - k)^2 + y^2 + z^2,

x^2 + (y + k)^2 + z^2,

x^2 + (y - k)^2 + z^2,

x^2 + y^2 + (z + k)^2,

x^2 + y^2 + (z - k)^2.

If I sum all these squared distances, I get:

[(x + k)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x - k)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + k)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y - k)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + k)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z - k)^2].

Let me compute this:

First, expand each term:

1. (x + k)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x² + 2xk + k² + y² + z²

2. (x - k)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x² - 2xk + k² + y² + z²

3. x² + (y + k)^2 + z² = x² + y² + 2yk + k² + z²

4. x² + (y - k)^2 + z² = x² + y² - 2yk + k² + z²

5. x² + y² + (z + k)^2 = x² + y² + z² + 2zk + k²

6. x² + y² + (z - k)^2 = x² + y² + z² - 2zk + k²

Now, sum all these:

Let's add up the x² terms: 1 has x², 2 has x², 3 has x², 4 has x², 5 has x², 6 has x². So, 6x².

Similarly, y² terms: 1 has y², 2 has y², 3 has y², 4 has y², 5 has y², 6 has y². So, 6y².

Similarly, z² terms: 1 has z², 2 has z², 3 has z², 4 has z², 5 has z², 6 has z². So, 6z².

Now, the cross terms:

From 1: +2xk

From 2: -2xk

From 3: +2yk

From 4: -2yk

From 5: +2zk

From 6: -2zk

So, adding these: 2xk - 2xk + 2yk - 2yk + 2zk - 2zk = 0.

Now, the constants:

Each term has a k², and there are six terms, so 6k².

Therefore, the total sum is 6x² + 6y² + 6z² + 6k².

Factor out the 6: 6(x² + y² + z² + k²).

But x² + y² + z² is the square of the distance from P to the center, which is d². So, sum(PV_i²) = 6(d² + k²).

Which matches the formula I thought earlier: sum(PV_i²) = 6d² + 6k².

So, in our problem, sum(PV_i²) = 324 + x² = 6d² + 6k².

But I don't know d or k. Hmm, so I have one equation with two variables. I need another equation.

Wait, maybe I can find another relationship. Let me think about the coordinates again.

Suppose the octahedron is scaled by a factor of k, so the vertices are at (±k, 0, 0), (0, ±k, 0), (0, 0, ±k). Let me denote point P as (a, b, c). Then, the distances from P to the vertices are:

sqrt[(a - k)^2 + b^2 + c^2] = 3,

sqrt[(a + k)^2 + b^2 + c^2] = 7,

sqrt[(a)^2 + (b - k)^2 + c^2] = 8,

sqrt[(a)^2 + (b + k)^2 + c^2] = 9,

sqrt[(a)^2 + b^2 + (c - k)^2] = 11,

sqrt[(a)^2 + b^2 + (c + k)^2] = x.

So, we have six equations:

1. (a - k)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 9,

2. (a + k)^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 49,

3. a^2 + (b - k)^2 + c^2 = 64,

4. a^2 + (b + k)^2 + c^2 = 81,

5. a^2 + b^2 + (c - k)^2 = 121,

6. a^2 + b^2 + (c + k)^2 = x².

So, now I have six equations with variables a, b, c, k, x. That's five variables and six equations, so it's overdetermined, but maybe consistent.

Let me try to subtract some equations to eliminate variables.

First, subtract equation 1 from equation 2:

[(a + k)^2 + b^2 + c^2] - [(a - k)^2 + b^2 + c^2] = 49 - 9 = 40.

Expanding:

(a + k)^2 - (a - k)^2 = 40.

"Okay, so I need to find the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2. Hmm, I remember that the shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance. But I'm a bit fuzzy on the exact formula, so let me think through it step by step.

First, I recall that the formula for the distance from a point (x₀, y₀) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is given by |ax₀ + by₀ + c| divided by the square root of (a² + b²). Is that right? Let me verify. Yeah, I think that's correct. So, I need to write the given line in the standard form ax + by + c = 0.

The given line is y = 2x - 2. To convert this into standard form, I can subtract 2x from both sides and add 2 to both sides. That would give me -2x + y + 2 = 0. Wait, is that right? Let me check: starting from y = 2x - 2, subtract 2x: -2x + y = -2, then add 2: -2x + y + 2 = 0. Yeah, that seems correct. So, in standard form, the line is -2x + y + 2 = 0. Therefore, a = -2, b = 1, and c = 2.

Now, the point is (6, 0), so x₀ = 6 and y₀ = 0. Plugging these into the distance formula: |a*x₀ + b*y₀ + c| / sqrt(a² + b²). Let's compute the numerator first: |-2*6 + 1*0 + 2|. Calculating that: -12 + 0 + 2 = -10. The absolute value of -10 is 10. So the numerator is 10.

Now, the denominator is sqrt(a² + b²). Plugging in a = -2 and b = 1: sqrt((-2)² + 1²) = sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So, the denominator is sqrt(5).

Therefore, the distance is 10 divided by sqrt(5). But wait, I think it's better to rationalize the denominator. So, 10/sqrt(5) can be multiplied by sqrt(5)/sqrt(5) to get (10*sqrt(5))/5, which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5). So, the distance is 2√5.

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the line equation, converting it to standard form: y = 2x - 2 becomes -2x + y + 2 = 0. That seems correct. Then, plugging into the distance formula: |-2*6 + 1*0 + 2| = |-12 + 0 + 2| = |-10| = 10. Denominator: sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5). So, 10/sqrt(5) simplifies to 2√5. Yeah, that looks right.

Alternatively, I can think about this geometrically. The shortest distance is along the perpendicular. The slope of the given line is 2, so the slope of the perpendicular line would be -1/2. So, the equation of the line perpendicular to y = 2x - 2 that passes through (6, 0) would be y - 0 = (-1/2)(x - 6), which simplifies to y = (-1/2)x + 3.

Now, to find the intersection point of these two lines: y = 2x - 2 and y = (-1/2)x + 3. Setting them equal: 2x - 2 = (-1/2)x + 3. Let's solve for x. Multiply both sides by 2 to eliminate the fraction: 4x - 4 = -x + 6. Bring all terms to one side: 4x + x = 6 + 4, so 5x = 10, which gives x = 2. Plugging back into one of the equations, say y = 2x - 2: y = 4 - 2 = 2. So, the intersection point is (2, 2).

Now, the distance between (6, 0) and (2, 2) can be found using the distance formula: sqrt[(6 - 2)² + (0 - 2)²] = sqrt[16 + 4] = sqrt[20] = 2*sqrt(5). That's the same result as before, so it confirms that the distance is indeed 2√5.

I think that's solid. Both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident that 2√5 is correct.

**Final Answer**
The shortest distance is \boxed{2\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we use the formula for the distance from a point \((x_0, y_0)\) to the line \(ax + by + c = 0\), which is given by:

\[
\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
\]

First, we convert the line \(y = 2x - 2\) into standard form. Subtracting \(2x\) from both sides and adding 2 to both sides, we get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(a = -2\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 2\). The point is \((6, 0)\), so \(x_0 = 6\) and \(y_0 = 0\).

Calculating the numerator:

\[
|-2 \cdot 6 + 1 \cdot 0 + 2| = |-12 + 0 + 2| = |-10| = 10
\]

Calculating the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the distance is:

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the set of expressions involving the roots of a quartic equation. The equation is \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \), and the roots are \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4 \). I need to determine the set \( \{ \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \} \). Hmm, okay, so it's a set of three elements, each being the sum of two products of roots. 

First, I remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a quartic equation, Vieta's formulas will give me relationships between the roots. Let me write down the general form of a quartic equation and its Vieta's formulas.

A general quartic equation is \( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0 \). The sums and products of the roots are given by:
- \( \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a \)
- \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b \)
- \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c \)
- \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d \)

In our case, the equation is \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \). Comparing this to the general form, we have \( a = 2 \), \( b = 0 \) (since there's no \( x^2 \) term), \( c = 0 \) (since there's no \( x \) term), and \( d = 2 \).

So applying Vieta's formulas:
1. Sum of roots: \( \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 \)
2. Sum of products two at a time: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \)
3. Sum of products three at a time: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \)
4. Product of all roots: \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \)

Okay, so I need to find the set \( \{ \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \} \). Let me denote these three expressions as \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) respectively. So, \( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), \( S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \), and \( S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \).

I notice that each \( S_i \) is a sum of two products of roots. If I add all three \( S_i \) together, I get \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \). Let's compute this:

\( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \). Wait, that's exactly the sum of products two at a time, which from Vieta is 0. So, \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \).

That's a useful piece of information. So the sum of these three expressions is zero. Now, I need more information to find each individual \( S_i \). Maybe I can find the sum of their squares or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products of these \( S_i \) terms. Let me think. If I can find \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) and \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \), then I can form a cubic equation whose roots are \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). Then, the set \( \{ S_1, S_2, S_3 \} \) would be the roots of that cubic equation, and I can find them.

So, let's try that approach. Let me denote \( S = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), \( P = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \), and \( Q = S_1 S_2 S_3 \). Then, the cubic equation would be \( t^3 - S t^2 + P t - Q = 0 \), which simplifies to \( t^3 + P t - Q = 0 \) since \( S = 0 \).

So, I need to compute \( P \) and \( Q \).

First, let's compute \( P = S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \).

Let me compute each product:

1. \( S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) \)
2. \( S_1 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)
3. \( S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)

This seems complicated, but maybe I can find a pattern or use symmetric sums.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express \( P \) in terms of the known symmetric sums from Vieta's formulas.

Let me try expanding \( S_1 S_2 \):

\( S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) \)
= \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_1 \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4^2 \)

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe instead of expanding each product, I can find a smarter way.

Wait, perhaps I can consider that \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the sums of products of roots two at a time, but grouped differently. Maybe I can relate them to the elementary symmetric sums.

Alternatively, I recall that in quartic equations, the products \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), etc., can sometimes be related to the roots of a resolvent cubic. Maybe that's the case here.

Yes, actually, for quartic equations, the resolvent cubic is formed by considering the sums \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), \( \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \), \( \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \), which are exactly the \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) we're looking for. So, the resolvent cubic has these as roots.

Therefore, if I can find the resolvent cubic, then I can find the set \( \{ S_1, S_2, S_3 \} \).

To find the resolvent cubic, I can use the method for quartic equations. The general quartic equation is \( x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0 \). The resolvent cubic is given by \( t^3 - b t^2 + (ac - 4d) t - a^2 d + 4b d - c^2 = 0 \). Wait, is that correct? I might need to verify.

Alternatively, another formula for the resolvent cubic is \( t^3 - 2b t^2 + (b^2 + ac - 4d) t - a^2 d + 4b d - c^2 = 0 \). Hmm, I might be mixing up different sources.

Wait, perhaps it's better to derive it. Let me try to construct the resolvent cubic.

Given the quartic equation \( x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0 \), let me denote the roots as \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4 \). The resolvent cubic is formed by considering the products \( \alpha_i \alpha_j + \alpha_k \alpha_l \) where \( \{i, j, k, l\} = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \). So, these are exactly the \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \).

To find the resolvent cubic, I can use the method of symmetric polynomials. Let me denote \( S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \), \( S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \), \( S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \).

We already know that \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \).

Now, let's compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \). Let me denote this as \( P \).

To compute \( P \), I can use the identity:

\( (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2(S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3) \)

Since \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \), this simplifies to:

\( 0 = S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 + 2P \)

So, \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = -2P \)

But I don't know \( S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 \) yet. Maybe I can compute it another way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 \) directly.

Let me compute \( S_1 S_2 \):

\( S_1 S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) \)
= \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_1 \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4^2 \)

Similarly, \( S_1 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)
= \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2 \alpha_4 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2^2 \alpha_3 + \alpha_1 \alpha_3 \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2 \alpha_3^2 \alpha_4 \)

And \( S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) \)
= \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1 \alpha_2 \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2 \alpha_3 \alpha_4 \)

Now, adding all these together:

\( S_1 S_2 + S_1 S_3 + S_2 S_3 = \) sum of all these terms.

Let me collect like terms:

Looking at each term:

- Terms with \( \alpha_1^2 \alpha_2 \alpha_3 \): appears in \( S_1 S_2 \) and \( S_1 S_3 \)
- Terms with \( \alpha_1 \alpha_2^2 \alpha_4 \): appears in \( S_1 S_2 \) and \( S_1 S_3 \)

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Let's say AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals AC and BD. So, O is equidistant from all four sides, right?

Given that AB/AD = k, which means the length of AB is k times the length of AD. Let me denote AD as the width and AB as the length for simplicity. So, if AD is the shorter side, then AB is k times longer. But actually, depending on k, it could be either way. Wait, no, since it's a rectangle, AB and AD are adjacent sides, so AB is the length and AD is the width. So, AB is the longer side if k > 1, and shorter if k < 1.

But maybe I should assign some variables to make it concrete. Let me let AD = a, so AB = k*a. Then, the rectangle has length k*a and width a. The center O would then be at ( (k*a)/2, a/2 ) if I place the rectangle in a coordinate system with point A at (0,0). Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is drawn from (-250,100) to (250,100) to (250,-100) to (-250,-100). So, in that case, the center O is at (0,0). So, maybe it's better to center the rectangle at the origin for simplicity.

So, let me define the rectangle with center O at (0,0). Then, the coordinates of the vertices would be: A at (-l, w), B at (l, w), C at (l, -w), and D at (-l, -w), where l is half the length AB, and w is half the width AD. So, AB = 2l, AD = 2w. Then, the ratio AB/AD = (2l)/(2w) = l/w = k. So, l = k*w.

So, the rectangle extends from (-k*w, w) to (k*w, w) to (k*w, -w) to (-k*w, -w). So, the sides are 2k*w in length and 2w in width.

Now, I need to find the region within this rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. Then, the probability would be the area of this region divided by the area of the rectangle.

So, first, let's find the area of the rectangle. It's length times width, which is (2k*w)*(2w) = 4k*w².

Now, the region where a point is closer to O than to any vertex. So, for a point P(x,y) inside the rectangle, the distance to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance to each vertex is sqrt( (x - x_A)² + (y - y_A)² ), and similarly for B, C, D.

So, the condition is that sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt( (x - x_A)² + (y - y_A)² ) for all four vertices A, B, C, D.

But since the rectangle is symmetric, maybe I can just consider one vertex and then the region would be the intersection of all four regions where P is closer to O than to each vertex.

Alternatively, maybe it's easier to find the locus of points equidistant to O and each vertex, and then the region where P is closer to O is the intersection of the regions inside all these loci.

So, let's find the equations of the perpendicular bisectors between O and each vertex.

Let's take vertex A first. The coordinates of A are (-k*w, w). The midpoint between O(0,0) and A(-k*w, w) is (-k*w/2, w/2). The slope of OA is (w - 0)/(-k*w - 0) = -1/k. So, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of k.

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector between O and A is y - w/2 = k(x + k*w/2). Let me write that out:

y = kx + (k²*w)/2 + w/2.

Similarly, for vertex B(k*w, w). The midpoint is (k*w/2, w/2). The slope of OB is (w - 0)/(k*w - 0) = 1/k. So, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of -k.

Equation: y - w/2 = -k(x - k*w/2).

So, y = -kx + (k²*w)/2 + w/2.

Similarly, for vertex C(k*w, -w). Midpoint is (k*w/2, -w/2). Slope of OC is (-w - 0)/(k*w - 0) = -1/k. So, perpendicular bisector slope is k.

Equation: y + w/2 = k(x - k*w/2).

So, y = kx - (k²*w)/2 - w/2.

And for vertex D(-k*w, -w). Midpoint is (-k*w/2, -w/2). Slope of OD is (-w - 0)/(-k*w - 0) = 1/k. So, perpendicular bisector slope is -k.

Equation: y + w/2 = -k(x + k*w/2).

So, y = -kx - (k²*w)/2 - w/2.

So, now we have four lines:

1. From A: y = kx + (k²*w + w)/2
2. From B: y = -kx + (k²*w + w)/2
3. From C: y = kx - (k²*w + w)/2
4. From D: y = -kx - (k²*w + w)/2

These four lines form a diamond (a rotated square) inside the rectangle. The region where the point is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions below the first two lines and above the last two lines.

Wait, let me think. For each vertex, the region closer to O than to that vertex is the region below the perpendicular bisector for A and B, and above the perpendicular bisectors for C and D.

So, the intersection of all four regions would be a polygon bounded by these four lines.

But let me check with one vertex. For vertex A, the region closer to O is below the bisector line y = kx + (k²*w + w)/2. Similarly, for vertex B, it's below y = -kx + (k²*w + w)/2. For vertex C, it's above y = kx - (k²*w + w)/2, and for vertex D, it's above y = -kx - (k²*w + w)/2.

So, the region where P is closer to O than to any vertex is the area bounded by these four lines.

So, to find the area, I need to find the intersection points of these four lines to determine the shape of the region.

Let me find the intersection points.

First, find where the bisector from A intersects the bisector from B.

Set y = kx + (k²*w + w)/2 equal to y = -kx + (k²*w + w)/2.

So, kx + (k²*w + w)/2 = -kx + (k²*w + w)/2

Bring terms together: 2kx = 0 => x = 0.

Then, y = (k²*w + w)/2.

So, the intersection point is (0, (k²*w + w)/2).

Similarly, find where bisector from B intersects bisector from C.

Set y = -kx + (k²*w + w)/2 equal to y = kx - (k²*w + w)/2.

So, -kx + (k²*w + w)/2 = kx - (k²*w + w)/2

Bring terms together: -2kx = - (k²*w + w)

So, x = (k²*w + w)/(2k)

Then, plug back into one of the equations: y = -k*( (k²*w + w)/(2k) ) + (k²*w + w)/2

Simplify: y = - (k²*w + w)/2 + (k²*w + w)/2 = 0.

So, the intersection point is ( (k²*w + w)/(2k), 0 )

Similarly, find where bisector from C intersects bisector from D.

Set y = kx - (k²*w + w)/2 equal to y = -kx - (k²*w + w)/2.

So, kx - (k²*w + w)/2 = -kx - (k²*w + w)/2

Bring terms together: 2kx = 0 => x = 0.

Then, y = - (k²*w + w)/2.

So, intersection point is (0, - (k²*w + w)/2 )

Lastly, find where bisector from D intersects bisector from A.

Set y = -kx - (k²*w + w)/2 equal to y = kx + (k²*w + w)/2.

So, -kx - (k²*w + w)/2 = kx + (k²*w + w)/2

Bring terms together: -2kx = (k²*w + w)

So, x = - (k²*w + w)/(2k)

Then, plug back into one of the equations: y = -k*(- (k²*w + w)/(2k)) - (k²*w + w)/2

Simplify: y = (k²*w + w)/2 - (k²*w + w)/2 = 0.

So, intersection point is ( - (k²*w + w)/(2k), 0 )

So, now we have four intersection points:

1. (0, (k²*w + w)/2 )
2. ( (k²*w + w)/(2k), 0 )
3. (0, - (k²*w + w)/2 )
4. ( - (k²*w + w)/(2k), 0 )

So, these four points form a diamond shape centered at O. The diamond has vertices at these four points.

Now, to find the area of this diamond, we can note that it's a rhombus with diagonals along the x and y axes.

The length of the vertical diagonal is from (0, (k²*w + w)/2 ) to (0, - (k²*w + w)/2 ), so that's (k²*w + w).

The length of the horizontal diagonal is from ( (k²*w + w)/(2k), 0 ) to ( - (k²*w + w)/(2k), 0 ), so that's (k²*w + w)/k.

The area of a rhombus is (d1*d2)/2, so:

Area = [ (k²*w + w) * ( (k²*w + w)/k ) ] / 2

Simplify:

= [ (k²*w + w)^2 / k ] / 2

= (k²*w + w)^2 / (2k)

But let's factor out w from (k²*w + w):

= [ w(k² + 1) ]^2 / (2k )

= w²(k² + 1)^2 / (2k )

So, the area of the region where P is closer to O than to any vertex is w²(k² + 1)^2 / (2k )

But wait, hold on. Is this correct? Because the diamond might be entirely inside the rectangle, but we need to make sure that the diamond doesn't extend beyond the rectangle.

Wait, the rectangle has width 2w and length 2k*w. The diamond's vertical diagonal is (k² + 1)*w, and the horizontal diagonal is (k² + 1)*w / k.

So, let's check if these diagonals are less than the rectangle's dimensions.

Vertical diagonal: (k² + 1)*w. The rectangle's height is 2w. So, (k² + 1)*w must be less than or equal to 2w. So, (k² + 1) <= 2 => k² <=1 => |k| <=1. But k is a ratio of lengths, so k >0. So, if k <=1, then the vertical diagonal is <= 2w, which is the height of the rectangle. Similarly, the horizontal diagonal is (k² +1)*w /k. The rectangle's width is 2k*w. So, (k² +1)*w /k <= 2k*w => (k² +1)/k <= 2k => k² +1 <= 2k² => 1 <= k² => k >=1.

So, if k >=1, the horizontal diagonal is <= 2k*w, which is the width of the rectangle. But if k <1, then the horizontal diagonal would be larger than 2k*w, meaning the diamond would extend beyond the rectangle's width. Similarly, if k >1, the vertical diagonal would be larger than 2w, meaning the diamond would extend beyond the rectangle's height.

Wait, that can't be. Because the diamond is formed by the intersection of the four regions closer to O than to each vertex, so it must lie entirely within the rectangle. Therefore, perhaps my earlier assumption is wrong, and the region is not the entire diamond but only the part that lies within the rectangle.

Hmm, this complicates things. So, maybe the region is actually a convex polygon whose vertices are the intersection points of the perpendicular bisectors with the rectangle's sides.

Wait, perhaps I need to find where these bisectors intersect the sides of the rectangle, because if the diamond extends beyond the rectangle, then the actual region is the part of the diamond that's inside the rectangle.

So, let's consider the case when k ≠1, because when k=1, the rectangle is a square, and the diamond would fit perfectly inside.

So, for k ≠1, the diamond may extend beyond the rectangle, so the region where P is closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the diamond and the rectangle.

Therefore, I need to find the intersection points of the four bisectors with the rectangle's sides.

Let me consider the bisector from A: y = kx + (k²*w + w)/2.

We need to find where this line intersects the top side of the rectangle, which is y = w.

Set y = w:

"First, I need to evaluate each function argument individually.

For \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), since \( \pi \) is approximately 3.1416, dividing by 3 gives approximately 1.0472, which is less than 4. Therefore, I use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, for \( \sqrt{45} \), the square root of 45 is approximately 6.7082, which is greater than or equal to 4. Thus, I use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Lastly, for \( 8^{2/3} \), calculating this gives \( (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \), which is exactly 4. Since 4 is greater than or equal to 4, I use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

"Okay, so I have this magic square problem here. A magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all the same. The grid is 3x3, and some of the cells are filled with expressions involving n, while others are just numbers. My goal is to find the value of n.

First, let me try to visualize the magic square based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like the grid is divided into cells, and each cell has a label. Let me list out the cells with their respective expressions or numbers.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the grid is labeled as follows:

- The first row (top row) has cells: (0.5, 0.5) labeled ""n-3"", (0.5, 1.5) labeled ""3"", and (0.5, 2.5) labeled ""n+1"".
- The second row has cells: (1.5, 0.5) labeled ""n+2"", (1.5, 1.5) labeled ""2n-9"", and (1.5, 2.5) labeled ""1"".
- The third row has cells: (2.5, 0.5) labeled ""2"", (2.5, 1.5) labeled ""n"", and (2.5, 2.5) labeled ""n-1"".

Wait, actually, hold on. The Asymptote code is a bit confusing because it's using coordinates. Let me parse it correctly. The first set of labels are at positions (0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (0.5, 2.5), which would correspond to the first column, first row; first column, second row; first column, third row? Wait, no, in Asymptote, the coordinates are (x, y), where x increases to the right and y increases upwards. So, (0.5, 0.5) is the center of the first cell in the first row, first column. Similarly, (0.5, 1.5) is the center of the first column, second row, and (0.5, 2.5) is the first column, third row.

Similarly, (1.5, 0.5) is the second column, first row, and so on.

So, reconstructing the grid:

First row (top row):
- Column 1: n - 3
- Column 2: 3
- Column 3: n + 1

Second row:
- Column 1: n + 2
- Column 2: 2n - 9
- Column 3: 1

Third row (bottom row):
- Column 1: 2
- Column 2: n
- Column 3: n - 1

So, the magic square looks like this:

| n - 3 | 3 | n + 1 |
|-------|---|-------|
| n + 2 |2n -9| 1 |
| 2 | n | n - 1 |

Now, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals must add up to the same sum. Let's denote this common sum as S.

So, let's write down the equations based on the rows, columns, and diagonals.

First, let's consider the rows.

1. First row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S
Simplify: n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1 = S

2. Second row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S
Simplify: n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6 = S

3. Third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = S
Simplify: 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1 = S

So, from the first and third rows, we have S = 2n + 1. From the second row, S = 3n - 6. Therefore, we can set these equal to each other:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6

Solving for n:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6  
Subtract 2n from both sides: 1 = n - 6  
Add 6 to both sides: 7 = n

So, n = 7.

Wait, let me verify this because sometimes when solving equations, especially with multiple expressions, it's easy to make a mistake.

Let me plug n = 7 back into the grid and check if all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same sum.

First, calculate S from the first row:

(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15

So, S should be 15.

Now, check the second row:

(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = (7 + 2) + (14 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15. Good.

Third row:

2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15. Perfect.

Now, check the columns.

First column: (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15

Second column: 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15

Third column: (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15

Now, the diagonals.

Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Everything adds up to 15, so n = 7 is correct.

But just to be thorough, let me check if I made any mistakes in setting up the equations.

Looking back, the first row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1. Correct.

Second row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6. Correct.

Third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2n + 1. Correct.

Setting 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 gives n = 7. Correct.

Plugging back in, all sums are 15. So, n is indeed 7.

I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

Given a 3x3 magic square where the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are the same, we need to find the value of \( n \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n - 3 & 3 & n + 1 \\
\hline
n + 2 & 2n - 9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n - 1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, we calculate the sum \( S \) for each row, column, and diagonal.

1. **First row:**
   \[
   (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 = S
   \]

2. **Second row:**
   \[
   (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6 = S
   \]

3. **Third row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n - 1) = 2n + 1 = S
   \]

Setting the expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\
1 = n - 6 \\
n = 7
\]

We verify by substituting \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and checking all rows, columns, and diagonals:

- **Rows:**
  - First row: \( (7 - 3) + 3 + (7 + 1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
  - Second row: \( (7 + 2) + (14 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
  - Third row: \( 2 + 7 + (7 - 1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

- **Columns:**
  - First column: \( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
  - Second column: \( 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
  - Third column: \( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

- **Diagonals:**
  - Main diagonal: \( (7 - 3) + (14 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
  - Other diagonal: \( (7 + 1) + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

All sums are 15, confirming \( n = 7 \) is correct.

"Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². But since ω³ = 1, and we're dealing with complex numbers, ω can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined (since 1 + 1 = 2, which is fine, but wait, actually, if ω is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But maybe ω is not 1? Let me check.

Wait, the problem says ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. So ω can be 1, ω, or ω². But if ω is 1, then the expression becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I think the problem is more interesting if ω is not 1, so maybe we need to consider ω and ω². Let me see.

Alternatively, maybe the expression is the same regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω². Let me test that.

If ω = 1, as I said, the expression is 1. If ω is a primitive cube root of unity, then ω ≠ 1, and ω² is the other root. Let me compute the expression for ω and ω².

But before that, maybe I can simplify the expression algebraically. Let me write it down:

1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

To add these two fractions, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). So the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute the numerator:

(1)(1 + ω²) + (1)(1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².

So the expression becomes (2 + ω + ω²) / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)].

Now, I remember that for cube roots of unity, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. So ω + ω² = -1. Therefore, the numerator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.

So the numerator is 1. Now, let's compute the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²).

Let me expand this: 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³.

But ω³ = 1, so this becomes 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².

Again, since ω + ω² = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.

So the denominator is also 1. Therefore, the entire expression is 1/1 = 1.

Wait, so regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression is 1? But when ω = 1, the expression is 1, and when ω is a primitive root, it's also 1. So the only possible value is 1.

But let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in assuming that ω³ = 1 implies ω + ω² = -1. Let me verify that.

Yes, for cube roots of unity, the sum of all three roots is 0: 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1. That's correct.

So, substituting back, the numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1, and the denominator is also 1, so the expression is 1.

Wait, but when ω = 1, the expression is 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches. So regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression evaluates to 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

But just to be thorough, let me compute it for ω = e^(2πi/3) and ω = e^(4πi/3), which are the primitive cube roots.

Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

First, let me compute 1 + ω and 1 + ω².

For ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2.

So 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Similarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.

So 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Now, let's compute 1/(1 + ω) and 1/(1 + ω²).

First, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). To simplify, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

(1) * (1/2 - i√3/2) / [(1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2)].

The denominator is (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 + 3/4 = 1.

So 1/(1 + ω) = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

(1) * (1/2 + i√3/2) / [(1/2 - i√3/2)(1/2 + i√3/2)].

Again, the denominator is 1, so 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Now, adding them together: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.

So yes, it checks out. The expression equals 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

The expression simplifies to 1 regardless of which cube root of unity ω is.

"Okay, tak jsem se dostal k tomuto problému, kde mám čtyři body A, B, C a D. Každý z nich je spojený nějakými cestami s určitými délkami. Cílem je najít nejkratší vzdálenost, kterou lze urazit, když začnu v libovolném bodě a navštívím ostatní tři body jednou. To zní jako problém otevřené cesty, kde musím navštívit všechny body a najít tu nejkratší možnou trase.

Nejprve si musím pochopit, jak jsou body A, B, C a D navzájem spojené a jaké jsou vzdálenosti mezi nimi. Asymptotový kód mi ukazuje, jaké jsou spoje a jejich délky. Zdá se, že body jsou spojeny takto:

- D je spojeno s B, C a A.
- B je spojeno s D, A a C.
- A je spojeno s D, B a C.
- C je spojeno s D, B a A.

Vzdálenosti jsou:

- D-B: 3
- A-B: 6
- A-C: 6
- D-C: 4
- A-D: 5
- C-B: 5

Takže můžeme si toto znázornit jako graf, kde každý bod je vrchol a cesty jsou hrany s danými váhami (vzdálenostmi).

Problém je tedy hledání nejkratší cesty, která navštíví všechny čtyři body, začínající v libovolném bodě. To je známý jako problém Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), ale v otevřené verzi, kde nezáleží na tom, kde končíme, jen na tom, abychom navštívili všechny body.

Vzhledem k tomu, že jsme jen čtyři body, můžeme vypočítat všechny možné permutace počátečního bodu a pořadí navštěvování ostatních tří a najít tu nejkratší.

Nejprve si vytvoříme seznam všech možných pořadí navštěvování. V každém pořadí začínáme v libovolném bodě a navštívíme ostatní tři. Vzhledem k tomu, že začínáme v libovolném bodě, můžeme si vybrat libovolný bod jako počáteční a poté navštívit ostatní tři v různém pořadí.

Všimněte si, že v každém pořadí musíme navštívit všechny body, a proto musíme urazit tři cesty. V každém pořadí, počet cest bude tři, protože navštívíme tři body po počátečním.

Vzhledem k tomu, že jsou všechny cesty navzájem spojeny, můžeme si vybrat libovolný počáteční bod a poté navštívit ostatní tři v různém pořadí.

Vypočítáme všechny možné permutace pro každý počáteční bod a najdeme tu nejkratší.

Nejprve si vytvoříme tabulku vzdáleností mezi body:

- A-B: 6
- A-C: 6
- A-D: 5
- B-C: 5
- B-D: 3
- C-D: 4

Všimněte si, že vzdálenost mezi dvěma body je stejná v obou směrech, tedy A-B je 6, stejně jako B-A.

Nyní si vezmeme každý počáteční bod a vypočítáme všechny možné trasy.

1. Počáteční bod A:

   a) A -> B -> C -> D
      A-B:6, B-C:5, C-D:4. Celkově: 6+5+4=15

   b) A -> B -> D -> C
      A-B:6, B-D:3, D-C:4. Celkově:6+3+4=13

   c) A -> C -> B -> D
      A-C:6, C-B:5, B-D:3. Celkově:6+5+3=14

   d) A -> C -> D -> B
      A-C:6, C-D:4, D-B:3. Celkově:6+4+3=13

   e) A -> D -> B -> C
      A-D:5, D-B:3, B-C:5. Celkově:5+3+5=13

   f) A -> D -> C -> B
      A-D:5, D-C:4, C-B:5. Celkově:5+4+5=14

   Nejkratší trasy z A jsou 13, existuje několik variant: A-B-D-C, A-C-D-B, A-D-B-C.

2. Počáteční bod B:

   a) B -> A -> C -> D
      B-A:6, A-C:6, C-D:4. Celkově:6+6+4=16

   b) B -> A -> D -> C
      B-A:6, A-D:5, D-C:4. Celkově:6+5+4=15

   c) B -> C -> A -> D
      B-C:5, C-A:6, A-D:5. Celkově:5+6+5=16

   d) B -> C -> D -> A
      B-C:5, C-D:4, D-A:5. Celkově:5+4+5=14

   e) B -> D -> A -> C
      B-D:3, D-A:5, A-C:6. Celkově:3+5+6=14

   f) B -> D -> C -> A
      B-D:3, D-C:4, C-A:6. Celkově:3+4+6=13

   Nejkratší trasy z B jsou 13: B-D-C-A.

3. Počáteční bod C:

   a) C -> A -> B -> D
      C-A:6, A-B:6, B-D:3. Celkově:6+6+3=15

   b) C -> A -> D -> B
      C-A:6, A-D:5, D-B:3. Celkově:6+5+3=14

   c) C -> B -> A -> D
      C-B:5, B-A:6, A-D:5. Celkově:5+6+5=16

   d) C -> B -> D -> A
      C-B:5, B-D:3, D-A:5. Celkově:5+3+5=13

   e) C -> D -> A -> B
      C-D:4, D-A:5, A-B:6. Celkově:4+5+6=15

   f) C -> D -> B -> A
      C-D:4, D-B:3, B-A:6. Celkově:4+3+6=13

   Nejkratší trasy z C jsou 13: C-B-D-A, C-D-B-A.

4. Počáteční bod D:

   a) D -> A -> B -> C
      D-A:5, A-B:6, B-C:5. Celkově:5+6+5=16

   b) D -> A -> C -> B
      D-A:5, A-C:6, C-B:5. Celkově:5+6+5=16

   c) D -> B -> A -> C
      D-B:3, B-A:6, A-C:6. Celkově:3+6+6=15

   d) D -> B -> C -> A
      D-B:3, B-C:5, C-A:6. Celkově:3+5+6=14

   e) D -> C -> A -> B
      D-C:4, C-A:6, A-B:6. Celkově:4+6+6=16

   f) D -> C -> B -> A
      D-C:4, C-B:5, B-A:6. Celkově:4+5+6=15

   Nejkratší trasy z D jsou 14: D-B-C-A, D-C-B-A.

Nyní si prohlédneme všechny možné nejkratší trasy:

- Z A: 13
- Z B: 13
- Z C: 13
- Z D: 14

Vidíme, že nejkratší trasy jsou 13, a existují několik variant, jak ji dosáhnout. Například:

- A -> B -> D -> C: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
- A -> C -> D -> B: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
- B -> D -> C -> A: 3 + 4 + 5 = 12? Čekáme, 3+4+5=12? Ne, 3+4=7, 7+5=12? Ne, 3+4+5=12? To by bylo 12, ale výpočet byl 3+4+5=12? Ne, 3+4=7, 7+5=12? To by bylo 12, ale výpočet byl 3+4+5=12?
