"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the length of DE in a right triangle. The diagram shows a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E. They've given me that sin D is 0.7, and one of the sides, which is EF, is 7 units long. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what sine means in a right triangle. Sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, and the sides are DE, EF, and DF. Since it's a right triangle at E, DF must be the hypotenuse.

So, sin D = opposite side / hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle D would be EF, which is given as 7. The hypotenuse is DF. So, sin D = EF / DF = 0.7. That means 7 / DF = 0.7. I can solve for DF here.

Let me write that down:

sin D = EF / DF  
0.7 = 7 / DF  
So, DF = 7 / 0.7  
Calculating that, 7 divided by 0.7 is 10. So, DF is 10 units long.

Now, I need to find DE. Since it's a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, DF² = DE² + EF².

We know DF is 10 and EF is 7, so plugging those in:

10² = DE² + 7²  
100 = DE² + 49  
Subtracting 49 from both sides:  
DE² = 100 - 49  
DE² = 51  
Taking the square root of both sides:  
DE = sqrt(51)

Wait, sqrt(51) is approximately 7.141, but since the problem doesn't specify rounding, I should leave it as sqrt(51). Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Identified angle D, opposite side EF = 7, hypotenuse DF.
2. Used sin D = 0.7 = 7 / DF, solved DF = 10.
3. Applied Pythagorean theorem: 10² = DE² + 7².
4. Calculated DE² = 100 - 49 = 51, so DE = sqrt(51).

That seems correct. Alternatively, I could have used cosine since I know angle D and the adjacent side DE. Let me try that approach to verify.

Cosine of angle D is adjacent over hypotenuse, which would be DE / DF. So, cos D = DE / DF. But I don't know cos D yet. However, since sin² D + cos² D = 1, I can find cos D.

Given sin D = 0.7, so sin² D = 0.49. Therefore, cos² D = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51. So, cos D = sqrt(0.51). But sqrt(0.51) is approximately 0.7141, but exact value is sqrt(51)/10 because sqrt(0.51) = sqrt(51/100) = sqrt(51)/10.

So, cos D = sqrt(51)/10. Then, DE = DF * cos D = 10 * (sqrt(51)/10) = sqrt(51). Yep, same result. So that confirms it.

Therefore, DE is sqrt(51). I think that's the answer.

**Final Answer**
The length of DE is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we need to find the length of DE. 

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
Given \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we have:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Solving for \(DF\):
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we apply the Pythagorean theorem to find DE:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Solving for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of DE is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise. The given complex numbers are \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \). Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves a few steps. I think it's something like translating the complex plane so that the point \( c \) becomes the origin, then performing the rotation, and then translating back. Yeah, that sounds right. So, the general formula for rotating a point \( z \) around a point \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is:

\[ w = c + e^{i\theta}(z - c) \]

Let me write that down:

\[ w = c + e^{i\theta}(z - c) \]

Where \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) in this case. So, I need to compute \( e^{i\pi/4} \), subtract \( c \) from \( z \), multiply by \( e^{i\pi/4} \), and then add \( c \) back.

Alright, let's compute each part step by step.

First, let me write down \( z \) and \( c \):

\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)

\( c = 2 - 3i \)

So, \( z - c \) would be:

\( (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3) ]i \)

Simplify that:

The real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

The imaginary part: \( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) + 3 = -3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3 = -3\sqrt{2} \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)

Hmm, that simplifies nicely. So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \). Maybe that will help later.

Next, I need to compute \( e^{i\pi/4} \). I remember that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \). So, for \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):

\( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

\( \sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Therefore, \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

So, now I need to multiply \( e^{i\pi/4} \) by \( z - c \). Let's write that out:

\( e^{i\pi/4}(z - c) = \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \times (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \)

Let me compute this multiplication. Let's denote \( a = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( b = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), so the expression becomes:

\( (a + ib)(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \)

Multiplying this out:

First, multiply \( a \) with each term:

\( a \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

\( a \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = \frac{-3 \times 2}{2}i = -3i \)

Then, multiply \( ib \) with each term:

\( ib \times \sqrt{2} = i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

\( ib \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = i \times (-3 \times 2 / 2) i = i \times (-3i) = -3i^2 \)

But \( i^2 = -1 \), so \( -3i^2 = 3 \)

Now, adding all these together:

1 (from first term) + (-3i) + i (from third term) + 3 (from fourth term)

Combine like terms:

Real parts: 1 + 3 = 4

Imaginary parts: (-3i + i) = (-2i)

So, the result is \( 4 - 2i \)

Wait, let me double-check that multiplication because I might have messed up somewhere.

Wait, let's do it again step by step:

\( (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \)

Multiply each term:

First term: \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second term: \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = \frac{-3 \times 2}{2}i = -3i \)

Third term: \( i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Fourth term: \( i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = i \times (-3 \times 2 / 2) i = i \times (-3i) = -3i^2 = 3 \) because \( i^2 = -1 \)

So, adding all four terms:

1 (real) + (-3i) + i + 3 (real)

So, real parts: 1 + 3 = 4

Imaginary parts: (-3i + i) = (-2i)

So, yes, the result is \( 4 - 2i \). Okay, that seems correct.

So, \( e^{i\pi/4}(z - c) = 4 - 2i \)

Now, the next step is to add \( c \) back to this result to get \( w \).

So, \( w = c + (4 - 2i) \)

Given that \( c = 2 - 3i \), let's compute:

\( w = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = (2 + 4) + (-3i - 2i) = 6 - 5i \)

Wait, that seems straightforward. So, \( w = 6 - 5i \). Hmm, is that correct?

Let me verify each step again to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, \( z - c \):

\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)

\( c = 2 - 3i \)

Subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):

Real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

Imaginary part: \( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3) = -3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3 = -3\sqrt{2} \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). That's correct.

Then, \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Correct.

Multiplying \( e^{i\pi/4} \) by \( z - c \):

\( (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})(\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \)

Let me compute this multiplication again:

First, multiply \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Then, \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = \frac{-3 \times 2}{2}i = -3i \)

Next, \( i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Lastly, \( i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}i) = i \times (-3 \times 2 / 2) i = i \times (-3i) = -3i^2 = 3 \)

Adding all together: 1 - 3i + i + 3 = (1 + 3) + (-3i + i) = 4 - 2i. Correct.

Then, adding \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \). That seems correct.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the formula correct? I remember that when rotating around a point, you translate, rotate, then translate back. So, yes, \( w = c + e^{i\theta}(z - c) \). So, that formula is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is:

\( w = (z - c) \times e^{i\theta} + c \). Which is the same as above.

So, seems like the steps are correct.

But just to be thorough, let me represent \( z \) and \( c \) as vectors and see if the rotation makes sense.

First, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \). So, in coordinates, that's \( (2 + \sqrt{2}, -3 - 3\sqrt{2}) \).

\( c = 2 - 3i \), so coordinates \( (2, -3) \).

So, the vector from \( c \) to \( z \) is \( (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2, -3 - 3\sqrt{2} - (-3)) = (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \). So, that's the vector \( z - c \), which is \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \), as we had before.

Now, rotating this vector by \( \pi/4 \). The rotation matrix for \( \pi/4 \) is:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \]

Which for \( \theta = \pi/4 \) is:

\[ \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \]

So, applying this to the vector \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \):

First component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + (-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Compute:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3 \times \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

Second component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Compute:

\( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{-3 \times 2}{2} = 1 - 3 = -2 \)

So, the rotated vector is \( (4, -2) \). Then, adding back the center \( c = (2, -3) \):

\( (4 + 2, -2 + (-3)) = (6, -5) \). So, in complex form, that's \( 6 - 5i \). So, same result as before.

Therefore, \( w = 6 - 5i \). So, that seems correct.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the multiplication another way, perhaps using complex numbers directly.

We had \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Let me write this as \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \). Then, multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

So, \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

First, multiply \( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Then, \( \sqrt{2} \times i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \times \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Then, \( -3i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Wait, no, actually, let me do it properly:

Wait, actually, it's \( (1 - 3i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \) multiplied by \( \sqrt{2} \).

Wait, no, actually, the expression is \( \sqrt{2}(1 - 3i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \","[3, '3']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
"To simplify the square root of 242, I start by factoring 242 into its prime components. I recognize that 242 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 242 by 2 gives me 121. Next, I factor 121, which is a perfect square since 11 multiplied by 11 equals 121. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is 2 multiplied by 11 squared.

Using the property of square roots that allows me to separate the square root of a product into the product of the square roots, I can rewrite the square root of 242 as the square root of 2 times the square root of 11 squared.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), I will use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\).

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\).

I need to find the value of \(k\) that makes the exponent of \(x\) equal to zero, which will give the constant term. The exponent of \(x\) in each term is \(3(5 - k) - 2k\). Setting this equal to zero:

\(15 - 3k - 2k = 0\)

Solving for \(k\):

\(15 - 5k = 0\)

\(5k = 15\)

\(k = 3\)

Now, I will calculate the term when \(k = 3\):

Calculating each part:

\(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)

Set the exponent equal to zero to find \( k \):

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center to coincide with its original position, I start by understanding the concept of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has five sides of equal length and five equal angles, which means it has rotational symmetry.

The total angle around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since there are five sides, the angle between each adjacent vertex from the center is 360 divided by 5, which equals 72 degrees. This means that rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will align each vertex with the position of the next one.

To find the minimum rotation needed for the pentagon to coincide with its original position, I consider the smallest angle that results in this alignment. Since each rotation of 72 degrees brings the pentagon back to a position where it looks identical to its original state, the minimum number of degrees required is 72 degrees.
</think>

To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center until it coincides with its original position, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand Rotational Symmetry:**
   - A regular pentagon has **5 sides** of equal length and **5 equal angles**.
   - It exhibits **rotational symmetry**, meaning it can be rotated around its center and still look the same.

2. **Calculate the Angle of Rotation:**
   - The total angle around the center of the pentagon is **360 degrees**.
   - Since there are **5 sides**, the angle between each adjacent vertex from the center is:
     \[
     \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
     \]

"First, I need to identify the given points of the parallelogram: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y), with the condition that x > 7.

In a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel, which means the midpoints of the diagonals are the same. I'll use this property to find the missing point.

Let's label the points as A(5, 3), B(6, 8), C(7, 4), and D(x, y). The diagonals are AC and BD.

The midpoint of diagonal AC can be calculated as:
Midpoint of AC = ((5 + 7)/2, (3 + 4)/2) = (6, 3.5)

Since the midpoints of both diagonals must be equal, the midpoint of diagonal BD should also be (6, 3.5).

Now, let's find the midpoint of BD:
Midpoint of BD = ((6 + x)/2, (8 + y)/2) = (6, 3.5)

Setting the coordinates equal:
(6 + x)/2 = 6 and (8 + y)/2 = 3.5

Solving for x:
6 + x = 12
x = 6

Solving for y:
8 + y = 7
y = -1

However, this result gives x = 6, which does not satisfy the condition x > 7. This suggests that the initial labeling of the points might be incorrect.

Let's try a different labeling where the points are A(5, 3), B(6, 8), C(x, y), and D(7, 4). Now, the diagonals are AC and BD.

Calculating the midpoint of BD:
Midpoint of BD = ((6 + 7)/2, (8 + 4)/2) = (6.5, 6)

Since the midpoints must be equal, the midpoint of AC should also be (6.5, 6).

Now, let's find the midpoint of AC:
Midpoint of AC = ((5 + x)/2, (3 + y)/2) = (6.5, 6)

Setting the coordinates equal:
(5 + x)/2 = 6.5 and (3 + y)/2 = 6

Solving for x:
5 + x = 13
x = 8

Solving for y:
3 + y = 12
y = 9

This time, x = 8, which satisfies the condition x > 7. Therefore, the missing point is (8, 9), and the sum of x and y is 17.

To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with given vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) where \(x > 7\), we can use the properties of a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the midpoints of the diagonals are the same.

Let's denote the vertices as follows:
- \(A(5, 3)\)
- \(B(6, 8)\)
- \(C(7, 4)\)
- \(D(x, y)\)

The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) should be equal to the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

**Step 1: Calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\).**

\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, 3.5 \right)
\]

**Step 2: Set the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) equal to the midpoint of \(AC\).**

\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, 3.5 \right)
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \(x\) and \(y\).**

\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 6 + x = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 6
\]
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = 3.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 8 + y = 7 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -1
\]

However, this result gives \(x = 6\), which does not satisfy the condition \(x > 7\). This suggests that the initial labeling of the points might be incorrect. Let's try a different labeling where the points are \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(x, y)\), and \(D(7, 4)\).

**Step 4: Recalculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).**

\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6 + 7}{2}, \frac{8 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6.5, 6 \right)
\]

**Step 5: Set the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) equal to the midpoint of \(BD\).**

\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5 + x}{2}, \frac{3 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6.5, 6 \right)
\]

**Step 6: Solve for \(x\) and \(y\).**

\[
\frac{5 + x}{2} = 6.5 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 5 + x = 13 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 8
\]
\[
\frac{3 + y}{2} = 6 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 3 + y = 12 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 9
\]

Now, \(x = 8\) satisfies the condition \(x > 7\). Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\).

"To find the value of \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), I start by using the relationship between sine and cosine.

I know that \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\). Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), I can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}

This simplifies to:

\[

\[
5x^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2

"Okay, so I have this function here: f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). The problem is asking about the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote, and then to find the sum of a, b, and c where a and b are the vertical asymptotes and c is the horizontal asymptote. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is a quadratic: x² - 5x - 14. Let me try to factor that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, factors of -14 could be 2 and -7 because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. So, yes, that works. Therefore, the denominator factors as (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator is zero when x = -2 or x = 7. 

Now, I should check if the numerator is zero at these points. The numerator is 2x, so when x = -2, the numerator is 2*(-2) = -4, which isn't zero. When x = 7, the numerator is 2*7 = 14, which is also not zero. So, both x = -2 and x = 7 are vertical asymptotes. Therefore, a = -2 and b = 7.

Next, I need to find the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 (since it's 2x) and the degree of the denominator is 2 (since it's x²). 

When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree is higher, there's no horizontal asymptote (but maybe an oblique one). In this case, since 1 < 2, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.

Now, I need to find a + b + c. That would be (-2) + 7 + 0. Let me compute that: (-2) + 7 is 5, and 5 + 0 is 5. So, the sum is 5.

Wait, let me double-check my factoring of the denominator. x² - 5x -14. If I expand (x + 2)(x - 7), I get x² -7x + 2x -14, which simplifies to x² -5x -14. Yep, that's correct. So, the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x = -2 and x = 7.

And for the horizontal asymptote, since the denominator's degree is higher, it's y = 0. So, c is definitely 0. Therefore, adding them up: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. That seems right.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. The steps are straightforward: factor the denominator, find where it's zero, check the numerator, determine the horizontal asymptote based on degrees, and then add them up. So, I feel confident that the answer is 5.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{5}\).
</think>

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to factor the denominator. The denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) factors as \( (x + 2)(x - 7) \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). 

Next, we determine the horizontal asymptote. Since the degree of the numerator (1) is less than the degree of the denominator (2), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \), and the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Adding these values together, we get \( -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \).

The value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To compute 99 squared, I can use the formula for the square of a number close to 100. Since 99 is 1 less than 100, I can express 99 squared as (100 - 1) squared.

Expanding this, I get 100 squared minus 2 times 100 times 1 plus 1 squared, which simplifies to 10,000 minus 200 plus 1, resulting in 9,801.

Next, I add 99 to 9,801, which gives me 9,900.

Finally, adding 1 to 9,900 results in 9,901.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for any two-dimensional vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, or the induced norm, is the smallest such \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). So, essentially, I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.

Let me recall how to compute the operator norm. For a matrix \( A \), the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm is equal to the largest singular value of \( A \). Alternatively, it can be found by computing the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). That sounds a bit complicated, but maybe I can work through it step by step.

First, let me write down the matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, \( A \) is a 2x2 matrix. To find the operator norm, I need to compute \( A^T A \). Let me compute the transpose of \( A \) first.

The transpose of \( A \), denoted \( A^T \), is:

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, multiplying \( A^T \) by \( A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me compute each element of the resulting matrix:

- The element at (1,1) is \( 2*2 + 0*0 = 4 + 0 = 4 \).
- The element at (1,2) is \( 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \).
- The element at (2,1) is \( 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6 + 0 = 6 \).
- The element at (2,2) is \( 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \).

So, putting it all together:

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix because the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

Where \( I \) is the identity matrix. Let's write that out:

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = 0
\]

The determinant of a 2x2 matrix \( \begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} \) is \( ad - bc \). So, applying that here:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - (6)(6) = 0
\]

Let me compute this:

First, expand \( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) \):

\[
4*13 - 4\lambda - 13\lambda + \lambda^2 = 52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2
\]

Then subtract \( 6*6 = 36 \):

\[
52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2 - 36 = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

So, the characteristic equation is:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Now, let's solve for \( \lambda \). Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{(-17)^2 - 4*1*16}}{2*1} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2}
\]

Since \( \sqrt{225} = 15 \), this simplifies to:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, the two eigenvalues are:

1. \( \lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. The largest eigenvalue is 16. Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of 16, which is 4.

Wait, hold on. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake here. So, the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). Since the largest eigenvalue is 16, then the operator norm is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). So, \( C = 4 \).

But just to double-check, maybe I can think of another way. Alternatively, the operator norm can be found by maximizing \( \|A \mathbf{v}\| \) subject to \( \|\mathbf{v}\| = 1 \). So, maybe I can parametrize \( \mathbf{v} \) as \( \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \) with \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), and then compute \( \|A \mathbf{v}\|^2 \) and find its maximum.

Let me try that approach as a verification.

So, \( A \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ 0x - 2y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \).

Then, the squared norm is:

\[
(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2 = (4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2) + 4y^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

This is a constrained optimization problem. I can use Lagrange multipliers for this.

Let me set up the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 - \lambda(x^2 + y^2 - 1)
\]

Taking partial derivatives:

1. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial x} = 8x + 12y - 2\lambda x = 0 \)
2. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial y} = 12x + 26y - 2\lambda y = 0 \)
3. \( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \lambda} = -(x^2 + y^2 - 1) = 0 \)

So, from the first equation:

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies (8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0 \quad (1)
\]

From the second equation:

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0 \quad (2)
\]

So, we have a system of two equations:

1. \( (8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0 \)
2. \( 12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0 \)

This can be written in matrix form as:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\ 12 & 26 - 2\lambda \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\ 12 & 26 - 2\lambda \end{pmatrix} = 0
\]

Compute the determinant:

\[
(8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - (12)(12) = 0
\]

Let me compute this:

First, expand \( (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) \):

\[
8*26 - 8*2\lambda - 2\lambda*26 + (2\lambda)^2 = 208 - 16\lambda - 52\lambda + 4\lambda^2 = 208 - 68\lambda + 4\lambda^2
\]

Subtract \( 12*12 = 144 \):

\[
208 - 68\lambda + 4\lambda^2 - 144 = 0
\]

Simplify:

\[
4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 64 = 0
\]

Divide the entire equation by 4 to simplify:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Wait, that's the same quadratic equation as before! So, solving this:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

Which gives \( \lambda = 16 \) and \( \lambda = 1 \). So, the maximum value of \( \|A \mathbf{v}\|^2 \) is 16, hence the maximum \( \|A \mathbf{v}\| \) is 4, which occurs when \( \lambda = 16 \). Therefore, the operator norm is indeed 4.

Just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to see this. Maybe by looking at the matrix and its action on vectors. The matrix is upper triangular, so its eigenvalues are 2 and -2. But operator norm isn't just the maximum of the absolute values of eigenvalues, right? Because the matrix isn't symmetric, so the operator norm isn't just the spectral radius.

Wait, actually, for non-symmetric matrices, the operator norm can be larger than the spectral radius. So, in this case, the eigenvalues are 2 and -2, but the operator norm is 4, which is larger. So, that makes sense.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the norm by considering specific vectors. For example, take a vector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \). Then, \( A \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \). The norm squared is \( (2x + 3y)^2 + ( -2y)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \). So, as before.

To find the maximum of this quadratic form subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), which is exactly what I did earlier, leading to the maximum value of 16, so the norm is 4.

Alternatively, maybe I can parametrize \( x \) and \( y \) in terms of an angle \( \theta \), since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Let me set \( x = \cos\theta \) and \( y = \sin\theta \). Then, the expression becomes:

\[
4\cos^2\theta + 12\cos\theta \sin\theta + 13\sin^2\theta
\]

Simplify this:

First, note that \( 4\cos^2\theta + 13\sin^2\theta = 4(\cos^2\theta + \sin^2\theta) + 9\sin^2\theta = 4 + 9\sin^2\theta \).

So, the expression becomes:

\[
4 + 9\sin^2\theta + 12\cos\theta \sin\theta
\]

Hmm, maybe I can write this as:

\[
4 + 9\sin^2\theta + 6\sin(2\theta)
\]

Wait, because \( 12\cos\theta \sin\theta = 6\sin(2\theta) \). So, the expression is:

\[
4 + 9\sin^2\theta + 6\sin(2\theta)
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can write \( \sin^2\theta \) in terms of \( \cos(2\theta) \):

\[
\sin^2\theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}
\]

So, substituting:

\[
4 + 9\left( \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2} \right) + 6\sin(2\theta) = 4 + \frac{9}{2} - \frac{9}{2}\cos(2\theta) + 6\sin(2\theta)
\]

Simplify:

First, I remember that the equation \( z^5 = 1 \) means that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). These roots can be expressed in the form \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we're looking at the primitive 5th roots of unity, which correspond to \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \).

\[
S = z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}
\]

I notice that \( \frac{1}{z} \) is the same as \( z^4 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \) implies \( z^{-1} = z^{4} \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^{3} \). So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

S = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3

So, \( S = z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \). Hmm, that's interesting. I remember that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. That is,

\[
1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0
\]

So, if I subtract 1 from both sides, I get:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1
\]

Wait, that's exactly the expression for \( S \)! So, does that mean \( S = -1 \)?

But let me double-check that. If \( 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0 \), then indeed \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \). So, substituting back, \( S = -1 \).

But just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me think about another approach. Maybe using Euler's formula or something related to trigonometric identities.

Since \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, it can be written as \( z = e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Let's take \( k = 1 \) for simplicity, so \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \). Then,

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{2\pi i /5} + e^{-2\pi i /5} = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)
\]
\[
z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = e^{4\pi i /5} + e^{-4\pi i /5} = 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right)
\]

So, \( S = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) + 2\cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right) \). Let me compute this.

I know that \( \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right) = \cos\left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{5}\right) = -\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) \). Similarly, \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \) is just \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \).

So, substituting back,

\[
S = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) + 2\left(-\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)\right) = 2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) - 2\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right)
\]

Hmm, I need to compute this value. I remember that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) \) and \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) \) have specific exact values.

Let me recall that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, actually, let me compute it properly.

I know that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, let me think again.

Actually, \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps I should recall the exact value.

Yes, \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me look it up in my mind.

Wait, I think \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Hmm, no, perhaps it's better to recall that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, maybe I should use exact expressions.

Alternatively, I can use the identity that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, that's not right.

Wait, actually, I think \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, perhaps I should compute it numerically to check.

Wait, \( \pi \) is approximately 3.1416, so \( \pi/5 \) is about 0.6283 radians. The cosine of that is approximately 0.8090.

Similarly, \( 2\pi/5 \) is about 1.2566 radians, and cosine of that is approximately 0.3090.

So, \( 2\cos(2\pi/5) \) is about 0.6180, and \( 2\cos(\pi/5) \) is about 1.6180. So, \( 0.6180 - 1.6180 = -1 \). So, that gives \( S = -1 \). So, that matches the earlier result.

Therefore, both methods give me \( S = -1 \). So, that seems consistent.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that \( z \) satisfies \( z^5 = 1 \), so \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \). We can factor this as \( (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1 \), which is exactly the expression for \( S \). So, that's another way to see it.

Therefore, regardless of the method, the value of \( S \) is \( -1 \).

Wait, just to make sure, let me try plugging in a specific value for \( z \). Let's take \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \). Then, compute \( z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 \).

Compute \( z = e^{2\pi i /5} \), so \( 1/z = e^{-2\pi i /5} \), \( z^2 = e^{4\pi i /5} \), and \( 1/z^2 = e^{-4\pi i /5} \).

So, \( z + 1/z = e^{2\pi i /5} + e^{-2\pi i /5} = 2\cos(2\pi/5) \approx 2 * 0.3090 = 0.6180 \).

Similarly, \( z^2 + 1/z^2 = e^{4\pi i /5} + e^{-4\pi i /5} = 2\cos(4\pi/5) \approx 2 * (-0.8090) = -1.6180 \).

Adding these together: 0.6180 + (-1.6180) = -1. So, that's consistent.

Alternatively, if I take \( z = e^{4\pi i /5} \), then \( 1/z = e^{-4\pi i /5} = e^{6\pi i /5} \), and \( z^2 = e^{8\pi i /5} = e^{-2\pi i /5} \), \( 1/z^2 = e^{-8\pi i /5} = e^{2\pi i /5} \).

So, \( z + 1/z = e^{4\pi i /5} + e^{-4\pi i /5} = 2\cos(4\pi/5) \approx -1.6180 \).

\( z^2 + 1/z^2 = e^{-2\pi i /5} + e^{2\pi i /5} = 2\cos(2\pi/5) \approx 0.6180 \).

Adding them together: -1.6180 + 0.6180 = -1. So, same result.

Therefore, regardless of which primitive 5th root of unity I choose, the expression \( S \) evaluates to -1.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is -1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-1}

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to compute the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, which means \( z \) can be written as \( e^{2\pi i k/5} \) for \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). The expression we need to compute is:

\[
S = z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}
\]

We know that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
S = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3
\]

The sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero:

\[
1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0
\]

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we find:

\[
z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), I start by recalling that \(\sec x\) is the reciprocal of \(\cos x\). This allows me to rewrite the first term as \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Next, I observe that the second term, \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), can be expressed as \(\tan x\). However, to combine the two terms effectively, I'll keep them in their current form.

Now, I have the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). To combine these fractions, I need a common denominator, which is \(\cos x \sin x\). I rewrite the second term with this denominator by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(\sin x\), resulting in \(\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Subtracting the two fractions gives me \(\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). I recognize that \(1 - \sin^2 x\) is equal to \(\cos^2 x\) based on the Pythagorean identity.

Substituting this back into the expression, I have \(\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). Simplifying the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator leaves me with \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\).

"First, I'll define variables for the weights of each creature: let \( T \) represent the weight of a treek, \( S \) the weight of a squig, and \( G \) the weight of a goolee.

From the first statement, ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This gives the equation:

"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, that means for every y-value, there should be some x such that f(x) = y. So, the function should be surjective, right? It should cover all possible y-values.

Let me think about what this function looks like. For x >= a, it's a quadratic function, ax². Since a is a coefficient, if a is positive, it's a parabola opening upwards, and if a is negative, it opens downwards. For x < a, it's a linear function, ax + 2a. So, it's a straight line with slope a and y-intercept 2a.

I need to ensure that for every horizontal line y = k, there's at least one x such that f(x) = k. So, the function must be continuous or at least cover all y-values without any gaps. But wait, the function is piecewise, so maybe it's not necessarily continuous, but it needs to cover all y-values.

Wait, actually, if the function isn't continuous, there might be a jump, which could create a gap in the y-values. So, maybe the function needs to be continuous? Or maybe not necessarily, but the ranges of both pieces should cover all y-values without leaving any gaps.

Let me analyze both pieces.

First, for x >= a, f(x) = ax². The range of this part depends on the value of a. If a > 0, then ax² is a parabola opening upwards, so its minimum value is at x = a, which is f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. As x increases, f(x) goes to infinity. So, the range for x >= a is [a³, ∞) if a > 0.

If a < 0, then ax² is a parabola opening downwards, so as x increases, f(x) decreases. The maximum value is at x = a, which is a³. As x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. So, the range for x >= a is (-∞, a³] if a < 0.

Now, for x < a, f(x) = ax + 2a. This is a linear function. Let's see its behavior.

If a > 0, then as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. So, the range for x < a is (-∞, a² + 2a) if a > 0.

If a < 0, then as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity (since a is negative, ax becomes more positive as x becomes more negative), and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. So, the range for x < a is (a² + 2a, ∞) if a < 0.

So, putting it all together:

Case 1: a > 0

- For x >= a: [a³, ∞)
- For x < a: (-∞, a² + 2a)

So, the total range is (-∞, a² + 2a) union [a³, ∞). For the function to cover all real numbers, the upper bound of the linear part must be greater than or equal to the lower bound of the quadratic part. That is, a² + 2a >= a³.

So, we need a² + 2a >= a³.

Let me write that inequality:

a² + 2a >= a³

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - a² - 2a <= 0

Factor:

a(a² - a - 2) <= 0

Factor the quadratic:

a(a - 2)(a + 1) <= 0

So, the critical points are a = -1, 0, 2.

We can make a sign chart:

- For a < -1: Let's pick a = -2: (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = (-2)(4) = -8 <= 0. So, satisfies.

- For -1 < a < 0: Let's pick a = -0.5: (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = (-0.5)(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

- For 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1: (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 <= 0. Satisfies.

- For a > 2: Let's pick a = 3: (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

So, the inequality a(a - 2)(a + 1) <= 0 holds when a <= -1 or 0 <= a <= 2.

But in this case, we're considering a > 0, so the relevant interval is 0 < a <= 2.

So, for a > 0, the function's range is (-∞, a² + 2a) union [a³, ∞). To cover all real numbers, we need a² + 2a >= a³, which is satisfied when 0 < a <= 2.

But wait, when a = 2, let's check:

a² + 2a = 4 + 4 = 8

a³ = 8

So, the ranges are (-∞, 8) and [8, ∞). So, together, they cover all real numbers. So, at a = 2, the function is continuous at x = a, because f(a) from the left is a² + 2a = 8, and from the right is a³ = 8. So, it's continuous at x = a.

If a > 2, say a = 3, then a² + 2a = 9 + 6 = 15, and a³ = 27. So, the ranges are (-∞, 15) and [27, ∞). There's a gap between 15 and 27, so the function doesn't cover those y-values. So, a cannot be greater than 2.

Similarly, for a < 2, say a = 1, a² + 2a = 1 + 2 = 3, and a³ = 1. So, the ranges are (-∞, 3) and [1, ∞). So, together, they cover all real numbers because (-∞, 3) and [1, ∞) overlap between 1 and 3. So, no gaps.

Wait, but if a is less than 2, say a = 1, the function is continuous at x = a? Let's check:

f(a) from the left: a² + 2a = 1 + 2 = 3

f(a) from the right: a³ = 1

So, it's not continuous. There's a jump discontinuity at x = a. But the ranges still cover all real numbers because the linear part goes up to 3, and the quadratic part starts at 1, so together, they cover everything.

But wait, if a is less than 2, say a = 1, then the linear part goes up to 3, and the quadratic part starts at 1. So, the quadratic part covers [1, ∞), and the linear part covers (-∞, 3). So, together, they cover (-∞, ∞) because 3 is greater than 1, so the union is all real numbers.

But if a is greater than 2, like a = 3, the linear part goes up to 15, and the quadratic part starts at 27, so there's a gap between 15 and 27.

So, for a > 2, the function doesn't cover all y-values. So, the maximum a is 2.

But wait, let me check for a = 2. The function is continuous at x = a, because f(a) from both sides is 8. So, the function is continuous there, and the ranges are (-∞, 8) and [8, ∞), which together cover all real numbers.

If a is less than 2, the function is not continuous, but the ranges still cover all real numbers because the upper limit of the linear part is higher than the lower limit of the quadratic part.

So, the maximum a is 2.

Wait, but let me think again. If a is negative, what happens?

Case 2: a < 0

For x >= a: f(x) = ax², which is a downward opening parabola. So, the range is (-∞, a³]. Since a is negative, a³ is negative.

For x < a: f(x) = ax + 2a. Since a is negative, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a² + 2a.

So, the range for x < a is (a² + 2a, ∞). Since a is negative, a² is positive, and 2a is negative. So, a² + 2a could be positive or negative depending on the value of a.

Wait, let's compute a² + 2a for a < 0.

Let me pick a = -1: a² + 2a = 1 - 2 = -1

a = -2: a² + 2a = 4 - 4 = 0

a = -3: a² + 2a = 9 - 6 = 3

So, for a < 0, a² + 2a can be negative, zero, or positive.

So, the range for x < a is (a² + 2a, ∞). The range for x >= a is (-∞, a³].

So, to cover all real numbers, the lower bound of the linear part (a² + 2a) must be less than or equal to the upper bound of the quadratic part (a³). So, a² + 2a <= a³.

So, the inequality is a² + 2a <= a³

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - a² - 2a >= 0

Factor:

a(a² - a - 2) >= 0

Which is the same as before: a(a - 2)(a + 1) >= 0

So, critical points at a = -1, 0, 2.

Sign chart:

- For a < -1: Let's pick a = -2: (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = (-2)(4) = -8 < 0. Doesn't satisfy.

- For -1 < a < 0: Let's pick a = -0.5: (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = (-0.5)(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. Satisfies.

- For 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1: (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 < 0. Doesn't satisfy.

- For a > 2: Let's pick a = 3: (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0. Satisfies.

But in this case, we're considering a < 0, so the relevant interval is -1 < a < 0.

So, for a < 0, the inequality a² + 2a <= a³ is satisfied when -1 < a < 0.

So, for a < 0, the function's range is (-∞, a³] union (a² + 2a, ∞). To cover all real numbers, we need a² + 2a <= a³, which is satisfied when -1 < a < 0.

But wait, let's check for a = -1:

a² + 2a = 1 - 2 = -1

a³ = -1

So, the ranges are (-∞, -1] and (-1, ∞). So, together, they cover all real numbers except y = -1? Wait, no, because (-∞, -1] union (-1, ∞) is all real numbers. So, actually, it's covered.

Wait, but at a = -1, the function is continuous at x = a because f(a) from the left is a² + 2a = -1, and from the right is a³ = -1. So, it's continuous.

But for a < -1, say a = -2:

a² + 2a = 4 - 4 = 0

a³ = -8

So, the ranges are (-∞, -8] and (0, ∞). So, there's a gap between -8 and 0. So, the function doesn't cover y-values between -8 and 0. So, a cannot be less than or equal to -1.

So, for a < 0, the function covers all real numbers only when -1 <= a < 0.

But wait, when a = -1, the function is continuous, and the ranges are (-∞, -1] and (-1, ∞), which together cover all real numbers.

So, for a < 0, the maximum a is -1, but since we're looking for the largest value of a, which is positive, the maximum a is 2.

Wait, but hold on. The question is asking for the largest value of a such that the graph intersects every horizontal line at least once. So, the function must be surjective.

From the above analysis, for a > 0, the maximum a is 2, and for a < 0, the maximum a is -1. But since we're looking for the largest a, which is 2.

But let me double-check for a = 2.

At a = 2, the function is continuous at x = 2, because f(2) from the left is 2² + 2*2 = 4 + 4 = 8, and from the right","[8, '8']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To find the value of \( c \) that makes the radius of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) equal to 1, I'll start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a circle.

First, I'll complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

For the \( x \)-terms:
\( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).

For the \( y \)-terms:
\( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

Substituting these back into the original equation:
\( (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \).

Combining the constants:
\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \).

Rearranging gives the standard form:
\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \).

The radius of the circle is the square root of the right side, so:
\( \sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \).

Squaring both sides:
\( 34 - c = 1 \).

Solving for \( c \):
\( c = 34 - 1 = 33 \).

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is 33.
</think>

To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle defined by the equation
\[
x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
\]
has a radius of length 1, follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite the Equation in Standard Form:**

   The standard form of a circle's equation is:
   \[
   (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
   \]
   where \((h, k)\) is the center and \( r \) is the radius.

   To convert the given equation into this form, complete the square for both \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

2. **Complete the Square for \( x \)-Terms:**
   \[
   x^2 - 10x = (x^2 - 10x + 25) - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25
   \]

3. **Complete the Square for \( y \)-Terms:**
   \[
   y^2 + 6y = (y^2 + 6y + 9) - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9
   \]

4. **Substitute Back into the Original Equation:**
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
   \]
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]

5. **Determine the Radius:**

   The radius \( r \) is given by:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{34 - c}
   \]
   We are told that the radius is 1, so:
   \[
   \sqrt{34 - c} = 1
   \]
   Square both sides:
   \[
   34 - c = 1
   \]
   Solve for \( c \):
   \[
   c = 34 - 1 = 33

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 for which there exists an x in [0,1] such that f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The parameter λ controls the shape of the parabola. When λ is 0, the function is just zero everywhere, and as λ increases, the parabola becomes wider until λ=4, where it's the widest possible within the interval [0,1].

The problem is asking for values of λ where there's some x that isn't a fixed point (so f(x) ≠ x), but when you apply f twice, you get back to x. In other words, x is a periodic point of period 2. So, I need to find λ such that f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x.

Let me write down the equations. First, f(x) = λx(1 - x). Then, f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let me compute that:

f(f(x)) = λ*(λx(1 - x))*(1 - λx(1 - x)).

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

We need f(f(x)) = x, so:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me rearrange this equation:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, either x = 0 or the term in the brackets is zero.

But x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is also a fixed point because f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1) = 0, which is different from 1 unless λ is 0, but λ is between 0 and 4. So, x=1 is not a fixed point unless λ=0, which is a trivial case.

But the problem is asking for x where f(x) ≠ x, so x=0 and x=1 are fixed points, so we need to exclude them. Therefore, we need to solve the equation inside the brackets:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me denote y = x(1 - x). Then, the equation becomes:

λ^2 (1 - y)(1 - λ y) - 1 = 0.

But maybe that substitution complicates things. Alternatively, let's expand the expression step by step.

First, expand (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)):

(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) = (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2).

Let me multiply this out:

First, multiply 1 by each term: 1*(1) = 1, 1*(-λx) = -λx, 1*(λx^2) = λx^2.

Then, multiply -x by each term: -x*(1) = -x, -x*(-λx) = λx^2, -x*(λx^2) = -λx^3.

So, combining all these terms:

1 - λx + λx^2 - x + λx^2 - λx^3.

Now, combine like terms:

Constant term: 1.

Linear terms: -λx - x = -(λ + 1)x.

Quadratic terms: λx^2 + λx^2 = 2λx^2.

Cubic term: -λx^3.

So, altogether:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3.

Therefore, the equation becomes:

λ^2 [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3] - 1 = 0.

Let me distribute λ^2:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3 x^2 - λ^3 x^3 - 1 = 0.

So, rearranged:

-λ^3 x^3 + 2λ^3 x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

So, the equation is:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in x. Let me write it as:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^3 x + λ^2 x - λ^2 + 1 = 0.

Wait, maybe I can factor this equation. Let me see.

Looking at the equation:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^3 x + λ^2 x - λ^2 + 1 = 0.

Let me group terms:

(λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^3 x) + (λ^2 x - λ^2 + 1) = 0.

Factor out λ^3 x from the first group:

λ^3 x(x^2 - 2x + 1) + (λ^2 x - λ^2 + 1) = 0.

Notice that x^2 - 2x + 1 is (x - 1)^2, so:

λ^3 x(x - 1)^2 + (λ^2 x - λ^2 + 1) = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, since we know that f(f(x)) = x, and f(x) ≠ x, perhaps we can consider that x is a periodic point of period 2, so f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x. So, the solutions to f(f(x)) = x include all fixed points (where f(x) = x) and the period-2 points.

Therefore, to find x such that f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x, we can subtract the fixed points from the solutions of f(f(x)) = x.

So, first, let's find the fixed points by solving f(x) = x.

f(x) = λx(1 - x) = x.

So, λx(1 - x) = x.

Bring all terms to one side:

λx(1 - x) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x(λ(1 - x) - 1) = 0.

So, x = 0 or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0.

Solving λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0:

λ(1 - x) = 1.

1 - x = 1/λ.

x = 1 - 1/λ.

But x must be in [0,1], so 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1].

So, 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 ⇒ 1/λ ≤ 1 ⇒ λ ≥ 1.

And 1 - 1/λ ≤ 1 ⇒ -1/λ ≤ 0, which is always true since λ > 0.

So, fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ, provided that λ ≥ 1.

If λ < 1, then the only fixed point is x=0.

So, for λ ≥ 1, fixed points are x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ.

For λ < 1, only x=0 is a fixed point.

Now, going back to f(f(x)) = x. The solutions to this equation include the fixed points and the period-2 points.

Therefore, to find x such that f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x, we can subtract the fixed points from the solutions.

So, let's consider the equation f(f(x)) = x, which is a cubic equation as we derived earlier:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^3 x + λ^2 x - λ^2 + 1 = 0.

But perhaps instead of dealing with the cubic, we can factor out the fixed points.

Since x=0 is a fixed point, let's factor x out of the equation f(f(x)) - x = 0.

Wait, earlier we had:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, the solutions are x=0 and the solutions to λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

But x=0 is a fixed point, so the other solutions come from the equation:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me denote z = x(1 - x). Then, 1 - z = 1 - x(1 - x) = 1 - x + x^2.

Wait, maybe that substitution isn't helpful. Alternatively, let's try to express the equation in terms of z.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me set y = f(x). Then, f(f(x)) = f(y) = λ y (1 - y).

So, f(f(x)) = λ y (1 - y) = λ [λ x (1 - x)] [1 - λ x (1 - x)].

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λ x(1 - x)).

Set this equal to x:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λ x(1 - x)) = x.

As before, subtract x:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λ x(1 - x)) - x = 0.

Factor x:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λ x(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, x=0 is a solution, which is a fixed point. The other solutions come from:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λ x(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me denote u = x(1 - x). Then, 1 - u = 1 - x + x^2.

Wait, but 1 - λ x(1 - x) = 1 - λ u.

So, the equation becomes:

λ^2 (1 - u)(1 - λ u) - 1 = 0.

So, let's write that:

λ^2 (1 - u - λ u + λ u^2) - 1 = 0.

Expanding:

λ^2 - λ^2 u - λ^3 u + λ^3 u^2 - 1 = 0.

Rearranged:

λ^3 u^2 - (λ^2 + λ^3) u + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

So, this is a quadratic equation in u:

λ^3 u^2 - λ^2(1 + λ) u + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Let me write it as:

λ^3 u^2 - λ^2(1 + λ) u + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Let me try to factor this quadratic. Let me see if it factors nicely.

Looking for factors of the form (a u + b)(c u + d) = 0.

But maybe it's easier to use the quadratic formula.

The quadratic equation is:

A u^2 + B u + C = 0,

where A = λ^3,

B = -λ^2(1 + λ),

C = λ^2 - 1.

So, discriminant D = B^2 - 4AC.

Compute D:

D = [ -λ^2(1 + λ) ]^2 - 4 * λ^3 * (λ^2 - 1).

Simplify:

D = λ^4 (1 + λ)^2 - 4 λ^3 (λ^2 - 1).

Factor out λ^3:

D = λ^3 [ λ(1 + λ)^2 - 4(λ^2 - 1) ].

Compute the expression inside the brackets:

λ(1 + 2λ + λ^2) - 4λ^2 + 4.

Expand:

λ + 2λ^2 + λ^3 - 4λ^2 + 4.

Combine like terms:

λ^3 + (2λ^2 - 4λ^2) + λ + 4.

Which is:

λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4.

So, D = λ^3 (λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4).

Wait, no, wait. Wait, the expression inside the brackets was λ(1 + λ)^2 - 4(λ^2 - 1), which we expanded to λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4.

So, D = λ^3 (λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4).

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the expression inside the brackets is λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4, so D = λ^3 times that.

Wait, no, D = λ^3 multiplied by (λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4). Wait, no, that can't be because the expression inside the brackets was λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4, but that was after factoring out λ^3.

Wait, no, let me re-express:

Wait, D = λ^3 [ λ(1 + λ)^2 - 4(λ^2 - 1) ].

We computed that expression inside the brackets as λ^3 - 2λ^2 + λ + 4.

Wait, no, let me recompute:

Wait, λ(1 + λ)^2 = λ(1 + 2λ + λ^2) = λ + 2λ^2 + λ^3.

Then, subtract 4(λ^2 - 1) = 4λ^2 - 4.

So, total expression:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the degree measure of the least positive angle θ such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The numerator is cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°, and the denominator is sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°. Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can simplify it using some trigonometric identities.

First, let me write down the expression:

tan θ = [cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50] / [sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50]

I notice that both the numerator and the denominator have terms that look like products of sines and cosines. Maybe I can group them in a way that allows me to use the cosine addition or subtraction formulas. Remember, cos(A ± B) = cosA cosB ∓ sinA sinB, and sin(A ± B) = sinA cosB ± cosA sinB.

Looking at the numerator: cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20 is similar to cos(5 + 20) because cosA cosB - sinA sinB = cos(A + B). So, cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20 = cos(25°). Similarly, cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50 = cos(85°). So, the numerator becomes cos25° + cos85°.

Similarly, in the denominator: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 is sin(5 + 20) = sin25°, and -sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50 is -[sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50] = -sin(85°). So, the denominator becomes sin25° - sin85°.

So now, the expression simplifies to:

tan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]

Hmm, okay, so now I have tan θ = (cos25 + cos85)/(sin25 - sin85). Maybe I can use sum-to-product identities here. Let me recall that:

cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]
sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]

So, applying that to the numerator:

cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] cos[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°). Since cosine is even, cos(-30) = cos30, so this becomes 2 cos55 cos30.

Similarly, the denominator:

sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos[(25 + 85)/2] sin[(25 - 85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°). Since sine is odd, sin(-30) = -sin30, so this becomes 2 cos55 (-sin30) = -2 cos55 sin30.

So now, substituting back into tan θ:

tan θ = [2 cos55 cos30] / [-2 cos55 sin30]

I can cancel out the 2 and cos55 from numerator and denominator:

tan θ = [cos30] / [-sin30]

I know that cos30° is √3/2 and sin30° is 1/2, so substituting those in:

tan θ = (√3/2) / (-1/2) = (√3/2) * (-2/1) = -√3

So, tan θ = -√3. Now, I need to find the least positive angle θ where tan θ = -√3. The tangent function is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. Since we're looking for the least positive angle, it should be in the fourth quadrant, but angles are typically measured from 0° to 360°, so the reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the fourth quadrant, that would be 360° - 60° = 300°. But wait, is 300° the least positive angle? Or is there a smaller positive angle?

Wait, actually, in the unit circle, the tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. The principal value for arctangent is between -90° and 90°, but since we need a positive angle, we can add 180° to the negative angle. So, tan θ = -√3 implies θ = -60° + 180°k, where k is an integer. The least positive angle would be when k=1, so θ = 120°, because -60° + 180° = 120°. Wait, but 120° is in the second quadrant, and tan120° is tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3, which is correct.

But wait, 300° is also a solution because tan300° = tan(360° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So, both 120° and 300° satisfy tan θ = -√3. But the question asks for the least positive angle. So, 120° is smaller than 300°, so 120° is the least positive angle.

Wait, but hold on. Let me double-check. The tangent function has a period of 180°, so the general solution is θ = -60° + 180°k. So, for k=1, θ=120°, which is positive and less than 300°, so 120° is indeed the least positive angle.

But let me make sure I didn't make a mistake earlier. Let me recap:

Original expression: tan θ = [cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50] / [sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50]

I grouped the numerator as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos25 + cos85.

Similarly, denominator as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin25 - sin85.

Then, using sum-to-product:

Numerator: 2 cos55 cos30

Denominator: -2 cos55 sin30

So, tan θ = (2 cos55 cos30)/(-2 cos55 sin30) = -cos30/sin30 = -√3/1 = -√3.

So, tan θ = -√3, so θ is 120°, since that's the smallest positive angle where tangent is -√3.

Wait, but let me think again. If I have tan θ = -√3, the reference angle is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°. So, 120° is the smallest positive angle, yes.

But just to make sure, let me compute tan120°. tan(120°) = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3, which matches. So, θ = 120°.

Wait, but hold on, is 120° the least positive angle? Because 120° is less than 300°, so yes, it's the smallest positive angle that satisfies tan θ = -√3.

Therefore, the answer should be 120°, so θ = 120°.

But just to be thorough, let me check if I can express the numerator and denominator differently or if I made any mistake in the grouping.

Original numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50

I grouped as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos(5+20) + cos(35+50) = cos25 + cos85. That seems correct.

Denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50

I grouped as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin(5+20) - sin(35+50) = sin25 - sin85. That also seems correct.

Then, using sum-to-product:

cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos55 cos30

sin25 - sin85 = -2 cos55 sin30

So, tan θ = (2 cos55 cos30)/(-2 cos55 sin30) = -cos30/sin30 = -√3.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, θ is 120°, which is the least positive angle.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me compute the original expression numerically to see if it indeed equals tan120°, which is -√3 ≈ -1.732.

Let me compute numerator and denominator numerically.

First, compute numerator:

cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50

Compute each term:

cos5 ≈ 0.9962, cos20 ≈ 0.9397, so cos5 cos20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.9365

cos35 ≈ 0.8192, cos50 ≈ 0.6428, so cos35 cos50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.5265

sin5 ≈ 0.0872, sin20 ≈ 0.3420, so sin5 sin20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0298

sin35 ≈ 0.5736, sin50 ≈ 0.7660, so sin35 sin50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.4395

So numerator ≈ 0.9365 + 0.5265 - 0.0298 - 0.4395 ≈ (0.9365 + 0.5265) - (0.0298 + 0.4395) ≈ 1.463 - 0.4693 ≈ 0.9937

Denominator:

sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50

Compute each term:

sin5 ≈ 0.0872, cos20 ≈ 0.9397, so sin5 cos20 ≈ 0.0872 * 0.9397 ≈ 0.0819

sin35 ≈ 0.5736, cos50 ≈ 0.6428, so sin35 cos50 ≈ 0.5736 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.3695

cos5 ≈ 0.9962, sin20 ≈ 0.3420, so cos5 sin20 ≈ 0.9962 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.3405

cos35 ≈ 0.8192, sin50 ≈ 0.7660, so cos35 sin50 ≈ 0.8192 * 0.7660 ≈ 0.6284

So denominator ≈ 0.0819 - 0.3695 + 0.3405 - 0.6284 ≈ (0.0819 + 0.3405) - (0.3695 + 0.6284) ≈ 0.4224 - 0.9979 ≈ -0.5755

So tan θ ≈ 0.9937 / (-0.5755) ≈ -1.727, which is approximately -√3 ≈ -1.732. So that's very close, considering the approximations. So, yes, tan θ ≈ -√3, so θ ≈ 120°, which is correct.

Therefore, I'm confident that θ is 120°, so the least positive angle is 120 degrees.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in 42!, I need to count how many times the number 10 is a factor in the factorial. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, I'll count the number of pairs of these prime factors in the prime factorization of 42!.

First, I'll count the number of times 2 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. I'll do this by dividing 42 by 2, then by 4, 8, 16, and 32, and summing the quotients.

Next, I'll count the number of times 5 appears as a factor in the same range. I'll divide 42 by 5 and then by 25, and sum those quotients.

The number of trailing zeros will be the smaller of the two counts, as each pair of 2 and 5 contributes to a trailing zero.
</think>

To determine how many trailing zeros are in \(42!\) (42 factorial), we need to count how many times the number 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we'll count the number of pairs of 2s and 5s in the prime factorization of \(42!\).

**Step 1: Count the number of 2s in the prime factors of \(42!\)**

We divide 42 by powers of 2 and take the floor of each quotient:

\[
\begin{align*}
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{2} \right\rfloor &= 21 \\
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{4} \right\rfloor &= 10 \\
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{8} \right\rfloor &= 5 \\
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{16} \right\rfloor &= 2 \\
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{32} \right\rfloor &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Adding these up:

\[
21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39
\]

So, there are 39 factors of 2 in \(42!\).

**Step 2: Count the number of 5s in the prime factors of \(42!\)**

We divide 42 by powers of 5 and take the floor of each quotient:

\[
\begin{align*}
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor &= 8 \\
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor &= 1 \\
\end{align*}
\]

Adding these up:

\[
8 + 1 = 9
\]

So, there are 9 factors of 5 in \(42!\).

**Step 3: Determine the number of trailing zeros**

Each trailing zero is created by a pair of 2 and 5. Since there are fewer 5s than 2s, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of 5s.

\[
\text{Number of trailing zeros} = 9
\]

"Okay, so I need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, this looks like an optimization problem with two variables. I remember that to find maxima or minima of functions with multiple variables, we can use calculus, specifically finding partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I can simplify or analyze the function a bit.

First, let me note the domain: \( x \) and \( y \) are each in the interval [-1, 1]. So, both \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are real numbers because the expressions inside the square roots are non-negative. That makes sense.

Looking at the function, it's symmetric in a way. If I swap \( x \) and \( y \), the function remains the same. So, maybe the maximum occurs when \( x = y \)? That might be a good starting point. Let me test that idea.

If \( x = y \), then the function becomes:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
So, now I have a single-variable function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). I can find its maximum by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.

Let me compute the derivative \( g'(x) \). Using the product rule:
\[
g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
The derivative of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is \( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \). So,
\[
g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \left( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Combine the terms:
\[
g'(x) = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Set \( g'(x) = 0 \):
\[
\frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]
The denominator is always positive for \( |x| < 1 \), so we can ignore it for setting the numerator to zero:
\[
2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies 4x^2 = 2 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Since we're looking for a maximum, and \( x \) is in [-1, 1], let's check \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) because the function \( g(x) \) is positive there, and negative at \( x = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). So, plugging back into \( g(x) \):
\[
g\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1
\]
So, when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1. Hmm, that's a candidate for maximum. But is this the global maximum? Maybe I should check other possibilities.

Wait, perhaps the maximum occurs when \( x \) and \( y \) are not equal. Maybe I should consider the general case without assuming \( x = y \). Let's try using partial derivatives.

Compute the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), set them to zero, and solve for \( x \) and \( y \).

First, the partial derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \frac{d}{dx} \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]
The derivative of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) with respect to \( x \) is \( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \), so:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{y x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{d}{dy} \sqrt{1 - y^2}
\]
Which is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]
To find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero:
1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{y x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \)

Let me write these equations more clearly:
1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{y x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{x y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Looking at these two equations, they seem similar. Let me square both sides of each equation to eliminate the square roots.

Starting with equation 1:
\[
(1 - y^2) = \frac{y^2 x^2}{1 - x^2}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2
\]
Expand the left side:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = y^2 x^2
\]
Subtract \( y^2 x^2 \) from both sides:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]
So, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \)

Similarly, if I do the same for equation 2, I should get the same result. Let me check:

Equation 2:
\[
(1 - x^2) = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - y^2}
\]
Multiply both sides by \( 1 - y^2 \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
Which is the same as equation 1, leading to \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

So, the critical points lie on the unit circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). But since \( x \) and \( y \) are in [-1, 1], this is the boundary of the domain.

Wait, but the unit circle is the boundary of the domain. So, does that mean the maximum occurs on the boundary? Or is it possible that the maximum is inside the domain?

Wait, actually, the domain is the square [-1,1] x [-1,1], so the unit circle is entirely within this square except for the corners. So, the critical points are on the unit circle, which is inside the domain.

So, we have critical points on the unit circle where \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Let me parameterize this using trigonometric functions. Let me set \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \), where \( \theta \) is in [0, 2π). Then, substitute into the function \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}
\]
Simplify the square roots:
\[
\sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta
\]
So, substituting back:
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cdot \cos \theta + \sin \theta \cdot \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]
Wait, so on the unit circle, the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1. That's interesting. So, all points on the unit circle give \( f(x, y) = 1 \). But earlier, when I assumed \( x = y \), I found that \( f(x, x) = 1 \) at \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). So, that point is on the unit circle as well because \( (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 + (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \).

But wait, if all points on the unit circle give \( f(x, y) = 1 \), then the maximum value is 1. But is that the case? Let me test another point on the unit circle. For example, take \( x = 1 \), \( y = 0 \). Then, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} = 1 + 0 = 1 \). Similarly, \( f(0, 1) = 0 + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0} = 1 \). So, indeed, all points on the unit circle give \( f(x, y) = 1 \).

But wait, what about points inside the unit circle? For example, take \( x = 0.5 \), \( y = 0.5 \). Then, \( f(0.5, 0.5) = 0.5 \sqrt{1 - 0.25} + 0.5 \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} + 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.866 \), which is less than 1. So, the function is smaller inside the unit circle.

What about points outside the unit circle? Wait, but \( x \) and \( y \) are restricted to [-1, 1], so the maximum possible \( x^2 + y^2 \) is 2, but the unit circle is \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). So, points outside the unit circle but within the square would have \( x^2 + y^2 > 1 \). Let me test such a point. For example, \( x = 1 \), \( y = 1 \). Then, \( f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \). Hmm, that's less than 1. Another point: \( x = \sqrt{0.8} \), \( y = \sqrt{0.8} \). Then, \( x^2 + y^2 = 0.8 + 0.8 = 1.6 > 1 \). Compute \( f(x, y) \):
\[
f(\sqrt{0.8}, \sqrt{0.8}) = \sqrt{0.8} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.8} + \sqrt{0.8} \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0.8} = \sqrt{0.8} \cdot \sqrt{0.2} + \sqrt{0.8} \cdot \sqrt{0.2} = 2 \cdot \sqrt{0.16} = 2 \cdot 0.4 = 0.8
\]
Which is still less than 1. So, it seems that the maximum value is indeed 1, achieved on the unit circle.

But wait, let me check another point on the unit circle. For example, \( x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( y = \frac{1}{2} \). Then, \( x^2 + y^2 = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 \). Compute \( f(x, y) \):
\[
f\left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2}
\]
Simplify:
\[
= \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1
\]
So, again, it's 1. So, it seems consistent that on the unit circle, the function is always 1.

But wait, is 1 the maximum? Let me see if I can get a value higher than 1. Suppose I","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors from the origin. Specifically, vector OA is [1, 2, 3] and vector OB is [-3, -2, 1]. Hmm, I remember that to find the area of a triangle given by two vectors, I can use the cross product method. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, I think the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of vectors OA and OB. So, if I can find the cross product of OA and OB, then take its magnitude, and divide by two, that should give me the area. That makes sense because the cross product gives a vector perpendicular to both OA and OB, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB. So, half of that would be the area of the triangle.

Alright, so let me write down the vectors:

OA = [1, 2, 3]
OB = [-3, -2, 1]

I need to compute OA × OB. The cross product of two vectors [a1, a2, a3] and [b1, b2, b3] is given by the determinant of a matrix with the standard unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of the first vector in the second row, and the components of the second vector in the third row. So, let me set that up.

The cross product OA × OB is:

|i   j   k|
|1    2    3|
|-3 -2    1|

Calculating this determinant, I can expand along the first row. So, it's i times the determinant of the 2x2 matrix [2, 3; -2, 1] minus j times the determinant of [1, 3; -3, 1] plus k times the determinant of [1, 2; -3, -2].

Let me compute each of these 2x2 determinants step by step.

First, for the i component: determinant of [2, 3; -2, 1] is (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. So, the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component: determinant of [1, 3; -3, 1] is (1)(1) - (3)(-3) = 1 + 9 = 10. But since it's subtracted, it becomes -10j.

Then, the k component: determinant of [1, 2; -3, -2] is (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. So, the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, OA × OB = 8i - 10j + 4k. So, in vector form, that's [8, -10, 4].

Now, I need to find the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is calculated by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So, that would be sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2).

Calculating each term:

8^2 = 64
(-10)^2 = 100
4^2 = 16

Adding them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180.

So, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Hmm, sqrt(180) can be simplified. Let me see, 180 is 36 times 5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). So, the magnitude of OA × OB is 6√5.

Since the area of the triangle is half of this, I divide by 2. So, the area is (6√5)/2 = 3√5.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mess up signs or arithmetic when dealing with cross products.

Starting with the cross product:

i component: (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. That seems right.

j component: It's subtracted, so -( (1)(1) - (3)(-3) ) = -(1 + 9) = -10. Correct.

k component: (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. Correct.

So, OA × OB is indeed [8, -10, 4]. The magnitude squared is 8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2 = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. So, sqrt(180) is 6√5. Divided by 2, that's 3√5. So, the area is 3√5.

Just to make sure, another way to find the area is using the formula (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta), where theta is the angle between OA and OB. But since I don't know theta, the cross product method is more straightforward here.

Alternatively, I could compute the lengths of OA and OB, then use Heron's formula, but that would require finding all three sides, which might be more work. The cross product method is more efficient.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me compute the lengths of OA and OB and the angle between them, just to see if the area makes sense.

First, |OA| is sqrt(1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2) = sqrt(1 + 4 + 9) = sqrt(14).

Similarly, |OB| is sqrt((-3)^2 + (-2)^2 + 1^2) = sqrt(9 + 4 + 1) = sqrt(14).

So, both OA and OB have the same length, sqrt(14). Interesting.

Now, the angle theta between OA and OB can be found using the dot product formula: OA · OB = |OA||OB|cos(theta).

Compute OA · OB: (1)(-3) + (2)(-2) + (3)(1) = -3 -4 + 3 = -4.

So, OA · OB = -4.

Therefore, cos(theta) = (OA · OB)/(|OA||OB|) = (-4)/(sqrt(14)*sqrt(14)) = (-4)/14 = -2/7.

So, sin(theta) would be sqrt(1 - (cos(theta))^2) = sqrt(1 - (4/49)) = sqrt(45/49) = (3√5)/7.

Therefore, the area is (1/2)*|OA||OB|sin(theta) = (1/2)*(sqrt(14))*(sqrt(14))*(3√5)/7.

Simplify that: (1/2)*(14)*(3√5)/7 = (1/2)*(2)*(3√5) = 3√5.

So, same result. That's reassuring. So, whether I use the cross product method or the dot product method, I get the same area of 3√5.

Therefore, I can be confident that the area of triangle OAB is 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) given the points \( O \), \( A \), and \( B \) with position vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, we compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Calculating each component:

- The \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- The \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \)
- The \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\left| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a complex number \( z \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). I need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that expressions like \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since \( z \) is a complex number, it might be helpful to express it in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number can be written as \( z = e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). If I do that, then \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), so \( z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \). 

Wait, so in this case, \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Let me write that down:

\( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

So, dividing both sides by 2, I get:

\( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \)

Hmm, okay. So \( \theta \) is the angle whose cosine is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Let me compute that value numerically to get a sense of what angle we're dealing with. 

Calculating \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \):

\( \sqrt{5} \) is approximately 2.236, so \( 1 + \sqrt{5} \) is about 3.236. Dividing that by 4 gives approximately 0.809. So \( \cos\theta \approx 0.809 \). 

What angle has a cosine of approximately 0.809? I know that \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is about 0.8090, since \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), wait, actually, let me check that.

Wait, \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is indeed \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \):

\( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \approx \frac{2.236 + 1}{2} = \frac{3.236}{2} = 1.618 \). Wait, that can't be right because cosine can't be more than 1. Hmm, maybe I messed up.

Wait, no, actually, \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Let me compute \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \):

Wait, that's just \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2} \), which is approximately \( \frac{2.236 + 1}{2} = 1.618 \). But that's greater than 1, which is impossible for a cosine value. So maybe I made a mistake in recalling the exact value.

Wait, actually, I think \( \cos(36^\circ) \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \), but let me compute it correctly. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to recall that \( \cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \times 2 \). Wait, no, that's not correct.

Wait, let me just compute \( \cos(36^\circ) \) numerically. 36 degrees is \( \pi/5 \) radians. Calculating \( \cos(\pi/5) \):

\( \cos(\pi/5) \approx 0.8090 \), which matches the value we have for \( \cos\theta \). So, \( \theta = \pi/5 \) radians, which is 36 degrees. So, \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), since cosine is even.

Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \). So, depending on which one it is, \( z^{85} \) will be \( e^{i85\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i85\pi/5} \). Let me compute \( 85\pi/5 \):

\( 85 divided by 5 is 17, so \( 85\pi/5 = 17\pi \). Similarly, \( -85\pi/5 = -17\pi \).

So, \( z^{85} = e^{i17\pi} \) or \( e^{-i17\pi} \). Now, \( e^{i17\pi} \) is the same as \( e^{i\pi} \) because angles are periodic with period \( 2\pi \). So, \( 17\pi \) is equal to \( 8 \times 2\pi + \pi \), so it's equivalent to \( \pi \). Similarly, \( e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} \).

Therefore, \( z^{85} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \) or \( z^{85} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \). So, in either case, \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore, \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1 \).

So, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started by expressing \( z \) in polar form as \( e^{i\theta} \), which is valid because any complex number can be expressed that way.

2. Then, I used the identity \( z + 1/z = 2\cos\theta \), which is correct.

3. Plugging in the given value, I found \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \approx 0.809 \), which corresponds to \( \theta = \pi/5 \) or \( 36^\circ \). That seems right because \( \cos(\pi/5) \) is indeed approximately 0.809.

4. Then, I considered \( z^{85} \) as \( e^{i85\theta} \) or \( e^{-i85\theta} \). Since \( \theta = \pi/5 \), multiplying by 85 gives \( 17\pi \), which is an odd multiple of \( \pi \), so it's equivalent to \( \pi \) in terms of the unit circle.

5. Therefore, \( z^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \), same for the negative angle.

6. Thus, \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + (-1) = -2 \).

Wait, that seems consistent. But let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using recurrence relations or properties of powers.

Alternatively, I remember that for expressions like \( z^n + 1/z^n \), we can use the recurrence relation based on Chebyshev polynomials or using the identity:

\( z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1} = (z + 1/z)(z^n + 1/z^n) - (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1}) \)

So, if I let \( a_n = z^n + 1/z^n \), then the recurrence is:

\( a_{n+1} = (z + 1/z) a_n - a_{n-1} \)

Given that \( a_0 = z^0 + 1/z^0 = 2 \), and \( a_1 = z + 1/z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, maybe I can compute \( a_2, a_3, \ldots \) up to \( a_{85} \) using this recurrence. But that seems tedious, especially for 85 terms. Maybe there's a pattern or periodicity.

Alternatively, since \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z + 1/z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), multiplying both sides by \( z \) gives \( z^2 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z + 1 = 0 \). So, the minimal polynomial for \( z \) is \( z^2 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z + 1 = 0 \).

Therefore, \( z^2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z - 1 \). Maybe I can use this to find a recurrence relation for \( a_n \).

Wait, but I already have the recurrence relation for \( a_n \). Let me write it down:

\( a_{n+1} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} a_n - a_{n-1} \)

With \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

So, perhaps I can compute \( a_n \) using this recurrence. But computing up to \( a_{85} \) manually is impractical. Maybe I can find a pattern or find the period of \( a_n \).

Alternatively, since \( z \) is on the unit circle (because \( |z| = 1 \) since \( z + 1/z \) is real and \( z \) is a complex number), so \( z \) is a root of unity? Wait, but \( \theta = \pi/5 \), so \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), which is a primitive 10th root of unity because \( e^{i2\pi/10} = e^{i\pi/5} \). So, \( z \) is a primitive 10th root of unity.

Therefore, \( z^{10} = e^{i2\pi} = 1 \). So, \( z^{10} = 1 \), which means that \( z^{n} \) is periodic with period 10. Therefore, \( z^{85} = z^{85 \mod 10} = z^{5} \). Similarly, \( 1/z^{85} = z^{-85} = z^{-85 \mod 10} = z^{-5} \).

So, \( z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = z^5 + z^{-5} = a_5 \).

Therefore, instead of computing up to \( a_{85} \), I can compute \( a_5 \) using the recurrence.

Let me compute \( a_0 \) to \( a_5 \):

Given:
- \( a_0 = 2 \)
- \( a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

Compute \( a_2 \):
\( a_2 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} a_1 - a_0 \)
= \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 \)
= \( \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})^2}{4} - 2 \)
= \( \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 \)
= \( \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 2 \)
= \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 2 \)
= \( \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 4}{2} \)
= \( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

Compute \( a_3 \):
\( a_3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} a_2 - a_1 \)
= \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
First, compute the product:
= \( \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(-1 + \sqrt{5})}{4} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( \frac{(-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} + 5)}{4} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( \frac{(-1 + 5)}{4} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( \frac{4}{4} - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( 1 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( \frac{2 - 1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \)

Compute \( a_4 \):
\( a_4 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} a_3 - a_2 \)
= \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \times \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
First, compute the product:
= \( \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})}{4} - \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)
= \( \","[((1 - sqrt(5))*(1 + sqrt(5)))/4 - 1*(-1 + sqrt(5))/2, '\\frac{(1 + \\sqrt{5})(1 - \\sqrt{5})}{4} - \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{5}}{2}']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and its medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. I remember that the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, AG is twice as long as GD, BG is twice as long as GE, and CG is twice as long as GF.

Now, the problem says that there's a line through G that's parallel to BC, and this line intersects AB at M and AC at N. So, I need to imagine drawing a line through G that's parallel to the base BC. Since BC is the base, this line MN will be somewhere above it, cutting AB at M and AC at N.

The area of triangle ABC is given as 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, wait, triangle ENG? Let me make sure I understand the points. E is one of the midpoints because BE is a median, so E must be the midpoint of AC. Similarly, F is the midpoint of AB, and D is the midpoint of BC. So, E is the midpoint of AC, and G is the centroid.

So, triangle ENG is formed by points E, N, and G. I need to figure out the coordinates or the ratios to find the area. Maybe coordinate geometry can help here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC to make it easier.

Let's place triangle ABC such that point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (2b, 0), and point C is at (2c, 2d). I chose these coordinates because placing A at the origin might simplify calculations, and using even numbers might help with midpoints. Let me see.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 0)
- B: (2b, 0)
- C: (2c, 2d)

Now, the midpoints:
- D is the midpoint of BC, so D would be at ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)
- E is the midpoint of AC, so E would be at ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)
- F is the midpoint of AB, so F would be at ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)

The centroid G is the intersection of the medians, so its coordinates are the average of the coordinates of the vertices. So, G is at ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3) = (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3)

Now, the line through G parallel to BC. Let me find the equation of BC first. Points B and C are at (2b, 0) and (2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2(c - b)) = d/(c - b). So, the line through G parallel to BC will have the same slope, d/(c - b).

So, the equation of line MN is y - y_G = (d/(c - b))(x - x_G). Plugging in G's coordinates:

y - (2d/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2(b + c)/3))

Simplify this equation:

y = (d/(c - b))x - (d/(c - b))*(2(b + c)/3) + 2d/3

Let me compute the constants:

First term: (d/(c - b))x

Second term: -(d/(c - b))*(2(b + c)/3) = -2d(b + c)/(3(c - b))

Third term: 2d/3

So, combining the second and third terms:

-2d(b + c)/(3(c - b)) + 2d/3

Let me factor out 2d/3:

2d/3 [ - (b + c)/(c - b) + 1 ]

Simplify inside the brackets:

- (b + c)/(c - b) + 1 = [ - (b + c) + (c - b) ] / (c - b) = [ -b - c + c - b ] / (c - b) = (-2b)/(c - b)

So, the entire expression becomes:

2d/3 * (-2b)/(c - b) = (-4b d)/(3(c - b))

Therefore, the equation of line MN is:

y = (d/(c - b))x - (4b d)/(3(c - b))

Wait, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I made a mistake in simplifying. Let me double-check.

Wait, when I had:

-2d(b + c)/(3(c - b)) + 2d/3

Let me write both terms with denominator 3(c - b):

First term: -2d(b + c)/(3(c - b))

Second term: 2d/3 = 2d(c - b)/(3(c - b))

So, combining them:

[ -2d(b + c) + 2d(c - b) ] / (3(c - b)) = [ -2db - 2dc + 2dc - 2db ] / (3(c - b)) = (-4db)/(3(c - b))

So, yes, that's correct. So, the equation is:

y = (d/(c - b))x - (4b d)/(3(c - b))

Alternatively, factor out d/(c - b):

y = (d/(c - b))(x - 4b/3)

Hmm, that might be a cleaner way to write it.

Now, I need to find where this line intersects AB and AC, which are points M and N.

First, let's find point M on AB. AB is the line from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0). So, AB is along the x-axis, y = 0.

So, set y = 0 in the equation of MN:

0 = (d/(c - b))(x - 4b/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:

0 = x - 4b/3 => x = 4b/3

So, point M is at (4b/3, 0)

Wait, but AB goes from (0,0) to (2b, 0). So, 4b/3 is between 0 and 2b, which is fine.

Now, let's find point N on AC. AC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). Let me find the equation of AC.

The slope of AC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 0) = d/c. So, equation of AC is y = (d/c)x.

So, point N is the intersection of MN and AC. So, set y = (d/c)x equal to y = (d/(c - b))(x - 4b/3)

So:

(d/c)x = (d/(c - b))(x - 4b/3)

Divide both sides by d (assuming d ≠ 0, which it is since the area is 144):

(1/c)x = (1/(c - b))(x - 4b/3)

Multiply both sides by c(c - b):

(c - b)x = c(x - 4b/3)

Expand:

c x - b x = c x - (4b c)/3

Subtract c x from both sides:

- b x = - (4b c)/3

Multiply both sides by -1:

b x = (4b c)/3

Divide both sides by b (assuming b ≠ 0):

x = (4c)/3

So, x = 4c/3. Then, y = (d/c)(4c/3) = 4d/3

So, point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3)

Wait, but AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d). So, 4c/3 is between 0 and 2c, which is fine, and 4d/3 is between 0 and 2d, so that's okay.

So, now we have points M(4b/3, 0) and N(4c/3, 4d/3). Also, we have point E, which is the midpoint of AC, so E is at (c, d). And point G is at (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3).

So, triangle ENG is formed by points E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), and G(2(b + c)/3, 2d/3). I need to find the area of this triangle.

One way to find the area is to use the shoelace formula. Let me list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)
N: (4c/3, 4d/3)
G: (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3)

Let me write them in order:

E: (c, d)
N: (4c/3, 4d/3)
G: (2(b + c)/3, 2d/3)

So, applying the shoelace formula:

Area = (1/2)| (x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2)) |

Plugging in the coordinates:

x1 = c, y1 = d
x2 = 4c/3, y2 = 4d/3
x3 = 2(b + c)/3, y3 = 2d/3

Compute each term:

First term: x1(y2 - y3) = c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2c d)/3

Second term: x2(y3 - y1) = (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = (-4c d)/9

Third term: x3(y1 - y2) = (2(b + c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = (2(b + c)/3)*(-d/3) = (-2(b + c)d)/9

Now, sum these three terms:

(2c d)/3 + (-4c d)/9 + (-2(b + c)d)/9

Let me convert all terms to ninths:

(6c d)/9 - (4c d)/9 - (2b d + 2c d)/9

Combine the numerators:

6c d - 4c d - 2b d - 2c d all over 9

Simplify numerator:

(6c d - 4c d - 2c d) = 0c d, so 0 - 2b d = -2b d

So, total sum is (-2b d)/9

Take absolute value and multiply by 1/2:

Area = (1/2)*| (-2b d)/9 | = (1/2)*(2b d)/9 = (b d)/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is (b d)/9.

But wait, I need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC? Using coordinates, it's (1/2)*base*height. Alternatively, using shoelace formula:

Coordinates of ABC: A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d)

Area = (1/2)| (0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0)) | = (1/2)|0 + 4b d + 0| = (1/2)(4b d) = 2b d

Given that the area is 144, so 2b d = 144 => b d = 72

So, the area of triangle ENG is (b d)/9 = 72/9 = 8

Therefore, the area is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with coordinates, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, area of ABC: 2b d = 144 => b d = 72. Correct.

Area of ENG: (b d)/9 = 72/9 = 8. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about ratios without coordinates.

Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through centroid G, which divides the median in 2:1. So, the line MN is 1/3 of the way from the base BC to the vertex A.

Wait, actually, since G is the centroid, and MN is parallel to BC, the distance from A to MN is 2/3 the height of the triangle, and the distance from MN to BC is 1/3 the height.

Therefore, the ratio of areas would be (2/3)^2 = 4/9 for the area above MN, and (1/3)^2 = 1/9 for the area below MN.

But wait, triangle ENG is not the entire area above MN, but a specific triangle within it.

Alternatively, maybe using similar triangles.

Since MN is parallel to BC, triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC with a ratio of 2/3, because the distance from A is 2/3 the height.

Therefore, the area of triangle AMN is (2/3)^2 * 144 = 4/9 * 144 = 64.

But triangle ENG is a part of triangle AMN. Let me see.

Point E is the midpoint of AC, so in triangle AMN, point E is the midpoint of AC, which is also the midpoint of AN because N is on AC.

Wait, no, N is on AC, but E is the midpoint of AC, so E is also the midpoint of AN? Wait, no, because N is beyond E if we go from A to C.

Wait, in our coordinate system, point E is at (c, d), and point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3). So, E is between A and N.

So, from A(0,0) to E(c, d) to N(4c/3, 4d/3). So, E divides AN in the ratio of 3:1, because from A to E is (c, d), and from E to N is (4c/3 - c, 4d/3 - d) = (c/3, d/3). So, AE:EN = 3:1.

The fourth term of the sequence can be expressed as:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a terminating decimal, I first recognize that the denominator is already in the form of \(2^n \cdot 5^m\), which means the fraction can be expressed as a terminating decimal.

Next, I need to adjust the fraction so that both the numerator and the denominator have the same power of 10. The denominator has \(2^2\) and \(5^7\), so I'll multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to balance the powers of 2 and 5, resulting in a power of 10 in the denominator.

After multiplying, the fraction becomes \(\frac{21 \times 32}{10^7}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{672}{10^7}\). Finally, I place the decimal point in the numerator to match the power of 10 in the denominator, resulting in the terminating decimal 0.0000672.

"Okay, so I have this problem: For how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) is it true that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that a number is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power if it can be expressed as some integer raised to the power of \( n \). In this case, the number is \( 2^{24} \). So, I need to find all integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is equal to \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \).

Let me write that down: \( 2^{24} = k^n \). I need to find all \( n > 1 \) where this equation holds true for some integer \( k \).

Since \( 2^{24} \) is already a power of 2, maybe I can express \( k \) as a power of 2 as well. Let me assume \( k = 2^m \) where \( m \) is a positive integer. Then, substituting back into the equation, I get:

\( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \)

Simplifying the right side, that becomes:

\( 2^{24} = 2^{m \cdot n} \)

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. So:

\( 24 = m \cdot n \)

So, \( m \) and \( n \) are positive integers such that their product is 24. But we are looking for \( n > 1 \). So, essentially, I need to find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

Wait, let me think. If \( m \cdot n = 24 \), then \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. So, the number of possible \( n \) is equal to the number of positive divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

But hold on, is that correct? Let me verify.

If \( n \) is a divisor of 24, then \( m = 24 / n \) is an integer, which means \( k = 2^{24/n} \) is an integer. So, yes, each divisor \( n > 1 \) of 24 will give a valid \( k \) such that \( k^n = 2^{24} \).

Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of positive divisors of 24 that are greater than 1.

First, let me find all the positive divisors of 24. To do that, I can factorize 24 into its prime factors.

24 can be factored as \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \). The number of positive divisors is given by multiplying one more than each of the exponents in the prime factorization. So, that would be \( (3 + 1) \times (1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 = 8 \) divisors.

Let me list them out to be sure:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Yes, that's 8 divisors. Now, since we need \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1. So, the number of valid \( n \) is 7.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. If \( n = 24 \), then \( k = 2^{24/24} = 2^1 = 2 \), which is an integer. Similarly, for \( n = 12 \), \( k = 2^{24/12} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is also an integer. Same with \( n = 8 \), \( k = 2^{3} = 8 \); \( n = 6 \), \( k = 2^{4} = 16 \); \( n = 4 \), \( k = 2^{6} = 64 \); \( n = 3 \), \( k = 2^{8} = 256 \); \( n = 2 \), \( k = 2^{12} = 4096 \). All of these are integers, so each of these \( n \) values works.

So, that gives us 7 values: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

Wait, but hold on a second. Is there a possibility that \( n \) could be greater than 24? For example, could \( n = 48 \) work? Let's see: If \( n = 48 \), then \( k = 2^{24/48} = 2^{0.5} = \sqrt{2} \), which is not an integer. So, \( n \) can't be greater than 24 because that would make \( m = 24/n \) less than 1, which isn't allowed since \( m \) has to be a positive integer.

Therefore, all possible \( n \) must be divisors of 24, and since we're only considering \( n > 1 \), we have 7 such integers.

But just to make sure I haven't missed anything, let me think about the definition again. A perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power means that the exponent in the prime factorization must be divisible by \( n \). Since \( 2^{24} \) only has one prime factor, 2, the exponent 24 must be divisible by \( n \). So, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. Therefore, the number of such \( n \) is equal to the number of divisors of 24 greater than 1, which is 7.

So, I think I'm confident that the answer is 7.

**Final Answer**
The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies \( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \) for some integer \( m \), leading to the equation \( 24 = m \cdot n \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

The prime factorization of 24 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \), which has \( (3+1)(1+1) = 8 \) divisors. Listing these divisors, we get 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Excluding 1, we have 7 divisors greater than 1.

Thus, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n^{\text{th}} \) power is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

Looking at the Asymptote code, the grid has 4 columns and 5 rows, but only 3 columns are filled. This suggests that the rectangle is 3 units wide and 4 units tall.

Next, I'll analyze the shaded regions. There are two shaded areas:
1. A triangle with vertices at (0, 4), (0, 0), and (2, 0). This is a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units.

From the Asymptote code, we can see two shaded triangular regions:
1. **First Triangle:** Vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. **Second Triangle:** Vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 3: Calculate the Area of Each Triangle
The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

1. **First Triangle:**
   - **Base:** The distance between \((0, 0)\) and \((2, 0)\) is \(2\) units.
   - **Height:** The distance from \((0, 4)\) to the base is \(4\) units.
   \[
   \text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
   \]

2. **Second Triangle:**
   - **Base:** The distance between \((3, 4)\) and \((3, 0)\) is \(4\) units.
   - **Height:** The distance from \((0, 4)\) to the base is \(3\) units.
   \[
   \text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}
   \]

### Step 4: Sum the Areas
\[
\text{Total Shaded Area} = \text{Area}_1 + \text{Area}_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units}
\]

"Okay, so I have this problem: find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones. Hmm, that sounds interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that 450 is the number we're dealing with. Let me factorize 450 to understand its prime components. 450 divided by 2 is 225, then 225 divided by 3 is 75, divided by 3 again is 25, and 25 divided by 5 is 5, and then 5 divided by 5 is 1. So, the prime factors of 450 are 2 × 3² × 5². That means any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 3², and 5².

Now, the number we're looking for has to be made up entirely of zeros and ones. So, it's a binary number in terms of digits, but in base 10. That means the number can be something like 100, 101, 110, 111, etc., but only using 0s and 1s.

Let me think about the divisibility rules for 2, 3, and 5 because those will help me figure out what the number needs to look like.

Starting with divisibility by 2: a number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Since our digits can only be 0 or 1, the last digit has to be 0. So, whatever number we come up with must end with a 0.

Next, divisibility by 5: a number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is 0 or 5. But since our digits can only be 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. So, that's consistent with the divisibility by 2. So, the number must end with a 0.

Now, for divisibility by 3², which is 9. The rule for 9 is that the sum of the digits must be a multiple of 9. Since our digits are only 0s and 1s, the sum of the digits is just the number of 1s in the number. So, the number of 1s must be a multiple of 9. That means the number must have 9, 18, 27, etc., 1s.

So, putting this together, the number must end with a 0, and it must have a number of 1s that is a multiple of 9. Also, since we're looking for the smallest such number, we want the smallest number of digits possible.

So, the minimal number of 1s is 9, and since the number must end with a 0, the number will have 9 ones and at least one zero at the end. So, the number will have 10 digits in total, with 9 ones and 1 zero.

But wait, is that necessarily the case? Let me think. If the number has 9 ones and ends with a zero, it's 10 digits long. But maybe a smaller number with more zeros could also work? Hmm, but the number of 1s has to be a multiple of 9, so 9 is the smallest. So, 9 ones and 1 zero, making it 10 digits.

But let me test this. Let's consider numbers with 9 ones and 1 zero. The smallest such number would be 1111111110. Is that divisible by 450? Let's check.

First, 1111111110 divided by 450. Let me compute that. 450 times 2 is 900, 450 times 2000 is 900,000. Hmm, 450 times 2,469 is 1,111,050. Wait, that's not 1,111,111,110. Maybe I need a better approach.

Alternatively, maybe I can think about the number in terms of its divisibility by 9 and 50, since 450 is 9×50. So, if a number is divisible by both 9 and 50, it's divisible by 450.

We already know it needs to end with 00 because 50 requires the last two digits to be 00, 50, etc. But since our digits can only be 0s and 1s, the last two digits must be 00. So, actually, the number must end with two zeros. That changes things.

Wait, hold on. Divisibility by 50 requires the last two digits to be 00, 50, etc. But since we can only have 0s and 1s, the last two digits must be 00. So, the number must end with two zeros. So, that means the number has to have at least two zeros at the end.

So, that changes the structure. So, the number must end with two zeros, and the sum of the digits (number of 1s) must be a multiple of 9. So, the number will have some number of 1s followed by two zeros. But wait, not necessarily all 1s followed by two zeros, but the number can have 1s and 0s in between, but the last two digits must be 0s.

But to make the number as small as possible, we want the fewest digits possible. So, the minimal number of digits would be 11: 9 ones and 2 zeros. So, the number would be 11111111100.

But is 11111111100 divisible by 450? Let's check.

First, 11111111100 divided by 450. Let me compute 11111111100 ÷ 450.

Well, 450 × 24,700 = 11,115,000. Hmm, that's way less than 11,111,111,100. Wait, maybe I need a better way.

Alternatively, let's factorize 11111111100. It's 111111111 × 100. 111111111 is 9 ones, which is 111,111,111. 111,111,111 is known to be divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits is 9. So, 111,111,111 ÷ 9 = 12,345,679. So, 111,111,111 is 9 × 12,345,679. Therefore, 111,111,111 × 100 is 9 × 12,345,679 × 100, which is 9 × 100 × 12,345,679. So, that is 900 × 12,345,679. Therefore, 111,111,11100 is 900 × 12,345,679, which is 450 × 2 × 12,345,679. So, yes, it is divisible by 450.

But is 11111111100 the smallest such number? Maybe not. Because perhaps a smaller number with 9 ones and two zeros, but arranged differently, could be smaller.

Wait, but 11111111100 is 11 digits. Maybe there's a smaller number with fewer digits that satisfies the conditions.

Wait, let's think again. The number must end with two zeros, so the minimal number of digits is 3: 100. But 100 is 100, which is 450 × (100/450) = 450 × 2/9, which is not an integer. So, 100 is not a multiple of 450.

Similarly, 1100: 1100 ÷ 450 is approximately 2.444, not an integer. 10100: 10100 ÷ 450 ≈ 22.444, not integer. 100100: 100100 ÷ 450 ≈ 222.444, not integer. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I need to think in terms of the number of digits. Since the number must end with two zeros, the minimal number of digits is 3, but as we saw, 100 is too small. So, let's try to find the smallest number with digits 0s and 1s, ending with two zeros, and the sum of digits is a multiple of 9.

So, the number must have at least two zeros at the end, and the rest can be 1s or 0s, but the total number of 1s must be a multiple of 9.

So, the minimal number of digits is 11: 9 ones and 2 zeros. But maybe a number with fewer digits can have 9 ones and two zeros, but arranged in a way that the number is smaller.

Wait, but 11 digits is the minimal because 9 ones and 2 zeros make 11 digits. So, 11111111100 is 11 digits. Is there a smaller number with 11 digits? Or maybe a number with more digits but smaller in value?

Wait, no, because 11 digits is the minimal number of digits required to have 9 ones and 2 zeros. So, 11111111100 is the smallest 11-digit number with 9 ones and two zeros. But maybe a different arrangement of 1s and 0s in 11 digits could result in a smaller number.

Wait, for example, 1000000001100 is 13 digits, which is larger. So, 11 digits is better. So, 11111111100 is 11 digits, but is there a smaller 11-digit number with 9 ones and two zeros?

Wait, 11111111100 is 11 digits, but if we can arrange the two zeros somewhere else, maybe the number is smaller. For example, 10011111111 is 11 digits, but it's 10011111111, which is 10,011,111,111, which is smaller than 11,111,111,100. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, 10,011,111,111 is 10 billion something, while 11,111,111,100 is 11 billion something. So, yes, 10,011,111,111 is smaller. But does that number satisfy the conditions?

Let me check. 10,011,111,111: sum of digits is 1+0+0+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1 = 1+8 = 9. So, sum is 9, which is good for divisibility by 9. It ends with two zeros? Wait, no, it ends with 11. So, it doesn't end with two zeros. So, it's not divisible by 100, hence not divisible by 50, hence not divisible by 450.

So, that number is not a multiple of 450. So, we can't have that.

So, the number must end with two zeros. So, the last two digits must be 00. So, the number must be something like ...00. So, the two zeros are at the end.

Therefore, the smallest 11-digit number with 9 ones and two zeros at the end is 11111111100. But is that the smallest possible?

Wait, maybe a number with fewer digits can have 9 ones and two zeros, but arranged in a way that the number is smaller. But wait, 9 ones and two zeros make 11 digits. So, you can't have fewer digits than 11 if you have 9 ones and two zeros. So, 11 digits is the minimal.

But wait, maybe a number with more than 11 digits could be smaller? For example, 100000000000 (12 digits) is 100 billion, which is larger than 11,111,111,100. So, no, 11 digits is better.

Wait, but 11111111100 is 11,111,111,100. Is there a smaller 11-digit number with 9 ones and two zeros at the end?

Wait, if we can place the two zeros somewhere else, but still have the last two digits as zeros. Wait, no, because the last two digits must be zeros. So, the two zeros are fixed at the end. So, the first nine digits must be 1s. So, the number is 11111111100.

Wait, but is that the case? Or can we have some zeros in the middle and still have the last two digits as zeros? For example, 111111110100. But that's 12 digits, which is larger. So, no, 11 digits is better.

Wait, but 11111111100 is 11 digits, but maybe a number with 18 ones and two zeros is smaller? No, because 18 ones would make the number longer, hence larger.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently.

Since the number must be divisible by 450, which is 2 × 3² × 5², it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

We already considered that it must end with two zeros for divisibility by 25 (since 25 requires the last two digits to be 00","[0, '0']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a wheel with numbers, and when you spin it twice, you get two numbers. The first number is divided by 4, and the remainder determines the column on a checkerboard. The second number is divided by 5, and the remainder determines the row. Then, a checker is placed on that square, and I need to find the probability that it lands on a shaded square.

First, let me try to visualize the wheel. The Asymptote code shows a wheel with numbers 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9. So, the wheel has six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9. Each number is equally likely, so each has a probability of 1/6 when spun.

When you spin the wheel twice, the first spin gives a number which is divided by 4, and the remainder determines the column. The columns are labeled 1, 2, 3. Similarly, the second spin gives a number which is divided by 5, and the remainder determines the row, which are labeled 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, the checkerboard has 3 columns and 4 rows, making 12 squares in total. The Asymptote code also shows some shaded squares. From the code, it looks like the shaded squares are at positions:

- (3,0) to (4,1): So, column 3, row 1
- (3,-2) to (4,-1): Column 3, row 4
- (4,1) to (5,2): Column 4, row 4? Wait, hold on, the columns are 3, 4, 5, and rows are -2, -1, 0, 1, 2? Wait, maybe I need to parse the Asymptote code more carefully.

Wait, the Asymptote code draws the checkerboard from (3,-2) to (6,2). So, the checkerboard is 3 units wide (from 3 to 6) and 4 units tall (from -2 to 2). Each square is 1 unit. So, the columns are at x=3,4,5, and the rows are at y=-2,-1,0,1,2. But the labels on the checkerboard are:

- Columns labeled 1,2,3 at the bottom (y=-2)
- Rows labeled 1,2,3,4 on the left (x=3)

Wait, so the columns are 1,2,3 from left to right (x=3,4,5) and the rows are 1,2,3,4 from bottom to top (y=-2,-1,0,1). So, the shaded squares are:

Looking at the Asymptote code:

- fill((3,0)--(3,1)--(4,1)--(4,0)--cycle,gray(0.7)); So, column 1 (x=3), row 3 (y=0 to 1)
- fill((3,-2)--(3,-1)--(4,-1)--(4,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7)); Column 1, row 1 (y=-2 to -1)
- fill((4,1)--(4,2)--(5,2)--(5,1)--cycle,gray(0.7)); Column 2, row 4 (y=1 to 2)
- fill((4,-1)--(4,0)--(5,0)--(5,-1)--cycle,gray(0.7)); Column 2, row 2 (y=-1 to 0)
- fill((5,0)--(5,1)--(6,1)--(6,0)--cycle,gray(0.7)); Column 3, row 3 (y=0 to 1)
- fill((5,-2)--(5,-1)--(6,-1)--(6,-2)--cycle,gray(0.7)); Column 3, row 1 (y=-2 to -1)

So, the shaded squares are:

- Column 1, Row 1
- Column 1, Row 3
- Column 2, Row 2
- Column 2, Row 4
- Column 3, Row 1
- Column 3, Row 3

So, in total, 6 shaded squares out of 12. Wait, but hold on, the checkerboard is 3 columns and 4 rows, so 12 squares. But the shaded squares are 6, so is the probability 1/2? But that might not be the case because the mapping from the wheel spins to the columns and rows isn't uniform.

Wait, no, because the first spin determines the column based on modulo 4, and the second spin determines the row based on modulo 5. So, the probability distribution for columns and rows isn't uniform because the numbers on the wheel aren't equally distributed modulo 4 and 5.

So, I need to figure out the probability distribution for the columns and rows.

First, let's list the numbers on the wheel: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 9.

First spin: number divided by 4, remainder determines column (1,2,3). So, let's compute the remainders when each number is divided by 4.

- 1 mod 4 = 1
- 2 mod 4 = 2
- 3 mod 4 = 3
- 6 mod 4 = 2 (since 6-4=2)
- 7 mod 4 = 3 (since 7-4*1=3)
- 9 mod 4 = 1 (since 9-4*2=1)

So, mapping each number to column:

- 1: column 1
- 2: column 2
- 3: column 3
- 6: column 2
- 7: column 3
- 9: column 1

So, the possible columns and their probabilities:

- Column 1: numbers 1,9 => 2 numbers => probability 2/6 = 1/3
- Column 2: numbers 2,6 => 2 numbers => probability 1/3
- Column 3: numbers 3,7 => 2 numbers => probability 1/3

Wait, so each column has equal probability? That's interesting. So, columns 1,2,3 each have probability 1/3.

Now, for the rows: second spin, number divided by 5, remainder determines row (1,2,3,4). Let's compute the remainders for each number:

- 1 mod 5 = 1
- 2 mod 5 = 2
- 3 mod 5 = 3
- 6 mod 5 = 1 (since 6-5=1)
- 7 mod 5 = 2 (since 7-5=2)
- 9 mod 5 = 4 (since 9-5*1=4)

So, mapping each number to row:

- 1: row 1
- 2: row 2
- 3: row 3
- 6: row 1
- 7: row 2
- 9: row 4

So, the possible rows and their probabilities:

- Row 1: numbers 1,6 => 2 numbers => probability 2/6 = 1/3
- Row 2: numbers 2,7 => 2 numbers => probability 1/3
- Row 3: number 3 => 1 number => probability 1/6
- Row 4: number 9 => 1 number => probability 1/6

So, rows 1 and 2 have probability 1/3 each, and rows 3 and 4 have probability 1/6 each.

So, now, the checkerboard has 3 columns and 4 rows, each column with probability 1/3, each row with different probabilities.

Now, the shaded squares are:

- Column 1, Row 1
- Column 1, Row 3
- Column 2, Row 2
- Column 2, Row 4
- Column 3, Row 1
- Column 3, Row 3

So, 6 shaded squares. But since the columns and rows have different probabilities, the probability of landing on each square isn't uniform.

So, to find the total probability, I need to compute the probability for each shaded square and sum them up.

Each square is determined by a column and a row. The probability of landing on a specific column and row is the product of their individual probabilities.

So, let's compute the probability for each shaded square:

1. Column 1, Row 1: P(Column 1) * P(Row 1) = (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9
2. Column 1, Row 3: (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18
3. Column 2, Row 2: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9
4. Column 2, Row 4: (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18
5. Column 3, Row 1: (1/3) * (1/3) = 1/9
6. Column 3, Row 3: (1/3) * (1/6) = 1/18

Now, let's sum these probabilities:

1/9 + 1/18 + 1/9 + 1/18 + 1/9 + 1/18

Let me convert all to eighteenths to add them up:

1/9 = 2/18

So:

2/18 + 1/18 + 2/18 + 1/18 + 2/18 + 1/18 = (2+1+2+1+2+1)/18 = 9/18 = 1/2

Wait, so the total probability is 1/2? That seems high, but considering that half of the squares are shaded, but the probabilities aren't uniform, but in this case, the way the columns and rows are distributed, it still averages out to 1/2.

But let me double-check my calculations.

First, the columns: each column is 1/3, correct.

Rows: rows 1 and 2 are 1/3 each, rows 3 and 4 are 1/6 each, correct.

Shaded squares:

- Column 1, Row 1: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9
- Column 1, Row 3: 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/18
- Column 2, Row 2: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9
- Column 2, Row 4: 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/18
- Column 3, Row 1: 1/3 * 1/3 = 1/9
- Column 3, Row 3: 1/3 * 1/6 = 1/18

Adding them up:

1/9 + 1/18 + 1/9 + 1/18 + 1/9 + 1/18

Convert to eighteenths:

2/18 + 1/18 + 2/18 + 1/18 + 2/18 + 1/18 = (2+1+2+1+2+1)/18 = 9/18 = 1/2

So, yes, 1/2.

But wait, is that correct? Because the shaded squares are 6 out of 12, but the probability isn't necessarily 1/2 because the mapping isn't uniform.

Wait, but in this case, the columns are uniform (each 1/3), and the rows have different probabilities, but when we compute the total probability, it still comes out to 1/2.

Alternatively, maybe it's because the shaded squares are symmetric in some way.

Looking at the shaded squares:

- For column 1: rows 1 and 3
- For column 2: rows 2 and 4
- For column 3: rows 1 and 3

So, in each column, two rows are shaded, but the rows have different probabilities.

But when we compute the probability, each column contributes (1/3) * (probability of shaded rows in that column). For column 1, shaded rows are 1 and 3, which have probabilities 1/3 and 1/6, so total for column 1: 1/3*(1/3 + 1/6) = 1/3*(1/2) = 1/6

Similarly, column 2: shaded rows 2 and 4, which are 1/3 and 1/6, so same as column 1: 1/3*(1/3 + 1/6) = 1/6

Column 3: shaded rows 1 and 3, same as column 1: 1/3*(1/3 + 1/6) = 1/6

So, total probability: 1/6 + 1/6 + 1/6 = 1/2

Yes, that's another way to see it. Each column contributes 1/6, so total 1/2.

So, the probability is 1/2.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a different way to approach this?

Alternatively, since the columns are equally likely (each 1/3), and within each column, the shaded rows have certain probabilities.

But in each column, the shaded rows are 1 and 3 for columns 1 and 3, and 2 and 4 for column 2.

So, for column 1: shaded rows 1 and 3. The probability of row 1 is 1/3, row 3 is 1/6. So, total shaded probability in column 1: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2. Then, since column 1 is 1/3, the contribution is 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Similarly, column 2: shaded rows 2 and 4. Row 2 is 1/3, row 4 is 1/6. So, total shaded probability in column 2: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2. Contribution: 1/3 * 1/2 = 1/6.

Column 3: same as column 1: shaded rows 1 and 3, total shaded probability 1/2, contribution 1/6.

So, total probability: 1/6 + 1","[1/6 + 1, '1/6 + 1']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"Okay, so I have this fraction, 4321 over 5 to the power of 7 multiplied by 2 to the power of 8. I need to find the sum of the digits in its terminating decimal representation. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that any fraction where the denominator is a product of powers of 2 and 5 will have a terminating decimal. That makes sense because the prime factors of the denominator are only 2s and 5s, which are the same as the base-10 system. So, this fraction should definitely terminate.

Now, the denominator is 5^7 * 2^8. I think to convert this fraction into a decimal, I need to make the denominator a power of 10 because that's how decimals work. Since 10 is 2*5, I can pair the 2s and 5s to make 10s. But here, the exponents are different: 5^7 and 2^8. So, I can pair 7 of the 2s with the 7 5s to make 10^7, and then I'll have one 2 left over.

Let me write that down:

Denominator: 5^7 * 2^8 = (5^7 * 2^7) * 2^(8-7) = 10^7 * 2^1 = 10^7 * 2.

So, the denominator becomes 2 * 10^7. That means the fraction is 4321 divided by (2 * 10^7). I can rewrite this as (4321 / 2) divided by 10^7.

Calculating 4321 divided by 2: 4321 ÷ 2. Let me do that division. 2 goes into 4 twice, 2 into 3 once with a remainder of 1, 2 into 12 six times, and 2 into 1 once with a remainder of 1. Wait, that doesn't seem right. Let me do it step by step.

4321 divided by 2:

- 2 goes into 4 two times, write 2.
- Bring down the 3. 2 goes into 3 once, write 1, remainder 1.
- Bring down the 2. 12 divided by 2 is 6, write 6.
- Bring down the 1. 1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1.

Wait, that gives me 2160.5. Hmm, but 2 times 2160 is 4320, so 4321 is 2160.5. Yeah, that's correct.

So, 4321 / 2 = 2160.5. Therefore, the fraction becomes 2160.5 / 10^7.

Dividing by 10^7 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. So, starting from 2160.5, moving the decimal seven places left would give me 0.00021605.

Wait, let me check that. 2160.5 divided by 10 is 216.05, divided by 10 again is 21.605, again is 2.1605, again is 0.21605, again is 0.021605, again is 0.0021605, and again is 0.00021605. Yeah, that's seven places. So, the decimal representation is 0.00021605.

Now, I need to find the sum of the digits in this decimal. Let's write it out: 0.00021605.

Breaking it down digit by digit after the decimal point:

- The first digit is 0.
- Second digit: 0
- Third digit: 0
- Fourth digit: 2
- Fifth digit: 1
- Sixth digit: 6
- Seventh digit: 0
- Eighth digit: 5

So, the digits after the decimal are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. Let me add them up:

0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5.

Calculating that: 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 2+1=3, 3+6=9, 9+0=9, 9+5=14.

So, the sum of the digits is 14.

Wait, let me double-check the decimal expansion. 4321/(5^7*2^8). Alternatively, maybe I can represent the fraction differently.

Another approach: Since the denominator is 5^7 * 2^8, I can write the fraction as (4321 * 2^(8-7)) / (10^7). Because 5^7 * 2^7 is 10^7, and we have an extra 2^1.

So, 4321 * 2 = 8642. Then, 8642 / 10^7 is 0.0008642. Wait, that's different from what I had before. Hmm, which one is correct?

Wait, hold on. Let me recast the original fraction:

4321 / (5^7 * 2^8) = 4321 / (2^8 * 5^7). To make the denominator a power of 10, I need to have equal numbers of 2s and 5s. Since there are more 2s, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(8-7) = 5^1 to balance it.

Wait, no, actually, to make the denominator 10^8, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by 5^(8-7) = 5^1. So, 4321 * 5 / (5^8 * 2^8) = (4321 * 5) / 10^8.

Calculating 4321 * 5: 4321 * 5. Let's compute that.

4321 * 5:

- 1 * 5 = 5
- 2 * 5 = 10, carryover 1
- 3 * 5 = 15 + 1 = 16, carryover 1
- 4 * 5 = 20 + 1 = 21

So, 4321 * 5 = 21605.

Therefore, the fraction becomes 21605 / 10^8, which is 0.21605 when divided by 10^5, but wait, 10^8 is 100,000,000. So, 21605 divided by 100,000,000 is 0.00021605.

Wait, that's the same as before. So, 0.00021605. So, the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. So, adding them up: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.

But earlier, when I thought of multiplying numerator and denominator by 2, I got 8642 / 10^7, which is 0.0008642. That's different. So, which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I made a mistake in that approach. Let me see.

Original fraction: 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8). To make denominator 10^n, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(7) * 5^(8-7)=2^7*5^1.

Wait, no, that might complicate. Alternatively, since denominator is 5^7 * 2^8, which is 2^8 * 5^7, so to make it 10^7, I need to multiply numerator and denominator by 2^(8-7)=2^1.

So, 4321 * 2 / (5^7 * 2^8 * 2^1) = 8642 / (5^7 * 2^9). Wait, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I should think of it as 4321 / (2^8 * 5^7) = (4321 / 2^8) / 5^7.

But 4321 divided by 2^8 is 4321 / 256. Let me compute that.

4321 ÷ 256. Let's see:

256 * 16 = 4096. 4321 - 4096 = 225. So, 16 with a remainder of 225.

225 / 256 is 0.87890625.

So, 4321 / 256 = 16.87890625.

Then, divide that by 5^7. 5^7 is 78125.

So, 16.87890625 / 78125. Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps my first method was correct. Let me stick with that.

So, 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8) = (4321 * 2) / (10^7 * 2) = 8642 / 10^8, which is 0.0008642. Wait, that's conflicting with the previous result.

Wait, no, 4321 / (5^7 * 2^8) = (4321 / 2) / (5^7 * 2^7) = 2160.5 / 10^7 = 0.00021605.

Yes, that seems correct. So, 0.00021605.

Wait, so why did I get confused earlier? Because when I multiplied numerator and denominator by 2, I thought it was 8642 / 10^7, but actually, 5^7 * 2^8 is 10^7 * 2, so 4321 / (10^7 * 2) is 4321 / 2 divided by 10^7, which is 2160.5 / 10^7, which is 0.00021605.

So, that's correct. So, the decimal is 0.00021605.

Therefore, the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. So, adding them: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.

Wait, but when I thought of multiplying numerator and denominator by 5, I got 21605 / 10^8, which is 0.00021605 as well. So, same result.

So, both methods give me the same decimal. So, the sum is 14.

But just to be thorough, let me compute 4321 divided by (5^7 * 2^8) using another method.

Compute denominator: 5^7 is 78125, 2^8 is 256. So, 78125 * 256. Let me compute that.

78125 * 256. Let's break it down:

78125 * 200 = 15,625,000

78125 * 50 = 3,906,250

78125 * 6 = 468,750

Adding them together: 15,625,000 + 3,906,250 = 19,531,250; 19,531,250 + 468,750 = 20,000,000.

Wait, 78125 * 256 = 20,000,000? Let me check:

256 * 78125. Since 256 is 2^8 and 78125 is 5^7, their product is 2^8 * 5^7 = 2*(2^7 * 5^7) = 2*10^7 = 20,000,000. Yes, that's correct.

So, denominator is 20,000,000. So, 4321 / 20,000,000.

Compute 4321 divided by 20,000,000.

Well, 4321 / 20,000,000 = (4321 / 20) / 1,000,000.

4321 divided by 20 is 216.05. So, 216.05 / 1,000,000 is 0.00021605.

So, same result. So, the decimal is 0.00021605.

Therefore, the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. So, adding them: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.

So, the sum is 14.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me write out the decimal: 0.00021605.

So, counting the digits:

1st place: 0

2nd: 0

3rd: 0

4th: 2

5th: 1

6th: 6

7th: 0

8th: 5

So, digits are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Sum is 0+0+0+2+","[0, '0+0+0+2+']",14,"[14, '14']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem: I need to find the product of sines at various angles: sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, and sin160°. That's eight sine terms multiplied together. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help simplify this.

First, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities. But with eight terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that products of sines at equally spaced angles can sometimes be expressed in terms of multiple angles or using complex numbers. Let me think about that.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. These angles are all multiples of 20°, right? So, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. That's 20° times 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. So, it's like 20° times k, where k goes from 1 to 8. Interesting.

Wait, so maybe I can write this product as the product of sin(20°k) for k from 1 to 8. So, that's sin20°, sin40°, ..., sin160°. Hmm, I wonder if there's a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles.

I remember that for n angles, the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1 is equal to sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}. But in this case, the angles are in degrees, not radians, and they're not exactly of the form kπ/(2n). Let me check.

Wait, 20° is π/9 radians, right? Because 180° is π radians, so 20° is π/9. So, 20°, 40°, ..., 160° correspond to π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9. So, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(3π/9) ... sin(8π/9). Hmm, that's interesting.

I think there's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/n) for k from 1 to n-1. Let me recall. I think it's something like n/(2^{n-1}). Wait, is that right? Let me check for n=3. The product sin(π/3) sin(2π/3) is (sqrt(3)/2)(sqrt(3)/2) = 3/4. And n/(2^{n-1}) would be 3/(2^2) = 3/4. So that works. For n=4, the product sin(π/4) sin(2π/4) sin(3π/4) is (sqrt(2)/2)(1)(sqrt(2)/2) = (2/4)(1) = 1/2. And n/(2^{n-1}) is 4/(2^3) = 4/8 = 1/2. That also works. So, seems like the formula is correct.

But in our case, n would be 9, since the angles are multiples of π/9. So, the product sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) ... sin(8π/9) would be 9/(2^8) = 9/256. But wait, in our problem, the product is sin20° sin40° ... sin160°, which is exactly sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) ... sin(8π/9). So, according to this formula, the product should be 9/256.

But wait, hold on. Let me make sure. The formula is for the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1, which is n/(2^{n-1}). So, for n=9, it's 9/(2^8) = 9/256. So, that would be the product of sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) ... sin(8π/9). So, that's exactly our product. So, is the answer 9/256?

Wait, but let me double-check because sometimes these formulas have different exponents or factors. Let me see. I think the formula is indeed n/(2^{n-1}) for the product of sin(kπ/n) from k=1 to n-1. So, for n=9, it's 9/256. So, that should be the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me see if I can derive this formula or at least understand why it's true. Maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity.

I remember that the product of sin(kπ/n) can be related to the roots of the equation sin(nθ) = 0, which are θ = kπ/n for k=1,2,...,n-1. So, maybe using the identity for sin(nθ) in terms of multiple angles.

Alternatively, I recall that the product formula for sine can be derived using the identity:

sin(nθ) = 2^{n-1} product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(θ + (kπ)/n)

But I might be mixing up some formulas here. Alternatively, I remember that the product of sines can be connected to the determinant of a certain matrix or using properties of polynomials.

Wait, another approach: using the identity that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). So, if n=9, then the product is 9/(2^8) = 9/256. So, that seems consistent.

But just to make sure, let me compute the product numerically and see if it's approximately 9/256.

Compute 9 divided by 256: 9 ÷ 256 ≈ 0.03515625.

Now, let me compute the product step by step:

First, compute sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, sin160°.

Compute each sine:

sin20° ≈ 0.3420

sin40° ≈ 0.6428

sin60° ≈ 0.8660

sin80° ≈ 0.9848

sin100° ≈ 0.9848

sin120° ≈ 0.8660

sin140° ≈ 0.6428

sin160° ≈ 0.3420

Now, multiply them all together:

0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198

0.2198 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1903

0.1903 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1878

0.1878 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1853

0.1853 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1606

0.1606 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.1033

0.1033 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0353

So, the approximate product is about 0.0353, which is very close to 9/256 ≈ 0.03515625. So, that seems to confirm the result.

Therefore, the exact value is 9/256.

Wait, but let me think again. The formula I used was for the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1, which is n/(2^{n-1}). So, in our case, n=9, so the product is 9/256. So, that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me see if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using pairing terms or using some symmetry.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. Notice that sin(180° - x) = sinx. So, sin160° = sin20°, sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, sin100° = sin80°. So, the product can be written as [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2.

So, the original product is equal to [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. So, if I can compute sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, then square it, I can get the result.

Alternatively, maybe compute sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° first.

Let me compute that.

First, sin60° is sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, the product is sin20° sin40° sin80° * sin60°.

Wait, sin20° sin40° sin80° is a known product. I think there's a formula for sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4. Let me check.

Yes, the identity is sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.

So, if I let A = 20°, then sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sin60°)/4.

Wait, sin3A where A=20°, so sin60°, which is sqrt(3)/2. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8.

So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8.

Therefore, the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° is (sqrt(3)/8) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (3/16).

So, that product is 3/16. Therefore, the original product is [3/16]^2 = 9/256.

So, that's another way to get the same result. So, that confirms it.

Alternatively, I could have used the identity for the product of four sines, but in this case, recognizing the pairing and using the identity for three sines made it easier.

So, in summary, the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160° is equal to [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2, which is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Therefore, the answer is 9/256.

**Final Answer**
The value of the product is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}.
</think>

To find the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the identity for the product of sines of equally spaced angles.

First, we note that the angles \(20^\circ, 40^\circ, 60^\circ, 80^\circ, 100^\circ, 120^\circ, 140^\circ, 160^\circ\) are all multiples of \(20^\circ\). These correspond to \(\sin(20^\circ k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 8\).

Using the identity for the product of sines of the form \(\sin(k\pi/n)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, n-1\), which is given by \(\frac{n}{2^{n-1}}\), we recognize that the product of \(\sin(20^\circ k)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 8\) is equivalent to the product of \(\sin(k\pi/9)\) for \(k = 1, 2, \ldots, 8\). Here, \(n = 9\), so the product is \(\frac{9}{2^8} = \frac{9}{256}\).

Additionally, we can verify this by recognizing the symmetry in the sine function, where \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to pair the terms and simplify the product. Using the identity for the product of sines, we find that the product of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\) is \(\frac{3}{16}\), and squaring this result gives \(\left(\frac{3}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}\).

Thus, the value of the product is \(\boxed{\dfrac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here about cylindrical coordinates, and I need to figure out what shape is described by the equation \( z = c \). The options are Line, Circle, Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, or Cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point in space is defined by these three components.

Now, the equation given is \( z = c \). That means, for any point on this shape, the z-coordinate is fixed at some constant value \( c \). I need to visualize what this looks like in 3D space.

In Cartesian coordinates, if I have an equation like \( z = c \), that's a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But wait, in cylindrical coordinates, does this equation represent the same thing?

Let me recall how cylindrical coordinates relate to Cartesian. The conversion formulas are:
- \( x = r \cos \theta \)
- \( y = r \sin \theta \)
- \( z = z \)

So, the z-coordinate is the same in both systems. That means if \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates, it's the same as \( z = c \) in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, it should represent a plane.

But hold on, let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. For example, if the equation was \( r = c \), that would be a cylinder with radius \( c \) extending infinitely along the z-axis. Similarly, if it was \( \theta = c \), that would be a vertical plane making an angle \( c \) with the x-axis.

But in this case, it's \( z = c \), which doesn't involve \( r \) or \( \theta \). So, regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is fixed, the shape is a plane. It doesn't curve or anything; it's flat and extends infinitely in all directions perpendicular to the z-axis.

Let me think about the options again. The options are Line, Circle, Plane, Sphere, Cylinder, Cone. So, Plane is one of them, which is option (C). But just to be thorough, let me consider each option:

- Line: A line would require two coordinates to be fixed, like \( x = c \) and \( y = d \), but here only \( z \) is fixed, so it's not a line.
- Circle: A circle in cylindrical coordinates would have \( r = c \) and \( z \) fixed, but here \( z \) is fixed without any restriction on \( r \), so it's not a circle.
- Plane: As I thought earlier, \( z = c \) is a plane.
- Sphere: A sphere would involve \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \) or something similar, so that's not the case here.
- Cylinder: A cylinder is when \( r = c \), which is different from \( z = c \).
- Cone: A cone would involve a relationship between \( r \) and \( z \), like \( z = kr \), so that's not it either.

So, after going through each option, I'm confident that \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane. Therefore, the correct answer should be (C) Plane.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{C}
</think>

In cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), the equation \(z = c\) specifies that the height \(z\) is fixed at a constant value \(c\). This is equivalent to the equation \(z = c\) in Cartesian coordinates, which represents a horizontal plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane at height \(c\). 

Thus, the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is (3, 2, 6). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors has a magnitude equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta), where theta is the angle between them. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can solve for sin(theta) and then find theta.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector. The cross product is (3, 2, 6), so its magnitude is sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me compute that: 3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those up: 9 + 4 is 13, plus 36 is 49. So the magnitude is sqrt(49), which is 7. Okay, so ||a × b|| is 7.

Now, plugging into the formula: 7 = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta). We know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so that becomes 7 = 2 * 7 * sin(theta). Simplifying the right side: 2 * 7 is 14, so 7 = 14 sin(theta). Dividing both sides by 14: sin(theta) = 7 / 14, which simplifies to sin(theta) = 0.5.

Now, I need to find the angle theta where sin(theta) is 0.5. I remember that sin(30°) is 0.5, so theta is 30 degrees. But wait, the question asks for the smallest possible angle between a and b. Since the sine function is positive in both the first and second quadrants, the angle could be 30 degrees or 150 degrees. But since we're looking for the smallest angle, it must be 30 degrees.

Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Calculated the magnitude of the cross product correctly: sqrt(9 + 4 + 36) = sqrt(49) = 7. Then used the formula ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta), substituted the values correctly: 7 = 2*7*sin(theta) => sin(theta) = 0.5. Then, yes, sin(theta) = 0.5 corresponds to 30 degrees, which is the smallest angle. So, I think that's correct.

I don't think I made any calculation errors here. The cross product magnitude was straightforward, and the formula application seems right. So, yeah, the smallest possible angle is 30 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product, \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)\), we substitute the known values:

\[
7 = 14 \sin(\theta)

\[

"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the roots of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The function f is given by f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for any polynomial, the sum of its roots can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial like f(x) = ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, in this case, for f(x), the sum of the roots would be -(-49)/1, which is 49. But wait, the question is about g(x), not f(x). So, I need to figure out how shifting the function affects the roots.

Since g(x) = f(x + 5), this means that the graph of f(x) is shifted 5 units to the left. So, if f(x) has roots at some points, say r1, r2, r3, then g(x) will have roots at r1 - 5, r2 - 5, r3 - 5. Because if f(x + 5) = 0, then x + 5 must be a root of f, so x is a root of g.

Therefore, the roots of g(x) are each 5 less than the roots of f(x). So, if the sum of the roots of f(x) is 49, then the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (r1 - 5) + (r2 - 5) + (r3 - 5) = (r1 + r2 + r3) - 15. Since r1 + r2 + r3 is 49, subtracting 15 gives 34. So, the sum of the roots of g(x) should be 34.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not making a mistake here. Another way to think about it is to actually compute g(x) by substituting x + 5 into f(x). Let me try that.

So, f(x + 5) = (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let me expand each term step by step.

First, (x + 5)³. I know that (a + b)³ = a³ + 3a²b + 3ab² + b³. So, substituting a = x and b = 5:

(x + 5)³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, -49(x + 5)². Let's compute (x + 5)² first: that's x² + 10x + 25. Then multiply by -49:

-49(x² + 10x + 25) = -49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, 623(x + 5) is straightforward: 623x + 3115.

And finally, subtract 2015.

So, putting it all together:

g(x) = (x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.

Now, let's combine like terms.

First, the x³ term: just x³.

Next, the x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².

Then, the x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 is 208. So, 208x.

Finally, the constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, so g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. So, in standard form, it's x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0.

Now, to find the sum of the roots of g(x), we can use Vieta's formula again. For a cubic polynomial ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. Here, a is 1, and b is -34. So, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34.

So, that confirms my earlier conclusion. The sum of the roots of g(x) is 34.

Alternatively, another way to think about it without expanding is that shifting the polynomial horizontally doesn't change the sum of the roots in a straightforward way, but since each root is shifted by -5, the total sum decreases by 3*5=15. Since the original sum was 49, subtracting 15 gives 34.

Either way, I get the same answer, so I feel confident that 34 is the correct sum of the roots of g(x).

**Final Answer**
The sum of the roots of \( g \) is \boxed{34}.
</think>

To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by noting that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \). 

Using Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by the coefficient of \( x^2 \) term divided by the coefficient of \( x^3 \) term, which is \( \frac{49}{1} = 49 \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are each 5 less than the roots of \( f(x) \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) minus \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \).

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \( 49 - 15 = 34 \).

To confirm, we can expand \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \):

\[
f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Expanding each term:

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]
\[
-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225
\]
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]

Combining all terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015
\]

Simplifying:

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x
\]

Using Vieta's formula again, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \( \frac{34}{1} = 34 \).

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem to compute the sum of three reciprocals of squared trigonometric functions: \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}\) is equal to \(\sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\) is \(\csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

I also recall some trigonometric identities that might be useful here. For example, the identity for \(\sec^2 \theta\) is \(1 + \tan^2 \theta\), and for \(\csc^2 \theta\), it's \(1 + \cot^2 \theta\). Maybe I can express everything in terms of tangent and cotangent to see if something simplifies.

So, substituting these identities in, the expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Simplifying that, I get:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, so now I have three terms: 3, \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), and two \(\cot^2\) terms. I wonder if there's a relationship between these angles that can help me simplify further. Let me note the angles: 10°, 20°, and 40°. These are all multiples of 10°, and 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are related through doubling or halving. Maybe there's a way to use angle addition or multiple-angle identities.

Another thought: perhaps using the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\) or something similar since 10°, 20°, and 40° are related through tripling or something. Let me recall that \(\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}\). Maybe if I set \(\theta = 10^\circ\), then \(3\theta = 30^\circ\), which is a nice angle. Let me try that.

Let’s compute \(\tan 30^\circ\). I know that \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\). So, using the identity:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\) to make it easier. Then the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{3t - t^3}{1 - 3t^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\]

Cross-multiplying:

\[
(3t - t^3)\sqrt{3} = 1 - 3t^2
\]

Expanding the left side:

\[
3\sqrt{3} t - \sqrt{3} t^3 = 1 - 3t^2
\]

Let me bring all terms to one side:

\[
-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3\sqrt{3} t + 3t^2 - 1 = 0
\]

Hmm, that's a cubic equation in terms of \(t\). Maybe I can factor this or find a substitution. Let me rearrange the terms:

\[
-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3t^2 + 3\sqrt{3} t - 1 = 0
\]

This seems complicated. Maybe I can factor out a common term or use substitution. Let me try to factor by grouping:

Group the first two terms and the last two terms:

\[
(-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3t^2) + (3\sqrt{3} t - 1) = 0
\]

Factor out \(t^2\) from the first group:

\[
t^2(-\sqrt{3} t + 3) + (3\sqrt{3} t - 1) = 0
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another approach. Alternatively, perhaps I can let \(u = t\sqrt{3}\), so \(t = \frac{u}{\sqrt{3}}\). Let me substitute that into the equation:

First, compute each term:

- \(t = \frac{u}{\sqrt{3}}\)
- \(t^2 = \frac{u^2}{3}\)
- \(t^3 = \frac{u^3}{3\sqrt{3}}\)

Substituting into the equation:

\[
-\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{u^3}{3\sqrt{3}}\right) + 3\left(\frac{u^2}{3}\right) + 3\sqrt{3} \left(\frac{u}{\sqrt{3}}\right) - 1 = 0
\]

Simplify each term:

- First term: \(-\sqrt{3} \times \frac{u^3}{3\sqrt{3}} = -\frac{u^3}{3}\)
- Second term: \(3 \times \frac{u^2}{3} = u^2\)
- Third term: \(3\sqrt{3} \times \frac{u}{\sqrt{3}} = 3u\)
- Fourth term: \(-1\)

So the equation becomes:

\[
-\frac{u^3}{3} + u^2 + 3u - 1 = 0
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
-u^3 + 3u^2 + 9u - 3 = 0
\]

Hmm, still a cubic, but maybe it's factorable. Let me try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 3 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±3.

Testing u=1:

\[
-1 + 3 + 9 - 3 = 8 ≠ 0
\]

u=3:

\[
-27 + 27 + 27 - 3 = 24 ≠ 0
\]

u=-1:

\[
1 + 3 - 9 - 3 = -8 ≠ 0
\]

u=-3:

\[
27 + 27 - 27 - 3 = 24 ≠ 0
\]

Hmm, none of these work. Maybe this substitution didn't help. Perhaps another approach is needed.

Wait, maybe instead of trying to find \(\tan 10^\circ\), I can relate the angles 10°, 20°, and 40° through some identity. Let me think about the sum of angles. 10° + 20° + 40° = 70°, which isn't particularly special. Alternatively, 10°, 20°, 40° are each double the previous angle: 10°, 20°=2×10°, 40°=2×20°. Maybe using double-angle identities.

I know that \(\tan 2\theta = \frac{2\tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}\). Maybe I can express \(\tan 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\). Let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\), so:

\[
\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}
\]
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2\tan 20^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \times \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \left(\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\right)^2}
\]

That seems complicated, but maybe I can compute it step by step.

First, compute \(\tan 20^\circ\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}
\]

Then, compute \(\tan 40^\circ\):

Let me denote \(u = \tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\), so:

\[
\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2u}{1 - u^2} = \frac{2 \times \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}}{1 - \left(\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\right)^2}
\]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(2 \times \frac{2t}{1 - t^2} = \frac{4t}{1 - t^2}\)

Denominator: \(1 - \left(\frac{4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}\right) = \frac{(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}\)

So, denominator becomes:

\[
\frac{1 - 2t^2 + t^4 - 4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2} = \frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{(1 - t^2)^2}
\]

Therefore, \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{\frac{4t}{1 - t^2}}{\frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{(1 - t^2)^2}} = \frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}\)

So, \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{4t(1 - t^2)}{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}\)

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but maybe I can use this to express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(t\).

Since \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\), so:

\[
\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1 - t^2}{2t}
\]
\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{4t(1 - t^2)}
\]

So, now, going back to the expression we had earlier:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Substituting in terms of \(t\):

\[
3 + t^2 + \left(\frac{1 - t^2}{2t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{4t(1 - t^2)}\right)^2
\]

Let me compute each term:

First, \(3 + t^2\).

Second term: \(\left(\frac{1 - t^2}{2t}\right)^2 = \frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{4t^2}\)

Third term: \(\left(\frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{4t(1 - t^2)}\right)^2 = \frac{(1 - 6t^2 + t^4)^2}{16t^2(1 - t^2)^2}\)

So, putting it all together:

\[
3 + t^2 + \frac{(1 - t^2)^2}{4t^2} + \frac{(1 - 6t^2 + t^4)^2}{16t^2(1 - t^2)^2}
\]

This looks really complicated, but maybe if I can find a common denominator or simplify each term, something will cancel out.

Alternatively, perhaps instead of going this route, I can use another identity or approach. Let me think.

I remember that sometimes, when dealing with sums of squares of trigonometric functions, it's helpful to use product-to-sum or sum-to-product identities, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, another idea: maybe using the identity for \(\tan^2 \theta + \cot^2 \theta\). Let me recall that:

\[
\tan^2 \theta + \cot^2 \theta = \tan^2 \theta + \frac{1}{\tan^2 \theta} = \left(\tan \theta - \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\right)^2 + 2
\]

But I don't know if that helps here because the angles are different.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for \(\tan A + \tan B + \tan C\) when A + B + C = 90° or something, but 10° + 20° + 40° = 70°, which isn't 90°, so maybe not.

Wait, another thought: maybe using the identity for \(\tan 3\theta\) as I tried earlier, but perhaps instead of trying to solve for \(t\), I can find an equation involving \(t^2\) or something.

Earlier, I had:

\[
-\sqrt{3} t^3 + 3t^2 + 3\sqrt{3} t - 1 = 0
\]

Maybe I can square both sides or manipulate it to get an equation involving \(t^2\). Alternatively, perhaps I can find expressions for \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ\) in terms of each other.

Wait, another idea: perhaps using the identity that relates \(\tan \theta\), \(\tan 2\theta\), and \(\tan 3\theta\). Since 10°, 20°, and 30° are","[30, '30']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem here: ""How many sides would there be in a convex polygon if the sum of all but one of its interior angles is 1070 degrees?"" Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2)*180 degrees. That's a key formula I need to use here. So, if the polygon has n sides, the total sum of all its interior angles is (n-2)*180.

But in this problem, it says the sum of all but one of its interior angles is 1070 degrees. So, that means one angle is missing from the total sum. Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles is 1070 degrees plus the measure of that missing angle.

Let me denote the missing angle as x. So, the total sum would be 1070 + x. But we also know that the total sum is (n-2)*180. So, we can write the equation:

1070 + x = (n - 2)*180

Now, since it's a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than 180 degrees. That's an important point because in a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180. So, the missing angle x must be less than 180 degrees.

So, x < 180.

Therefore, substituting back into the equation, we have:

1070 < (n - 2)*180 < 1070 + 180

Which simplifies to:

1070 < 180n - 360 < 1250

Let me solve these inequalities step by step.

First, let's solve the left inequality:

1070 < 180n - 360

Adding 360 to both sides:

1070 + 360 < 180n

1430 < 180n

Divide both sides by 180:

1430 / 180 < n

Let me compute that. 1430 divided by 180. Let's see, 180*7=1260, 180*8=1440. So, 1430 is between 7 and 8. Specifically, 1430 - 1260 = 170, so 170/180 = 17/18 ≈ 0.944. So, 1430/180 ≈ 7.944. So, n > approximately 7.944.

Since n must be an integer (number of sides can't be a fraction), n must be at least 8.

Now, let's solve the right inequality:

180n - 360 < 1250

Adding 360 to both sides:

180n < 1250 + 360

180n < 1610

Divide both sides by 180:

n < 1610 / 180

Calculating that, 180*8=1440, 180*9=1620. So, 1610 is just 10 less than 1620, so 1610/180 ≈ 8.944. So, n < approximately 8.944.

Since n must be an integer, n must be less than 9, so n ≤ 8.

Wait, hold on. From the left inequality, n > 7.944, so n must be at least 8. From the right inequality, n < 8.944, so n must be less than 9. Therefore, the only integer value n can take is 8.

So, n=8.

But let me verify this because sometimes when dealing with inequalities, especially with integer constraints, it's good to double-check.

If n=8, then the total sum of interior angles is (8-2)*180 = 6*180 = 1080 degrees.

But the sum given is 1070 degrees, which is 10 degrees less than 1080. So, the missing angle x is 10 degrees.

But wait, in a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than 180 degrees, which is true here because 10 degrees is less than 180. So, that seems okay.

But hold on, 10 degrees seems quite small for an interior angle in a convex polygon. Is that possible?

Well, in a convex polygon, all interior angles are less than 180, but they can be very small, depending on the shape. So, technically, yes, it's possible. For example, in a very ""sharp"" convex polygon, one angle can be very small, and the others compensate by being larger, but still less than 180.

But let me think again. If n=8, the total sum is 1080, and the sum of all but one angle is 1070, so the missing angle is 10 degrees. That seems correct.

But let me check if n could be 9. If n=9, the total sum would be (9-2)*180=7*180=1260 degrees. Then, the sum of all but one angle is 1070, so the missing angle would be 1260 - 1070 = 190 degrees. But 190 is more than 180, which would make the polygon concave, not convex. So, n cannot be 9.

Similarly, if n=7, the total sum would be (7-2)*180=5*180=900 degrees. Then, the sum of all but one angle is 1070, which is more than 900, which is impossible because you can't have a sum of angles exceeding the total sum. So, n can't be 7.

Therefore, n must be 8.

Wait, but let me think again. If n=8, the total sum is 1080, and the sum given is 1070, so the missing angle is 10 degrees. Is that acceptable? I mean, in a convex polygon, all angles must be less than 180, which is satisfied here, but is 10 degrees too small?

I think in a convex polygon, the angles can vary, but they have to be greater than 0 and less than 180. So, 10 degrees is technically allowed, even though it's a very sharp angle. So, I think n=8 is the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me think about the process again.

We have a convex polygon, so all interior angles are less than 180. The sum of all but one angle is 1070. So, the total sum is 1070 + x, where x is less than 180. So, total sum is less than 1070 + 180 = 1250.

But the total sum is also equal to (n-2)*180. So, (n-2)*180 must be less than 1250, which gives n < (1250 + 360)/180 = 1610/180 ≈8.944, so n=8.

Similarly, the total sum must be greater than 1070, so (n-2)*180 >1070, which gives n > (1070 + 360)/180=1430/180≈7.944, so n=8.

Therefore, n=8 is the only integer that satisfies both conditions.

So, yeah, I think the answer is 8 sides.

**Final Answer**
The convex polygon has \boxed{8} sides.
</think>

To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we start by using the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides, which is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\).

Given that the sum of all but one interior angle is \(1070^\circ\), we denote the missing angle as \(x\). Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ + x\). Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle must be less than \(180^\circ\), so \(x < 180^\circ\).

We set up the equation:
\[
1070 + x = (n - 2) \times 180
\]

Since \(x < 180\), we have:
\[
1070 < (n - 2) \times 180 < 1250
\]

Solving the left inequality:
\[
1070 < 180n - 360
\]
\[
1430 < 180n
\]
\[
n > \frac{1430}{180} \approx 7.944
\]

Solving the right inequality:
\[
180n - 360 < 1250
\]
\[
180n < 1610
\]
\[
n < \frac{1610}{180} \approx 8.944
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value is \(n = 8\).

To verify, if \(n = 8\), the total sum of the interior angles is:
\[
(8 - 2) \times 180 = 1080^\circ
\]
The missing angle \(x\) is:
\[

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, I start by setting up the equation based on the definition of modular inverses. This gives me \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

"First, I need to find the side length of the cube. Since the volume of a cube is given by the formula \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the side length, I can solve for \( s \) by taking the cube root of the volume. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, the side length \( s \) is 1 foot.

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) are inverse trigonometric functions. I also recall that \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(1/x)\), right? So, maybe I can rewrite the equation using that identity.

Let me write that down: \(\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) is equal to \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}(1/y)\), then substituting \(y = 1/x\), we get \(\cot^{-1}(1/x) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Yes, that seems right. So, that means the expression inside the sine function is \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x)\), which simplifies to \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\).

So, the equation becomes \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). Okay, that seems simpler. Now, I need to find \(x\) such that when I take twice the arctangent of \(x\) and then take the sine of that, I get 1/3.

I remember that there's a double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). Maybe I can use that here. Let me set \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). So, substituting back, we have:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Alright, so I need to find expressions for \(\sin(\tan^{-1}(x))\) and \(\cos(\tan^{-1}(x))\). I think I can use a right triangle to help with that.

Let me imagine a right triangle where one of the angles is \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). In such a triangle, the opposite side to angle \(\theta\) would be \(x\), and the adjacent side would be 1, since \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = x/1 = x\). Then, the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\) by the Pythagorean theorem.

So, from this triangle, \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Substituting these back into the equation:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplify the left side:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So, that gives:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):

\[
2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)
\]
\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Let me rearrange this into a standard quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

Hmm, okay, so I have a quadratic equation here. I can solve this using the quadratic formula. The quadratic is \(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\), so the coefficients are \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\).

The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). Plugging in the values:

\[
x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let me check if these are valid solutions.

First, let's consider \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is defined for all real numbers, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) is also defined for all real numbers except zero, which is fine here because \(x\) is positive. So, this solution is valid.

Next, \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let me compute the numerical value to make sure it's positive. Since \(\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414\), so \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\). Then, \(3 - 2.828 \approx 0.172\), which is positive. So, this is also a valid solution.

Wait, but I should also check if these solutions satisfy the original equation because sometimes when we square or manipulate equations, we might introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me test \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). First, compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\tan \theta = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). I remember that \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is actually \(\tan(75^\circ)\) because \(\tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{1 - 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{3})^2}{9 - 3} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{6} = \frac{12 + 6\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2 + \sqrt{3}\). Wait, that's not \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Hmm, maybe I'm mixing up some values.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute \(\sin(2\theta)\) where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Using the identity \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}\), which we already used earlier. So, plugging \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\):

Compute numerator: \(2x = 2(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}\).

Compute denominator: \(x^2 + 1 = (3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 + 1 = 9 + 12\sqrt{2} + 8 + 1 = 18 + 12\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{6 + 4\sqrt{2}}{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}\). Let me simplify this fraction.

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(2(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\)

Denominator: \(6(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\)

So, \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{2(3 + 2\sqrt{2})}{6(3 + 2\sqrt{2})} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\). Perfect, that's exactly what we needed. So, \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is a valid solution.

Now, let's test \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Again, compute \(\sin(2\theta)\) where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\).

Using the same identity: \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}\).

Compute numerator: \(2x = 2(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 6 - 4\sqrt{2}\).

Compute denominator: \(x^2 + 1 = (3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 + 1 = 9 - 12\sqrt{2} + 8 + 1 = 18 - 12\sqrt{2}\).

So, \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{6 - 4\sqrt{2}}{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}\). Let's simplify this.

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: \(2(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\)

Denominator: \(6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})\)

So, \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{2(3 - 2\sqrt{2})}{6(3 - 2\sqrt{2})} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\). Perfect again, so \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) is also a valid solution.

Therefore, both solutions satisfy the original equation, so they are both valid.

Wait, just to make sure, let me think if there's any other possible solutions. The equation \(\sin(\theta) = 1/3\) has solutions in the first and second quadrants. But in our case, the angle inside the sine function is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). Let's analyze the range of \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) has a range of \((- \pi/2, \pi/2)\), so \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) has a range of \((- \pi, \pi)\). However, since \(x\) is a real number, and in our case, both solutions are positive, so \(x > 0\), so \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is in \((0, \pi/2)\), so \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) is in \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the sine of this angle is positive, which matches our equation \(\sin(\cdot) = 1/3\), which is positive. So, we don't have to consider negative angles or anything like that.

Therefore, the only solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

I think that's all. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and both solutions check out when plugged back into the original equation. So, I'm confident these are the correct solutions.

**Final Answer**
The solutions are \(\boxed{3 + 2\sqrt{2}}\) and \(\boxed{3 - 2\sqrt{2}}\).

We start with the equation:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We use the identity \(\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\), we set \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This gives us:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x))
\]

We construct a right triangle where \(\tan(\theta) = x\), leading to:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}
\]

Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two lines given in vector form, and I need to find the distance between them. The lines are parallel, which is good because I remember that for parallel lines, the distance can be found using a specific formula. Let me try to recall how that works.

First, let me write down the equations of the lines to make sure I have them correctly.

The first line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, this line has a point \( \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and direction vector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The second line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
This line has a point \( \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \) and direction vector \( \mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \).

Wait, the problem says these lines are parallel. Let me check if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other because that's the condition for parallelism.

Looking at \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \), I notice that each component of \( \mathbf{w} \) is exactly twice that of \( \mathbf{v} \). So, \( \mathbf{w} = 2\mathbf{v} \). That confirms they are parallel. Good.

Now, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember that the distance is the length of the vector that connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line, projected onto a vector that is perpendicular to the direction of the lines. The formula for the distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{ab} \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{|\mathbf{n}|}
\]

Where \( \mathbf{ab} \) is the vector connecting points \( \mathbf{a} \) and \( \mathbf{b} \), and \( \mathbf{n} \) is a vector perpendicular to the direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \) (or \( \mathbf{w} \), since they are parallel).

But wait, actually, I think the formula is:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{v}|}
\]

Yes, that sounds right. Because the cross product \( \mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} \) gives a vector perpendicular to both, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by \( \mathbf{ab} \) and \( \mathbf{v} \). Then, dividing by \( |\mathbf{v}| \) gives the height, which is the distance between the lines.

Let me verify this. If I have two parallel lines, the minimal distance between them is the length of the vector connecting them, projected onto the direction perpendicular to the lines. So, yes, using the cross product makes sense because it inherently accounts for the perpendicular component.

So, let's compute \( \mathbf{ab} \) first. \( \mathbf{ab} \) is the vector from point \( \mathbf{a} \) to point \( \mathbf{b} \). So, subtracting \( \mathbf{a} \) from \( \mathbf{b} \):

\[
\mathbf{ab} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Okay, so \( \mathbf{ab} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \).

Next, I need to compute the cross product \( \mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} \). Let's write down \( \mathbf{v} \) again:

\( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

So, the cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} (-8)(-2) - (7)(-9) \\ (7)(2) - (-8)(-2) \\ (-8)(-9) - (7)(2) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Wait, hold on, let me recall the formula for the cross product. For two vectors \( \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix} \), the cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, applying this to \( \mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} \):

First component: \( (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) = (-14) - (-45) = -14 + 45 = 31 \)

Second component: \( (5)(2) - (-8)(-2) = 10 - 16 = -6 \)

Third component: \( (-8)(-9) - (7)(2) = 72 - 14 = 58 \)

So, \( \mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \)

Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is:

\[
|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

31 squared is 961,

(-6) squared is 36,

58 squared is 3364.

Adding them up: 961 + 36 = 997; 997 + 3364 = 4361.

So, the magnitude is \( \sqrt{4361} \). Hmm, let me see if 4361 is a perfect square. Let me try dividing by some squares:

66 squared is 4356, which is very close. 66^2 = 4356, so 4361 is 66^2 + 5, so it's not a perfect square. So, we can leave it as \( \sqrt{4361} \) for now.

Next, I need the magnitude of \( \mathbf{v} \). \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \), so:

\[
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

So, \( |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{89} \).

Therefore, the distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}}
\]

Let me compute \( \frac{4361}{89} \). Let's divide 4361 by 89.

89 times 49 is 4361 because 89*50=4450, which is 89 more than 4361, so 4450 - 89 = 4361, so 89*49=4361.

Therefore, \( \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \).

Wait, that's nice! So, the distance is 7.

Let me recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

1. Found direction vectors, confirmed they are parallel.
2. Calculated vector \( \mathbf{ab} \) from point a to point b.
3. Computed cross product \( \mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} \).
4. Found the magnitude of the cross product.
5. Divided by the magnitude of \( \mathbf{v} \) to get the distance.

All steps seem correct. The cross product calculation:

First component: 7*(-2) - 5*(-9) = -14 +45=31

Second component: 5*2 - (-8)*(-2)=10 -16=-6

Third component: (-8)*(-9) -7*2=72 -14=58

Yes, that's correct.

Magnitude squared: 31^2 + (-6)^2 +58^2=961+36+3364=4361

Divide by |v| squared: 89, so sqrt(4361/89)=sqrt(49)=7.

Yes, that all adds up. So, the distance is 7.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the two lines is \boxed{7}.

The first line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
with point \( \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \) and direction vector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The second line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
with point \( \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} \) and direction vector \( \mathbf{w} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \).

Since \( \mathbf{w} = 2\mathbf{v} \), the lines are parallel. To find the distance between them, we use the formula involving the cross product.

First, compute the vector \( \mathbf{ab} \):
\[
\mathbf{ab} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, compute the cross product \( \mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} \):
\[
\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of this cross product is:
\[
|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

The magnitude of \( \mathbf{v} \) is:
\[
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

The distance \( d \) is:
\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Thus, the distance between the two lines is \boxed{7}.","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine the number of integer coordinate points strictly inside the rectangular region, I first identify the boundaries of the rectangle. The rectangle has vertices at (5,4), (-5,4), (-5,-4), and (5,-4), which means it spans from x = -5 to x = 5 and from y = -4 to y = 4.

Since the points must be strictly inside the rectangle, the x-coordinates can range from -4 to 4, and the y-coordinates can range from -3 to 3. This is because the boundary points are excluded.

For the x-coordinates, the possible integer values are -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, giving a total of 9 options. Similarly, for the y-coordinates, the possible integer values are -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, providing 7 options.

To find the total number of interior points, I multiply the number of x-coordinate options by the number of y-coordinate options: 9 × 7 = 63.

Therefore, there are 63 integer coordinate points strictly inside the rectangular region.

To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangular region defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Boundaries:**
   - The rectangle spans from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\).
   - **Strictly interior** points must satisfy:
     \[
     -5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4
     \]

2. **Determine Integer Coordinates:**
   - **For \(x\):** The integer values are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives **9** possible values.
   - **For \(y\):** The integer values are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives **7** possible values.

3. **Calculate Total Interior Points:**
   - Multiply the number of possible \(x\) values by the number of possible \(y\) values:

     9 \times 7 = 63

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) cross (3c + a). I'm given the cross products of a, b, and c with each other: a cross b, a cross c, and b cross c. Hmm, let me write those down to keep track.

Given:
- a × b = [6, -7, 3]
- a × c = [4, 7, 2]
- b × c = [1, -7, 18]

And I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). 

Alright, cross products can be a bit tricky, but I remember that they are linear operations, so I can expand them using distributive properties. Let me recall the formula for the cross product of two vectors. If I have (u + v) × (w + x), it's equal to u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x. So, applying that here, I can expand (2b - a) × (3c + a) into four separate cross products.

Let me write that out:

(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a.

Wait, hold on, that might not be the most efficient way. Let me think again. Maybe I should factor out the scalars first. So, cross product is bilinear, meaning it's linear in both arguments. So, I can factor out the scalars 2 and 3.

So, expanding (2b - a) × (3c + a):

= 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.

But cross product is anti-commutative, right? So, a × b = - (b × a). Also, a × a = 0 because the cross product of any vector with itself is zero. So, that last term, -a × a, is just zero. So, I can ignore that.

So, simplifying:

= 2*3*(b × c) + 2*(b × a) - 3*(a × c) - 0.

Which is:

= 6*(b × c) + 2*(b × a) - 3*(a × c).

Now, let's substitute the given cross products. But wait, I have b × a and a × c. I know a × b and a × c, but b × a is just - (a × b). Similarly, a × c is given, so I can use that.

So, substituting:

= 6*(b × c) + 2*(- (a × b)) - 3*(a × c).

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, compute 6*(b × c). Given that b × c is [1, -7, 18], so multiplying by 6:

6*[1, -7, 18] = [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108].

Next, compute 2*(- (a × b)). Since a × b is [6, -7, 3], then - (a × b) is [-6, 7, -3]. Multiply by 2:

2*[-6, 7, -3] = [-12, 14, -6].

Third term, compute -3*(a × c). a × c is [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3:

-3*[4, 7, 2] = [-12, -21, -6].

Now, add all these three results together:

First term: [6, -42, 108]
Second term: [-12, 14, -6]
Third term: [-12, -21, -6]

Let me add them component-wise.

For the x-component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 -12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18.

For the y-component: -42 + 14 + (-21) = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49.

For the z-component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96.

So, putting it all together, the cross product is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any arithmetic errors.

First term: 6*(b × c) = [6, -42, 108] – that seems right.

Second term: 2*(- (a × b)) = 2*[-6,7,-3] = [-12,14,-6] – correct.

Third term: -3*(a × c) = -3*[4,7,2] = [-12,-21,-6] – correct.

Adding x-components: 6 -12 -12 = -18. Correct.

Adding y-components: -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49. Correct.

Adding z-components: 108 -6 -6 = 96. Correct.

So, the final result is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, but let me think again about the expansion step. Did I handle the signs correctly?

Original expansion:

(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.

Which is 6*(b × c) + 2*(b × a) - 3*(a × c) - 0.

But b × a is - (a × b), so 2*(b × a) = 2*(- (a × b)) = -2*(a × b). So, that term is -2*(a × b). So, substituting:

6*(b × c) - 2*(a × b) - 3*(a × c).

Wait, in my initial substitution, I had 6*(b × c) + 2*(- (a × b)) - 3*(a × c). Which is the same as 6*(b × c) - 2*(a × b) - 3*(a × c). So, that's correct.

So, plugging in the values:

6*(b × c) = [6, -42, 108]

-2*(a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]

-3*(a × c) = -3*[4,7,2] = [-12, -21, -6]

Adding these together:

[6 -12 -12, -42 +14 -21, 108 -6 -6] = [-18, -49, 96]. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the result is [-18, -49, 96].

I think that's the answer. Let me just make sure I didn't make any miscalculations in the components.

First component: 6 (from 6*(b × c)) minus 12 (from -2*(a × b)) minus 12 (from -3*(a × c)) is indeed 6 -12 -12 = -18.

Second component: -42 (from 6*(b × c)) plus 14 (from -2*(a × b)) minus 21 (from -3*(a × c)) is -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49.

Third component: 108 (from 6*(b × c)) minus 6 (from -2*(a × b)) minus 6 (from -3*(a × c)) is 108 -6 -6 = 96.

Yep, that all checks out. So, I think I did it right.

Given the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\) with the cross products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we need to compute \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

First, we expand the cross product using the distributive property:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Since \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), this term is zero. We can factor out the scalars:
\[
= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]
Using the anti-commutative property of cross products, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\), we substitute:
\[
= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]
Substituting the given cross products:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Adding these results component-wise:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"First, I need to determine the number of stamps Juan has from each country in the 1970s. From the table, I see that Brazil has 12 stamps, France has 12 stamps, Peru has 6 stamps, and Spain has 13 stamps in the 70s decade.

Next, I'll calculate the total cost for each country's stamps. Brazil and France cost 6 cents each, so 12 stamps from Brazil would cost 12 * 6 = 72 cents, and 12 stamps from France would cost 12 * 6 = 72 cents. Peru's stamps cost 4 cents each, so 6 stamps would cost 6 * 4 = 24 cents. Spain's stamps cost 5 cents each, so 13 stamps would cost 13 * 5 = 65 cents.

Adding these amounts together gives the total cost for all 70s stamps: 72 + 72 + 24 + 65 = 233 cents.

Now, I'll find the total number of 70s stamps by adding the quantities from each country: 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 stamps.

Finally, to find the average price per stamp, I'll divide the total cost by the total number of stamps: 233 / 43 ≈ 5.4186 cents. Rounding this to the nearest tenth of a cent gives an average price of 5.4 cents.

"Okay, so I have this trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. Hmm, trapezoid with two sides parallel. I remember that in a trapezoid, the two non-parallel sides are called legs, and the parallel sides are the bases. So, AD and BC are the bases here.

The problem says that AC is perpendicular to CD. So, diagonal AC is perpendicular to side CD. That must mean that triangle ACD is a right triangle because one of its angles is 90 degrees. That's useful because right triangles have some nice properties, like the Pythagorean theorem, which might come in handy later.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, the diagonal AC splits angle BAD into two equal angles. That tells me that triangle ABC might have some properties related to angle bisectors. Maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem here? I think that theorem relates the lengths of the sides of a triangle to the lengths of the segments created by the bisector.

The area of the trapezoid ABCD is given as 42. I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Since ABCD is a trapezoid, its area can be calculated using the formula: (1/2)*(sum of the two bases)*height. But I don't know the lengths of the bases or the height yet. Maybe I can express the area in terms of other variables.

Let me try to visualize the trapezoid. Let me draw it mentally: AD is parallel to BC, so let's say AD is the longer base at the bottom and BC is the shorter base at the top. Points A and D are at the ends of the lower base, and points B and C are at the ends of the upper base. Diagonal AC connects A to C, and it's perpendicular to CD. So, AC is perpendicular to CD, meaning that at point C, the angle between AC and CD is 90 degrees.

Since AC bisects angle BAD, angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle CAD is also θ. Therefore, angle BAD is 2θ.

Since AD is parallel to BC, the consecutive angles between these bases should be supplementary. So, angle ADC and angle BCD should add up to 180 degrees. But I'm not sure if that's directly useful yet.

Let me think about triangle ACD. It's a right triangle with right angle at C. So, the area of triangle ACD is (1/2)*AC*CD. If I can find the lengths of AC and CD, I can compute the area.

Alternatively, maybe I can relate the areas of the trapezoid and the triangle. The trapezoid is made up of two triangles: ABC and ACD. So, [ABCD] = [ABC] + [ACD] = 42. If I can find [ABC], then subtracting it from 42 will give me [ACD]. But I don't know [ABC] yet.

Wait, but maybe there's a better way. Since AC is an angle bisector, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem in triangle ABD or something. Wait, no, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so in triangle ABD, AC is the bisector. But actually, ABCD is a trapezoid, so maybe triangle ABD isn't necessarily a triangle unless we consider the sides.

Wait, perhaps I should assign some variables to the sides to make this more concrete. Let me denote:

Let’s let AD = a, BC = b, and the height of the trapezoid (the distance between AD and BC) be h. Then, the area of the trapezoid is (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42.

Since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is right-angled at C. So, in triangle ACD, AC is one leg, CD is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse. So, AC^2 + CD^2 = AD^2.

Also, since AC bisects angle BAD, which is 2θ, then angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. So, in triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ, and in triangle ACD, angle CAD is θ.

Wait, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem here. The angle bisector theorem states that the ratio of the lengths of the two segments created by the bisector is equal to the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.

In triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD. So, according to the angle bisector theorem, AB/AD = BC/CD.

Wait, hold on, triangle ABD? Wait, no, in the trapezoid, points are A, B, C, D. So, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, which is at vertex A. So, in triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector. But actually, in the trapezoid, AC connects A to C, which is on BC. So, maybe the angle bisector theorem applies to triangle ABD, but I need to be careful.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider triangle ABD, but in the trapezoid, BD is a diagonal, not AC. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the triangles here.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinate geometry. Let me assign coordinates to the trapezoid to make it easier.

Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and let's assume AD is horizontal for simplicity. So, point D will be at (a, 0). Then, since the trapezoid has AD || BC, point B will be somewhere above A, say at (p, h), and point C will be somewhere above D, at (q, h). So, BC is the upper base, which is parallel to AD.

Given that AC is perpendicular to CD. So, vector AC is from A(0,0) to C(q, h), so the vector is (q, h). Vector CD is from C(q, h) to D(a, 0), so the vector is (a - q, -h). Since AC is perpendicular to CD, their dot product is zero.

So, (q)(a - q) + (h)(-h) = 0.

So, q(a - q) - h^2 = 0.

Which simplifies to aq - q^2 - h^2 = 0.

So, that's one equation.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC = angle CAD.

In coordinate terms, angle between BA and AC is equal to angle between CA and AD.

Since BA is from A(0,0) to B(p, h), so vector BA is (p, h). AC is from A(0,0) to C(q, h), vector AC is (q, h). AD is from A(0,0) to D(a, 0), vector AD is (a, 0).

The angle between BA and AC is equal to the angle between AC and AD.

The angle between two vectors can be found using the dot product formula:

cos(theta) = (u . v)/(|u||v|)

So, the angle between BA and AC is equal to the angle between AC and AD.

So, cos(theta1) = (BA . AC)/(|BA||AC|) = (p*q + h*h)/(sqrt(p^2 + h^2)*sqrt(q^2 + h^2))

Similarly, cos(theta2) = (AC . AD)/(|AC||AD|) = (a*q + 0)/(sqrt(q^2 + h^2)*sqrt(a^2)) = (a q)/(sqrt(q^2 + h^2)*a) = q / sqrt(q^2 + h^2)

Since theta1 = theta2, their cosines are equal:

(p q + h^2)/(sqrt(p^2 + h^2)*sqrt(q^2 + h^2)) = q / sqrt(q^2 + h^2)

Simplify both sides:

Multiply both sides by sqrt(q^2 + h^2):

(p q + h^2)/sqrt(p^2 + h^2) = q

Multiply both sides by sqrt(p^2 + h^2):

p q + h^2 = q sqrt(p^2 + h^2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(p q + h^2)^2 = q^2 (p^2 + h^2)

Expand the left side:

p^2 q^2 + 2 p q h^2 + h^4 = q^2 p^2 + q^2 h^2

Subtract q^2 p^2 + q^2 h^2 from both sides:

2 p q h^2 + h^4 - q^2 h^2 = 0

Factor out h^2:

h^2 (2 p q + h^2 - q^2) = 0

Since h is the height, it can't be zero, so:

2 p q + h^2 - q^2 = 0

So, 2 p q = q^2 - h^2

Divide both sides by q (assuming q ≠ 0):

2 p = q - (h^2)/q

So, p = (q/2) - (h^2)/(2 q)

Okay, so that's another equation.

Earlier, from the perpendicularity of AC and CD, we had:

a q - q^2 - h^2 = 0

So, a q = q^2 + h^2

So, a = q + (h^2)/q

So, a is expressed in terms of q and h.

So, now, let's see what else we have.

We also know that ABCD is a trapezoid with AD || BC. So, the sides AB and CD are the legs.

In coordinate terms, AB is from (0,0) to (p, h), and CD is from (q, h) to (a, 0). Since AD is parallel to BC, the slope of AD is 0 (since it's horizontal), so the slope of BC must also be 0. Wait, no, BC is from (p, h) to (q, h), so it's also horizontal. So, BC is horizontal, same as AD. So, that makes sense.

So, the coordinates are:

A(0,0), D(a,0), B(p,h), C(q,h)

With AD || BC, both horizontal.

We have two equations:

1. a = q + (h^2)/q

2. p = (q/2) - (h^2)/(2 q)

Also, the area of the trapezoid is 42, which is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height = (1/2)*(a + (q - p))*h = 42

Wait, BC is the length from B(p,h) to C(q,h), so BC = q - p.

AD is from A(0,0) to D(a,0), so AD = a.

So, area is (1/2)*(a + (q - p))*h = 42

So, let's write that:

(1/2)*(a + (q - p))*h = 42

Multiply both sides by 2:

(a + q - p)*h = 84

Now, substitute a and p from equations 1 and 2:

a = q + (h^2)/q

p = (q/2) - (h^2)/(2 q)

So, a + q - p = [q + (h^2)/q] + q - [(q/2) - (h^2)/(2 q)]

Simplify:

= q + (h^2)/q + q - q/2 + (h^2)/(2 q)

Combine like terms:

= (q + q - q/2) + [(h^2)/q + (h^2)/(2 q)]

= ( (2q + 2q - q)/2 ) + ( (2 h^2 + h^2)/ (2 q) )

= (3q/2) + (3 h^2)/(2 q)

So, a + q - p = (3q)/2 + (3 h^2)/(2 q)

Therefore, (a + q - p)*h = [ (3q)/2 + (3 h^2)/(2 q) ] * h = 84

So, [ (3q)/2 + (3 h^2)/(2 q) ] * h = 84

Factor out 3/(2 q):

= (3/(2 q))*(q^2 + h^2) * h = 84

But from equation 1, a q = q^2 + h^2, so q^2 + h^2 = a q

So, substitute:

= (3/(2 q))*(a q) * h = 84

Simplify:

= (3/2)*a*h = 84

So, (3/2)*a*h = 84

Multiply both sides by 2/3:

a*h = 56

So, a*h = 56

But the area of the trapezoid is (1/2)*(a + BC)*h = 42

We have BC = q - p

From equation 2, p = (q/2) - (h^2)/(2 q)

So, BC = q - [ (q/2) - (h^2)/(2 q) ] = q - q/2 + (h^2)/(2 q) = q/2 + (h^2)/(2 q)

So, BC = (q^2 + h^2)/(2 q)

But from equation 1, a q = q^2 + h^2, so BC = a q / (2 q) = a/2

So, BC = a/2

Therefore, the area of the trapezoid is (1/2)*(a + a/2)*h = (1/2)*(3a/2)*h = (3a h)/4 = 42

But earlier, we found that a h = 56

So, (3/4)*56 = 42

Which is correct because 3/4 of 56 is 42. So, that checks out.

So, now, we need to find the area of triangle ACD.

Triangle ACD is a right triangle with legs AC and CD.

So, [ACD] = (1/2)*AC*CD

We need to find AC and CD.

From coordinates, AC is from (0,0) to (q, h), so AC = sqrt(q^2 + h^2)

CD is from (q, h) to (a, 0), so CD = sqrt( (a - q)^2 + h^2 )

But from equation 1, a q = q^2 + h^2, so a = q + (h^2)/q

So, a - q = (h^2)/q","[1, '1']",28,"[28, '28']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where four points A, B, C, and D are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. I need to find the probability that the segments AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that when dealing with points on a circle, the order in which they are placed around the circumference can affect whether the chords intersect. So maybe I should think about the different ways these four points can be arranged around the circle.

Since the points are chosen randomly, I can fix one point without loss of generality because the circle is symmetric. Let me fix point A at some position, say at angle 0 degrees. Then, the positions of points B, C, and D will be determined relative to A.

Now, the key here is to figure out the conditions under which chords AB and CD intersect. I remember that two chords intersect if and only if the four points are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, if the points are in the order A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C when moving around the circle. If they are in a non-alternating order, like A, B, C, D, then the chords won't intersect.

So, to rephrase, for chords AB and CD to intersect, the points must alternate between the two chords. That is, one chord's endpoints are separated by the other chord's endpoints. So, if I fix point A, then the other three points B, C, D can be arranged in different orders around the circle.

Since the points are chosen independently and uniformly, the probability should be the same regardless of where A is placed. So, fixing A doesn't affect the generality.

Now, let's think about the possible arrangements of the other three points. There are 3! = 6 possible orderings of points B, C, D around the circle. Each ordering is equally likely because the points are chosen randomly.

Out of these 6 orderings, how many result in the chords AB and CD intersecting? Let's list them:

1. A, B, C, D: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
2. A, B, D, C: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
3. A, C, B, D: Chords AB and CD intersect.
4. A, C, D, B: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.
5. A, D, B, C: Chords AB and CD intersect.
6. A, D, C, B: Chords AB and CD do not intersect.

Wait, so out of the 6 possible orderings, only two result in intersecting chords. So, the probability should be 2/6, which simplifies to 1/3.

But hold on, is this correct? Let me double-check. Maybe I missed something.

Alternatively, another approach is to consider that once point A is fixed, the positions of B, C, D are random. The probability that chords AB and CD intersect can be determined by considering the relative positions of B, C, D.

After fixing A, the circle is effectively a line from A to A, and the other three points are placed randomly on this line. The chords AB and CD will intersect if and only if C and D are on different sides of AB. Wait, no, that might not be the right way to think about it.

Wait, actually, on a circle, the concept of sides isn't linear. Instead, the chords intersect if the points are interleaved. So, if we fix A, then the order of B, C, D around the circle determines whether AB and CD cross.

Another way to think about it is that for two chords to intersect, the four points must form a quadrilateral where the chords are the two diagonals. So, in a convex quadrilateral, the two diagonals intersect. So, the probability that AB and CD are diagonals of the quadrilateral formed by A, B, C, D.

But how many quadrilaterals have AB and CD as diagonals? Well, for four points on a circle, any four points form a convex quadrilateral, and in such a quadrilateral, there are two diagonals. So, the number of ways AB and CD can be diagonals is equal to the number of quadrilaterals where AB and CD are diagonals.

Wait, maybe I'm complicating it. Let me think again.

If I fix point A, then the positions of B, C, D can be arranged in 3! = 6 ways around the circle. As I listed before, only two of these arrangements result in intersecting chords. So, the probability is 2/6 = 1/3.

But I also remember that sometimes in probability problems involving circles, the probability is 1/3 for such intersection. So, maybe that's the answer.

Wait, but let me think differently. Maybe using combinatorics. The total number of ways to choose four points on a circle is C(n,4) if there are n points, but since the points are continuous, it's a bit different. But in terms of ordering, it's similar to arranging four points on a circle, which can be done in (4-1)! = 6 ways, but since the circle has rotational symmetry, fixing one point reduces it to 3! = 6 orderings.

Wait, no, actually, for four distinct points on a circle, the number of distinct orderings is (4-1)! = 6, but since we fix one point, it's 3! = 6. So, each ordering is equally likely.

In each ordering, the chords AB and CD will intersect only if the points alternate. So, for four points, the number of ways they can alternate is 2: either A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C. So, 2 out of 6, which is 1/3.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that once A is fixed, the probability that B is next to A is 1/3, but that might not directly help.

Wait, perhaps using the concept of circular permutations. The number of ways to arrange four points on a circle is (4-1)! = 6. For each arrangement, we can check if AB and CD intersect.

But actually, in circular permutations, fixing one point, say A, the number of linear arrangements of the other three points is 3! = 6. Each of these corresponds to a unique circular arrangement.

In these 6 arrangements, how many have AB and CD intersecting? As I listed before, two of them: A, C, B, D and A, D, B, C. So, 2 out of 6, which is 1/3.

Alternatively, another approach: for four points on a circle, the probability that two specific chords intersect is equal to the number of intersecting configurations divided by the total number of configurations.

The total number of ways to pair four points into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each pairing is equally likely if the points are randomly chosen.

Wait, hold on, that might be a different way to look at it. If we consider all possible pairings, there are three possible ways to pair four points: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each of these pairings is equally likely, right?

But in our problem, we are specifically looking at the pairing AB and CD. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that, among all possible pairings, the specific pairing AB-CD is an intersecting one.

But wait, actually, in the problem, the points are chosen randomly, so the pairing is fixed as AB and CD. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is the same as the probability that, given four random points, the specific pairing AB and CD forms intersecting chords.

So, perhaps the number of intersecting configurations over the total configurations.

But I think the earlier approach is correct: fixing A, the other three points can be arranged in 6 ways, and in 2 of those, AB and CD intersect. So, probability is 1/3.

But wait, another thought: when choosing four points randomly on a circle, the probability that two specific chords intersect is 1/3. I think that's a known result.

Alternatively, let's think about the probability step by step.

After fixing point A, the position of point B can be anywhere on the circle. Then, points C and D are placed randomly. The chords AB and CD will intersect if C and D are on different arcs determined by AB.

Wait, that might be another way to think about it. So, once A and B are fixed, the circle is divided into two arcs: the minor arc AB and the major arc AB. For chords AB and CD to intersect, points C and D must lie on different arcs.

But wait, is that correct? Actually, no. Because even if both C and D are on the same arc, the chord CD might still intersect AB if it's long enough. Wait, no, actually, on a circle, two chords AB and CD intersect if and only if the four points are interleaved, meaning that when you go around the circle, you encounter A, then C, then B, then D, or A, D, B, C.

So, in terms of arcs, if C and D are on different arcs determined by AB, then CD will cross AB. But actually, no, because if both C and D are on the same arc, CD won't cross AB. If they are on different arcs, CD will cross AB.

Wait, so maybe the probability is equal to the probability that C and D are on different arcs determined by AB.

Since after fixing A and B, the circle is divided into two arcs. The probability that C is on one arc and D is on the other is equal to 2 * (length of arc AB / circumference) * (length of the other arc / circumference). But since the points are chosen uniformly, the probability that C is on one arc and D on the other is 2 * (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/2.

Wait, that can't be right because earlier reasoning suggested 1/3.

Hmm, now I'm confused. Which one is correct?

Wait, perhaps I need to clarify. If I fix points A and B, then the circle is divided into two arcs. The probability that C and D are on different arcs is 2 * (arc length / circumference) * (arc length / circumference). But since the arcs are determined by A and B, which are random, the expected value might be different.

Wait, actually, the length of the arc AB is random. So, the probability that C and D are on different arcs depends on the length of arc AB.

But since A and B are randomly chosen, the distribution of arc AB is uniform over the circle. So, the expected probability that C and D are on different arcs is the expected value of 2 * (arc AB / circumference) * (1 - arc AB / circumference).

Let me denote the circumference as 1 for simplicity. Then, the length of arc AB is a random variable X uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. The probability that C and D are on different arcs is 2 * X * (1 - X). So, the expected probability is the integral from 0 to 1 of 2 * X * (1 - X) dx.

Calculating that integral:

Integral of 2X(1 - X) dx from 0 to 1
= 2 * Integral (X - X^2) dx from 0 to 1
= 2 * [ (1/2)X^2 - (1/3)X^3 ] from 0 to 1
= 2 * [ (1/2 - 1/3) - 0 ]
= 2 * (1/6)
= 1/3

So, the expected probability is 1/3. Therefore, the probability that chords AB and CD intersect is 1/3.

Wait, so that matches my earlier result. So, both methods give 1/3. So, that must be the correct answer.

But just to make sure, let me think of another approach. Maybe using combinatorics.

There are four points on a circle. The number of ways to pair them into two chords is 3: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each pairing is equally likely if the points are randomly placed. So, the probability that AB and CD are the specific pairing is 1/3. But wait, in our problem, we are not choosing the pairing randomly; we are fixing AB and CD as the chords. So, the probability that AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that, among all possible pairings, the specific pairing AB-CD is an intersecting one.

But in reality, for four points on a circle, exactly one of the three pairings results in intersecting chords. So, if we fix AB and CD, the probability that they intersect is 1/3 because only one of the three possible pairings intersect.

Wait, that seems conflicting with the earlier result. Wait, no, actually, for four points on a circle, the number of intersecting pairings is one out of the three possible pairings. So, if we fix AB and CD, the probability that they intersect is 1/3.

Yes, that makes sense. So, that's another way to see it.

Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability that segments $AB$ and $CD$ intersect is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.
</think>

To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can consider the following reasoning:

1. **Fixing a Point**: Without loss of generality, we can fix point \(A\) at a specific position on the circle. The positions of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) will then be determined relative to \(A\).

2. **Orderings of Points**: The points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) different orders around the circle. Each ordering is equally likely because the points are chosen randomly.

3. **Intersecting Chords Condition**: For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must alternate around the circle. This means the order of the points must be such that one chord's endpoints are separated by the other chord's endpoints. Specifically, the valid alternating orders are \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\).

4. **Counting Valid Orderings**: Out of the 6 possible orderings of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), only 2 result in intersecting chords. These are the orderings where the points alternate between the two chords.

5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the number of valid orderings divided by the total number of orderings. This gives us \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

6. **Alternative Approach**: Considering the problem in terms of pairings, there are three possible ways to pair four points into two chords: \(AB-CD\), \(AC-BD\","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem with two circles, both centered at point D. The smaller circle has a radius of 1, and the larger one has a radius of 2. The shaded area is given as 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of angle ADC in degrees.

First, let me visualize the diagram. There are two concentric circles (since they share the same center D). The smaller circle has radius 1, and the larger one has radius 2. Points A and C are on the larger circle, and there's a shaded region which seems to be a sort of lens shape or maybe a segment between the two circles.

The Asymptote code shows that the shaded region is created by two arcs: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. It also mentions angle ADC, which is the angle at the center D between points A and C. So, angle ADC is the central angle that defines the sector in both circles.

Given that the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle, I can write that as:

Shaded Area = (5/12) * Area of Larger Circle

The area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. So, the shaded area is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

Now, I need to figure out what the shaded area represents. Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like the shaded region is the area between two circular segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. So, the shaded area is the area of the sector in the larger circle minus the area of the sector in the smaller circle, but also considering the triangles involved.

Wait, actually, in the Asymptote code, it's drawing two regions: one is a gray region that seems to be the area between the two arcs, and another gray region which is a segment. Hmm, maybe it's the union of two regions? Or perhaps it's the area between the two sectors.

Wait, let me think again. The Asymptote code draws two paths: one is an arc from the smaller circle and another from the larger circle, and then fills the regions between them. So, the shaded area is the area between the two sectors, which is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector.

But the problem says the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So, Shaded Area = (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

So, if I denote θ as the measure of angle ADC in radians, then the area of the sector in the larger circle is (1/2)*r²*θ = (1/2)*(2)^2*θ = 2θ. Similarly, the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (1/2)*(1)^2*θ = (1/2)θ.

Therefore, the area between the two sectors (the shaded region) would be 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ.

But wait, the shaded area is given as (5/3)π. So, setting up the equation:

(3/2)θ = (5/3)π

Solving for θ:

θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π radians.

But the question asks for the measure in degrees. So, converting radians to degrees:

θ = (10/9)π * (180/π) = (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is not just the difference between the two sectors but also includes some triangular areas? Let me think.

Looking back at the Asymptote code, it mentions two regions: one is a path from A to a/2, then along the inner arc to c/2, then to C, then along the outer arc back to A. The other region is an arc from a/2 to c/2, then to D, then back to a/2.

Hmm, so the shaded area is actually two regions: one is the area between the two arcs (the annular sector), and the other is a smaller segment inside the smaller circle.

Wait, maybe I need to calculate both shaded regions.

First, the larger shaded region is the area between the two sectors, which is 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ.

The second shaded region is the area inside the smaller circle but outside the triangle ADC. So, that would be the area of the smaller sector minus the area of triangle ADC.

The area of the smaller sector is (1/2)*1²*θ = (1/2)θ.

The area of triangle ADC: since it's a triangle with two sides of length 1 (from D to A and D to C) and the included angle θ. The area is (1/2)*ab*sinθ = (1/2)*1*1*sinθ = (1/2)sinθ.

So, the area of the second shaded region is (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ.

Therefore, the total shaded area is the sum of the two regions:

(3/2)θ + [(1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ] = (3/2 + 1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ = 2θ - (1/2)sinθ.

This total shaded area is equal to (5/3)π.

So, 2θ - (1/2)sinθ = (5/3)π.

Hmm, this is a bit more complicated because now we have an equation involving both θ and sinθ. It might not be straightforward to solve algebraically. Maybe I need to use some approximation or think if there's another way.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle is given as 100 degrees, but in the problem, it's asking for the measure of angle ADC. So, maybe the initial assumption that the shaded area is just the annular sector is incorrect, and the total shaded area is actually the sum of two regions: the annular sector and the smaller segment.

But in that case, the equation is 2θ - (1/2)sinθ = (5/3)π.

This seems tricky because it's a transcendental equation. Maybe I can approximate θ.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in interpreting the shaded regions. Let me look again.

The Asymptote code says:

- The first region is (a--a/2)..inner..(c/2--c)..outer..cycle;

So, this is a path from A to a/2 (midpoint of A and D?), then along the inner arc (smaller circle) to c/2, then to C, then along the outer arc back to A.

Wait, actually, a/2 and c/2 are points on the smaller circle because the smaller circle has radius 1, and the larger has radius 2. So, a is a point on the larger circle, so a/2 would be a point on the smaller circle in the same direction.

Similarly, c is a point on the larger circle, so c/2 is the midpoint towards D.

So, the first shaded region is the area between the two arcs from a/2 to c/2, but on the smaller circle, and then from c/2 to c on the larger circle, and back to a.

Wait, maybe it's a quadrilateral-like shape but with curved sides.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the union of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle.

Wait, maybe it's better to think of the shaded area as the area between the two sectors, which is 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ, but also including the area of the triangle in the smaller circle.

Wait, no, the Asymptote code is filling two regions: one is the area between the two arcs, and the other is the area inside the smaller circle but outside the triangle.

So, the total shaded area is the area between the two sectors plus the area of the smaller segment.

Wait, but the area between the two sectors is 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ, and the smaller segment is (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ.

So, total shaded area is (3/2)θ + (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ = 2θ - (1/2)sinθ.

So, 2θ - (1/2)sinθ = (5/3)π.

This is the equation we have.

Now, we need to solve for θ in radians.

This equation is 2θ - (1/2)sinθ = (5/3)π.

Let me compute the right-hand side: (5/3)π ≈ (5/3)*3.1416 ≈ 5.236.

So, 2θ - 0.5 sinθ ≈ 5.236.

We can try to approximate θ.

Let me assume θ is in radians, and let's try θ = 2 radians.

Compute 2*2 - 0.5*sin(2) ≈ 4 - 0.5*0.909 ≈ 4 - 0.4545 ≈ 3.5455, which is less than 5.236.

Try θ = 3 radians.

2*3 - 0.5*sin(3) ≈ 6 - 0.5*(-0.1411) ≈ 6 + 0.0705 ≈ 6.0705, which is more than 5.236.

So, θ is between 2 and 3 radians.

Let me try θ = 2.5 radians.

2*2.5 - 0.5*sin(2.5) ≈ 5 - 0.5*0.5985 ≈ 5 - 0.299 ≈ 4.701, still less than 5.236.

Next, θ = 2.7 radians.

2*2.7 - 0.5*sin(2.7) ≈ 5.4 - 0.5*0.4274 ≈ 5.4 - 0.2137 ≈ 5.1863, still less than 5.236.

θ = 2.75 radians.

2*2.75 - 0.5*sin(2.75) ≈ 5.5 - 0.5*0.3817 ≈ 5.5 - 0.1908 ≈ 5.3092, which is more than 5.236.

So, θ is between 2.7 and 2.75 radians.

Let me try θ = 2.72 radians.

2*2.72 = 5.44

sin(2.72) ≈ sin(2.72) ≈ 0.4034

So, 5.44 - 0.5*0.4034 ≈ 5.44 - 0.2017 ≈ 5.2383, which is very close to 5.236.

So, θ ≈ 2.72 radians.

Convert 2.72 radians to degrees: 2.72 * (180/π) ≈ 2.72 * 57.2958 ≈ 155.7 degrees.

Wait, but the Asymptote code initially sets angle ADC to 100 degrees, but according to this, it's approximately 155.7 degrees. Hmm, that seems conflicting.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in interpreting the shaded area.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is only the area between the two sectors, without the smaller segment. Let me check.

If I consider only the annular sector, which is 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ, and set that equal to (5/3)π.

So, (3/2)θ = (5/3)π

θ = (5/3)π * (2/3) = (10/9)π ≈ 3.497 radians ≈ 200 degrees.

But earlier, when I considered the total shaded area as 2θ - (1/2)sinθ, I got θ ≈ 2.72 radians ≈ 155.7 degrees.

But the Asymptote code seems to have two shaded regions: one is the area between the two arcs, and the other is a segment inside the smaller circle.

Wait, maybe the total shaded area is the sum of the annular sector and the smaller segment.

So, annular sector area: 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ

Smaller segment area: (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ

Total shaded area: (3/2)θ + (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ = 2θ - (1/2)sinθ

Which is what I had before.

So, 2θ - (1/2)sinθ = (5/3)π ≈ 5.236

So, solving for θ, we get approximately 2.72 radians, which is about 155.7 degrees.

But the Asymptote code initially sets angle ADC to 100 degrees, but in the problem, it's asking for the measure of angle ADC, so maybe 100 degrees is just a placeholder.

Wait, perhaps I need to think differently. Maybe the shaded area is the union of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle.

Wait, the Asymptote code draws two regions:

1. region1: from A to a/2, along the inner arc to c/2, then to C, along the outer arc back to A.

2. region2: from a/2 along the inner arc to c/2, then to D, then back to a/2.

So, region1 is the area between the two arcs from a/2 to c/2, and region2 is the segment inside the smaller circle.

So, region1 is the area between the two sectors, which is 2θ - (1/2)θ = (3/2)θ

Region2 is the area of the smaller segment, which is (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ

So, total shaded area is (3/2)θ + (1/2)θ - (1/2)sinθ = 2θ -","[2, '2']",120,"[120, '120']",True
"First, I need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is \( V = \pi r^2 h \). Given that the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm, the volume of the beaker is \( \pi \times 3^2 \times 8 = 72\pi \) cubic centimeters.

To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker.**
2. **Calculate the volume of the spherical tank.**

"Okay, so I have this problem to evaluate the expression:

\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)
\]

Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that involve the sine of sums and differences. Maybe I can use those to simplify the expression. Let me recall the sine addition and subtraction formulas:

\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
\]

So, if I let \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \), then the expression becomes:

\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B)
\]

Which, using the identities, would be:

\[
[\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B] \cdot [\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B]
\]

Wait, that looks like the product of a sum and difference, which is a difference of squares. So, this simplifies to:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

Okay, so that's a bit simpler. Now, I need to compute this expression. Let me write that down:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2
\]

But I know that \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \) and \( B = \arcsin 0.5 \). So, \( \sin A = 0.4 \) and \( \sin B = 0.5 \). I need to find \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \) to plug into the equation.

I remember that \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} \) for \( \theta \) in the range where cosine is positive. Since \( \arcsin \) returns values between \( -\pi/2 \) and \( \pi/2 \), cosine will be positive. So, let's compute \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \).

First, \( \cos A = \sqrt{1 - (0.4)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} \). Let me calculate that. \( \sqrt{0.84} \) is approximately 0.9165, but maybe I can keep it exact for now. So, \( \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{84/100} = \sqrt{21/25} = \sqrt{21}/5 \). Wait, is that right? Let me check:

\( 21/25 = 0.84 \), yes, so \( \sqrt{21}/5 \) is correct. So, \( \cos A = \sqrt{21}/5 \).

Similarly, \( \cos B = \sqrt{1 - (0.5)^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} \). That's \( \sqrt{3}/2 \), since \( \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{3/4} = \sqrt{3}/2 \). So, \( \cos B = \sqrt{3}/2 \).

Alright, so now I can substitute these back into the expression:

\[
(\sin A \cos B)^2 - (\cos A \sin B)^2 = (0.4 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2)^2 - (\sqrt{21}/5 \cdot 0.5)^2
\]

Let me compute each term separately.

First term: \( (0.4 \cdot \sqrt{3}/2)^2 \)

Compute inside the square first:

\( 0.4 \times \sqrt{3}/2 = (0.4/2) \times \sqrt{3} = 0.2 \times \sqrt{3} \)

So, squaring that: \( (0.2 \sqrt{3})^2 = (0.2)^2 \times (\sqrt{3})^2 = 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12 \)

Second term: \( (\sqrt{21}/5 \cdot 0.5)^2 \)

Compute inside the square first:

\( \sqrt{21}/5 \times 0.5 = (\sqrt{21}/5) \times (1/2) = \sqrt{21}/10 \)

Squaring that: \( (\sqrt{21}/10)^2 = (21)/100 = 0.21 \)

So, putting it all together:

\[
0.12 - 0.21 = -0.09
\]

Wait, that gives me a negative number. Is that possible? Let me double-check my steps because I might have made a mistake.

First, let's verify the computation of \( \cos A \) and \( \cos B \):

- \( \cos A = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} \approx 0.9165 \). But I expressed it as \( \sqrt{21}/5 \). Let me check:

\( (\sqrt{21}/5)^2 = 21/25 = 0.84 \). Yes, that's correct.

- \( \cos B = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{3}/2 \approx 0.8660 \). Correct.

Then, computing the first term:

\( 0.4 \times \sqrt{3}/2 = 0.2 \sqrt{3} \). Squared is \( 0.04 \times 3 = 0.12 \). Correct.

Second term:

\( \sqrt{21}/5 \times 0.5 = \sqrt{21}/10 \). Squared is \( 21/100 = 0.21 \). Correct.

So, 0.12 - 0.21 is indeed -0.09. Hmm, but sine functions can give negative results, so maybe that's okay. But let me think again about the original expression.

Wait, the original expression is the product of two sine terms. So, it's possible for the product to be negative if one of the sine terms is negative. Let me check the angles involved.

\( \arcsin 0.4 \) is an angle in the first quadrant, since 0.4 is positive. Similarly, \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is also in the first quadrant. So, both \( A \) and \( B \) are between 0 and \( \pi/2 \).

Therefore, \( A + B \) is between 0 and \( \pi \), and \( A - B \) is between \( -\pi/2 \) and \( \pi/2 \). So, \( \sin(A + B) \) is positive because \( A + B \) is in the first or second quadrant, and \( \sin(A - B) \) could be positive or negative depending on whether \( A > B \) or not.

Wait, let's compute \( A \) and \( B \) numerically to see.

Compute \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \). Let me approximate that. Since \( \sin(\pi/6) = 0.5 \), and 0.4 is less than 0.5, so \( A \) is less than \( \pi/6 \) (which is about 0.5236 radians). Let me compute it more accurately.

Using a calculator, \( \arcsin 0.4 \) is approximately 0.4115 radians.

Similarly, \( \arcsin 0.5 \) is \( \pi/6 \) which is approximately 0.5236 radians.

So, \( A \approx 0.4115 \), \( B \approx 0.5236 \). Therefore, \( A - B \approx -0.1121 \) radians, which is negative. So, \( \sin(A - B) \) is negative because it's in the fourth quadrant. Therefore, the product \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \) is positive times negative, which is negative. So, getting a negative result makes sense.

But let me see if there's another way to compute this expression without going through all these steps, maybe using another identity.

Wait, I remember that \( \sin C \cdot \sin D \) can be expressed using the identity:

\[
\sin C \sin D = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(C - D) - \cos(C + D)]
\]

But in this case, our expression is \( \sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(A - B) \). Let me see if I can apply this identity.

Let me set \( C = A + B \) and \( D = A - B \). Then,

\[
\sin C \sin D = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(C - D) - \cos(C + D)]
\]

Compute \( C - D = (A + B) - (A - B) = 2B \)

Compute \( C + D = (A + B) + (A - B) = 2A \)

So, substituting back:

\[
\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2B) - \cos(2A)]
\]

Hmm, that might be a simpler way to compute it. Let me try that.

So, I need to compute \( \cos(2A) \) and \( \cos(2B) \).

I know that \( \cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta \). So, let's compute \( \cos(2A) \) and \( \cos(2B) \).

First, \( \cos(2A) = 1 - 2\sin^2 A = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68 \)

Similarly, \( \cos(2B) = 1 - 2\sin^2 B = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5 \)

So, plugging back into the identity:

\[
\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [0.5 - 0.68] = \frac{1}{2} (-0.18) = -0.09
\]

So, same result as before. So, that confirms that the answer is indeed -0.09.

But wait, let me think again. Is there another way to compute this? Maybe using the original expression with the sine of sum and difference.

Alternatively, perhaps using the identity for \( \sin(A + B)\sin(A - B) \). Wait, I think that's the same as the identity I used earlier, which gave me the same result.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute \( A + B \) and \( A - B \) numerically and then compute the sine of each and multiply.

Let me try that approach.

First, compute \( A = \arcsin 0.4 \approx 0.4115 \) radians.

Compute \( B = \arcsin 0.5 = \pi/6 \approx 0.5236 \) radians.

So, \( A + B \approx 0.4115 + 0.5236 = 0.9351 \) radians.

Compute \( \sin(A + B) = \sin(0.9351) \). Let me compute that.

Using a calculator, \( \sin(0.9351) \approx 0.8075 \).

Similarly, \( A - B \approx 0.4115 - 0.5236 = -0.1121 \) radians.

Compute \( \sin(A - B) = \sin(-0.1121) = -\sin(0.1121) \approx -0.1120 \).

So, the product is \( 0.8075 \times (-0.1120) \approx -0.0904 \).

Which is approximately -0.09, which matches our previous result.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -0.09.

But let me see if I can express this exactly without approximating.

Earlier, I had:

\[
\sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2B) - \cos(2A)] = \frac{1}{2} [0.5 - 0.68] = \frac{1}{2} (-0.18) = -0.09
\]

But 0.5 is 1/2, and 0.68 is 17/25. Wait, 0.68 is 17/25? Let me check:

17 divided by 25 is 0.68, yes. So, 0.5 is 1/2, which is 12.5/25, and 0.68 is 17/25.

So, \( \cos(2B) - \cos(2A) = 1/2 - 17/25 \). Let me compute that exactly.

Convert to a common denominator, which is 50.

1/2 = 25/50, 17/25 = 34/50.

So, 25/50 - 34/50 = -9/50.

Therefore, \( \sin(A + B) \sin(A - B) = \frac{1}{2} (-9/50) = -9/100 = -0.09 \).

So, that's exact. So, the exact value is -9/100, which is -0.09.

Therefore, the answer is","[-0.0900000000000000, '-0.09']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",False

\mu = \frac{x + (x + 1) + (x + 2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1
\]

**Step 2: Use the Second Condition**

According to the second condition:
\[
\frac{x(x + 1)(x + 2)}{\mu} = 24
\]
Substitute \(\mu = x + 1\):
\[
\frac{x(x + 1)(x + 2)}{x + 1} = 24
\]
Simplify:
\[
x(x + 2) = 24
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0
\]

**Step 3: Solve the Quadratic Equation**

\[
x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0
\]
Using the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
Where \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -24\):
\[
x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 96}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-12}{2} = -6
\]

**Step 4: Determine the Largest Integer**

- If \(x = 4\), the integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The largest is \(6\).
- If \(x = -6\), the integers are \(-6\), \(-5\), and \(-4\). The largest is \(-4\).

However, since the product of three negative integers is negative, and the given product is positive (120), we discard the negative solution.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), I start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives me \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3\), which simplifies to \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\).

Next, I rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation by subtracting 4096 from both sides, resulting in \(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\).

To solve this quadratic equation, I use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Plugging in these values, I calculate the discriminant as \(16 + 16368 = 16384\), which is a perfect square.

Taking the square root of the discriminant gives me 128. Substituting back into the quadratic formula, I find the solutions \(x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = 66\) and \(x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = -62\).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to simplify the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), and cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a trigonometric identity that can help me simplify this.

First, I remember that products of cosines can sometimes be simplified using product-to-sum formulas, but with four terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that there are formulas for multiple angles or maybe something related to roots of unity. Let me think about that.

Wait, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15... I notice that each angle is double the previous one. 2π/15, then 4π/15 (which is 2*(2π/15)), then 8π/15 (which is 2*(4π/15)), and 16π/15 (which is 2*(8π/15)). So, each term is a doubling of the angle. That seems like a geometric progression in the angles. Maybe I can use some identity related to multiple angles or perhaps something with complex numbers.

I remember that the product of cosines with angles in geometric progression can sometimes be expressed in terms of sine functions. There's a formula that says:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k x) = sin(2^n x) / (2^n sin x)

But wait, does that apply here? Let me check. If I set x = 2π/15, then 2x = 4π/15, 4x = 8π/15, 8x = 16π/15, and 16x = 32π/15. But 32π/15 is more than 2π, so maybe I need to adjust it.

Wait, 32π/15 is equal to 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) is the same as sin(2π/15) because sine has a period of 2π. So, maybe I can use that identity here.

Let me write it out:

Product_{k=0}^{3} cos(2^k x) = sin(2^4 x) / (2^4 sin x)

So, in this case, x = 2π/15, so 2^4 x = 16x = 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product becomes sin(2π/15) / (16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, does that mean the product of these four cosines is 1/16? Let me verify.

But hold on, the formula I used is for the product of cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * cos(8x) = sin(16x)/(16 sin x). So, in this case, x is 2π/15, so 16x is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But wait, let me check if the formula is correct. I think the formula is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k x) = sin(2^n x) / (2^n sin x)

Yes, that seems right. So, for n=4, it's sin(16x)/(16 sin x). So, in this case, x=2π/15, so 16x=32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15))=1/16.

But wait, let me compute the product numerically to check if that's correct. Let me compute each cosine term:

cos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135

cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691

cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045

cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781

Multiplying them together: 0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118; 0.6118 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639; -0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625.

Hmm, 0.0625 is 1/16. So, that seems to confirm it. So, the product is indeed 1/16.

Wait, but in my calculation, I got a positive number, but when I multiplied the cosines, two of them were negative, so negative times negative is positive. So, the product is positive 1/16.

But let me think again. The formula gives sin(16x)/(16 sin x). So, sin(16x) is sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). So, sin(2π/15) is positive because 2π/15 is in the first quadrant. So, sin(2π/15) is positive, and sin x is also positive because x=2π/15 is in the first quadrant. So, the ratio is positive, which matches the numerical result.

Therefore, the product is indeed 1/16.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the formula. The formula is for the product of cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}x) = sin(2^n x)/(2^n sin x). So, in this case, n=4, so 2^4 x=16x=32π/15. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is using complex numbers. The product of cosines can be related to the real parts of complex exponentials. But that might be more complicated.

Alternatively, I can use the identity for multiple angles. For example, using the identity that relates the product of cosines to a sum, but with four terms, that might be tedious.

Alternatively, I can use the identity for sin(2^n x) in terms of the product of cosines. Let me recall that:

sin(2x) = 2 sin x cos x

sin(4x) = 2 sin(2x) cos(2x) = 4 sin x cos x cos(2x)

sin(8x) = 2 sin(4x) cos(4x) = 8 sin x cos x cos(2x) cos(4x)

sin(16x) = 2 sin(8x) cos(8x) = 16 sin x cos x cos(2x) cos(4x) cos(8x)

So, sin(16x) = 16 sin x cos x cos(2x) cos(4x) cos(8x)

Therefore, cos x cos(2x) cos(4x) cos(8x) = sin(16x)/(16 sin x)

Which is exactly the formula I used earlier. So, that's correct.

Therefore, in this problem, x=2π/15, so 16x=32π/15=2π + 2π/15, so sin(16x)=sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15))=1/16.

So, the simplified product is 1/16.

Wait, but let me check if 16x is indeed 32π/15. 16*(2π/15)=32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so yes, sin(32π/15)=sin(2π/15). So, that's correct.

Therefore, the product is 1/16.

But just to be thorough, let me compute the product numerically again:

cos(2π/15) ≈ cos(24°) ≈ 0.9135

cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(48°) ≈ 0.6691

cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(96°) ≈ -0.1045

cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(192°) ≈ -0.9781

Multiplying them together:

0.9135 * 0.6691 ≈ 0.6118

0.6118 * (-0.1045) ≈ -0.0639

-0.0639 * (-0.9781) ≈ 0.0625

Which is 1/16, since 1/16=0.0625. So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the simplified product is 1/16.

To simplify the product \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we can use the identity for the product of cosines with angles in geometric progression:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos(2^k x) = \frac{\sin(2^n x)}{2^n \sin x}
\]

Here, we set \(x = \frac{2\pi}{15}\) and \(n = 4\). Thus, we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin(16 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{15})}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}
\]

Calculating the angle inside the sine function:

\[
16 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{15} = \frac{32\pi}{15} = 2\pi + \frac{2\pi}{15}

Since \(\sin(2\pi + \theta) = \sin(\theta)\), we have:

\[
\sin \left( \frac{32\pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)

Thus, the product simplifies to:

\[
\frac{\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{1}{16}

"Okay, so I have this problem about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, and there's an altitude AM which is 11 units long. There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the altitude AM from A to BC will bisect BC. So, M is the midpoint of BC. The length of AM is 11, so the height of the triangle is 11. Point D is somewhere on AM, 10 units away from A, which means it's 1 unit away from M because AM is 11. So, D is very close to M.

Given that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.

Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote each of these angles as (180° - θ)/2. But maybe working in radians would be better, but I think degrees are okay for now.

I think I can use trigonometric relationships here. Maybe the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles ABD, ADC, or BDC.

Wait, let me think about triangle BDC. In triangle BDC, angle at D is 3θ, and sides BD and CD can be related to the sides of triangle ABC.

But I don't know BD or CD yet. Maybe I can express BD and CD in terms of the sides of ABC.

Let me denote the length of AB and AC as x. Since ABC is isosceles, AB = AC = x. The base BC can be found using the Pythagorean theorem because AM is the altitude. So, BM = MC = (BC)/2. Let me denote BM as y, so BC = 2y.

Then, in triangle ABM, which is right-angled at M, we have AB² = AM² + BM², so x² = 11² + y², which is x² = 121 + y².

So, if I can find y, I can find x, and then the perimeter will be 2x + 2y.

Wait, no, the perimeter is AB + AC + BC, which is x + x + 2y, so 2x + 2y. So, I need to find x and y.

But how?

Given that angle BDC = 3θ, and θ is angle BAC. Maybe I can express angle BDC in terms of θ and relate it to the sides.

Alternatively, maybe using coordinate geometry. Let me place point A at (0,11), M at (0,0), so B is at (-y,0) and C is at (y,0). Then, point D is on AM, which is the y-axis, 10 units below A, so D is at (0,1).

So, coordinates:

A: (0,11)

D: (0,1)

B: (-y,0)

C: (y,0)

M: (0,0)

So, now, angle BDC is the angle at D between points B and C. So, points B(-y,0), D(0,1), and C(y,0). So, angle BDC is the angle at D between lines DB and DC.

I can compute the slopes of DB and DC, then find the angle between them.

Alternatively, I can compute vectors DB and DC and use the dot product to find the angle between them.

Let me try that.

Vector DB is from D(0,1) to B(-y,0): (-y - 0, 0 - 1) = (-y, -1)

Vector DC is from D(0,1) to C(y,0): (y - 0, 0 - 1) = (y, -1)

The angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC, which is 3θ.

The dot product of DB and DC is (-y)(y) + (-1)(-1) = -y² + 1.

The magnitude of DB is sqrt((-y)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(y² + 1)

Similarly, the magnitude of DC is sqrt(y² + 1)

So, the cosine of angle BDC is ( -y² + 1 ) / ( sqrt(y² + 1) * sqrt(y² + 1) ) = (1 - y²)/(y² + 1)

So, cos(angle BDC) = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²)

But angle BDC is 3θ, so cos(3θ) = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²)

Now, I need to find cos(3θ). Maybe I can express cos(3θ) in terms of cosθ, which is related to angle BAC.

Since angle BAC is θ, and triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, we can find cosθ.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ, and sides AB = AC = x, BC = 2y.

Using the Law of Cosines on triangle ABC:

BC² = AB² + AC² - 2*AB*AC*cosθ

(2y)² = x² + x² - 2x² cosθ

4y² = 2x² - 2x² cosθ

Divide both sides by 2:

2y² = x² - x² cosθ

But from earlier, we have x² = 121 + y², so substitute:

2y² = (121 + y²) - (121 + y²) cosθ

Let me rearrange:

2y² = 121 + y² - (121 + y²) cosθ

Bring 121 + y² to the left:

2y² - 121 - y² = - (121 + y²) cosθ

Simplify:

y² - 121 = - (121 + y²) cosθ

Multiply both sides by -1:

121 + y² - y² = (121 + y²) cosθ

Wait, that can't be right. Wait, let me check my steps.

Wait, 2y² = 121 + y² - (121 + y²) cosθ

So, 2y² - 121 - y² = - (121 + y²) cosθ

Which is y² - 121 = - (121 + y²) cosθ

So, cosθ = (121 - y²)/(121 + y²)

Wait, that seems correct.

So, cosθ = (121 - y²)/(121 + y²)

So, now, we have cos(3θ) = (1 - y²)/(1 + y²)

But we also have cos(3θ) in terms of cosθ. There's a trigonometric identity for cos(3θ):

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

So, let me write that:

cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ

But we have expressions for both cos(3θ) and cosθ in terms of y².

So, substituting:

(1 - y²)/(1 + y²) = 4[(121 - y²)/(121 + y²)]³ - 3[(121 - y²)/(121 + y²)]

This seems complicated, but maybe we can let t = y² to simplify the equation.

Let me set t = y². Then, the equation becomes:

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = 4[(121 - t)/(121 + t)]³ - 3[(121 - t)/(121 + t)]

This is a single equation in one variable t. Let me denote u = (121 - t)/(121 + t). Then, the equation becomes:

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = 4u³ - 3u

But u = (121 - t)/(121 + t). Let me express (1 - t)/(1 + t) in terms of u.

Wait, maybe it's better to express everything in terms of t.

Alternatively, let me compute both sides numerically.

Wait, perhaps cross-multiplying or finding a common denominator.

Alternatively, maybe cross-multiplying both sides.

But this seems messy. Maybe I can let s = t, so s = y².

Wait, perhaps another approach. Let me consider that both sides are functions of t, and maybe I can find t such that the equation holds.

Alternatively, maybe I can let t = 121k, so that t is a multiple of 121, but not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can let t = 121 - something.

Wait, perhaps I can let t = 121 - a, so that 121 - t = a, and 121 + t = 242 - a.

But not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can let t = 121 - 121m, so that 121 - t = 121m, and 121 + t = 121(1 + m). Maybe that can help.

Wait, perhaps it's better to just proceed step by step.

So, let me write the equation again:

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = 4[(121 - t)/(121 + t)]³ - 3[(121 - t)/(121 + t)]

Let me compute the right-hand side (RHS):

Let me denote u = (121 - t)/(121 + t). Then, RHS = 4u³ - 3u.

So, equation is:

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = 4u³ - 3u

But u = (121 - t)/(121 + t). Let me express (1 - t)/(1 + t) in terms of u.

Let me solve for t in terms of u.

From u = (121 - t)/(121 + t), cross-multiplying:

u(121 + t) = 121 - t

121u + ut = 121 - t

Bring terms with t to one side:

ut + t = 121 - 121u

t(u + 1) = 121(1 - u)

So, t = [121(1 - u)] / (u + 1)

So, t = 121*(1 - u)/(1 + u)

Now, let me compute (1 - t)/(1 + t):

(1 - t)/(1 + t) = [1 - 121*(1 - u)/(1 + u)] / [1 + 121*(1 - u)/(1 + u)]

Let me compute numerator and denominator separately.

Numerator:

1 - [121*(1 - u)/(1 + u)] = [ (1 + u) - 121*(1 - u) ] / (1 + u )

= [1 + u - 121 + 121u ] / (1 + u )

= [ (1 - 121) + (u + 121u) ] / (1 + u )

= [ -120 + 122u ] / (1 + u )

Denominator:

1 + [121*(1 - u)/(1 + u)] = [ (1 + u) + 121*(1 - u) ] / (1 + u )

= [1 + u + 121 - 121u ] / (1 + u )

= [ (1 + 121) + (u - 121u) ] / (1 + u )

= [ 122 - 120u ] / (1 + u )

So, (1 - t)/(1 + t) = [ (-120 + 122u ) / (1 + u ) ] / [ (122 - 120u ) / (1 + u ) ] = (-120 + 122u ) / (122 - 120u )

So, (1 - t)/(1 + t) = (122u - 120)/(122 - 120u )

But from earlier, (1 - t)/(1 + t) = 4u³ - 3u

So, we have:

(122u - 120)/(122 - 120u ) = 4u³ - 3u

Let me write this as:

(122u - 120) = (4u³ - 3u)(122 - 120u )

Let me compute the right-hand side:

(4u³ - 3u)(122 - 120u ) = 4u³*122 + 4u³*(-120u) - 3u*122 - 3u*(-120u )

= 488u³ - 480u⁴ - 366u + 360u²

So, the equation becomes:

122u - 120 = 488u³ - 480u⁴ - 366u + 360u²

Bring all terms to one side:

0 = 488u³ - 480u⁴ - 366u + 360u² - 122u + 120

Simplify:

Combine like terms:

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - (366u + 122u) + 120

= -480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - 488u + 120

So, equation is:

-480u⁴ + 488u³ + 360u² - 488u + 120 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

480u⁴ - 488u³ - 360u² + 488u - 120 = 0

This is a quartic equation, which is quite complicated. Maybe I can factor it.

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down into smaller parts. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the expression in the middle is x⁴ + 4x². That seems like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it easier. Let me try that.

So, if I let y = x², then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. That looks more manageable. Now, I can split this compound inequality into two separate inequalities:

1. -4 < y² + 4y
2. y² + 4y < 21

I'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions need to be satisfied.

Starting with the first inequality: -4 < y² + 4y.

Let me rearrange this to bring all terms to one side:

y² + 4y + 4 > 0

Wait, that's because I added 4 to both sides. So, y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, that looks like a perfect square. Let me check:

y² + 4y + 4 = (y + 2)²

Yes, that's correct. So, the inequality becomes (y + 2)² > 0. Now, a square is always non-negative, and it's only equal to zero when y + 2 = 0, which is y = -2. So, (y + 2)² > 0 means that y ≠ -2. But since y = x², and x² is always non-negative, y can't be negative. So, y is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, y can't be -2, which is already satisfied because y is non-negative. So, the first inequality simplifies to y ≠ -2, but since y is x², which is always ≥ 0, this condition is automatically true for all real x. So, the first inequality doesn't restrict the values of x any further.

Now, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.

Again, let's rearrange this to bring all terms to one side:

y² + 4y - 21 < 0

Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. First, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.

So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100.

That's a perfect square, so the roots are:

y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2

Calculating both roots:

First root: (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3

Second root: (-4 - 10)/2 = (-14)/2 = -7

So, the quadratic can be factored as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.

Now, to solve the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0, I can use a sign chart.

The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3. These divide the number line into three intervals:

1. y < -7
2. -7 < y < 3
3. y > 3

Now, let's test each interval:

1. For y < -7, say y = -8: (-8 - 3)(-8 + 7) = (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0
2. For -7 < y < 3, say y = 0: (0 - 3)(0 + 7) = (-3)(7) = -21 < 0
3. For y > 3, say y = 4: (4 - 3)(4 + 7) = (1)(11) = 11 > 0

So, the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 is satisfied when -7 < y < 3.

But remember, y = x², which is always non-negative. So, y cannot be less than 0. Therefore, the interval -7 < y < 3 is actually 0 ≤ y < 3.

So, combining these, y must satisfy 0 ≤ y < 3.

But y = x², so 0 ≤ x² < 3.

Now, solving for x:

x² < 3 implies that -√3 < x < √3.

And since x² is always non-negative, we don't need to worry about the lower bound beyond that.

So, putting it all together, the solution for x is -√3 < x < √3.

Wait, but let me double-check. The original inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. We transformed it into y² + 4y, found that the first inequality didn't restrict y, and the second inequality gave us y < 3. But is there a possibility that x⁴ + 4x² could be less than -4? But since x⁴ and 4x² are both non-negative, their sum is also non-negative. So, x⁴ + 4x² is always ≥ 0, which is greater than -4. So, the first inequality is automatically satisfied for all real x, as I thought earlier.

Therefore, the only restriction comes from the second inequality, which gives us x in (-√3, √3).

But just to be thorough, let me test a value inside the interval and outside to make sure.

Testing x = 0: x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0. So, -4 < 0 < 21, which is true.

Testing x = 1: 1 + 4 = 5. So, -4 < 5 < 21, which is true.

Testing x = √3: x⁴ + 4x² = ( (√3)^4 ) + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 12 = 21. So, 21 is not less than 21, so x = √3 is not included, which matches our interval.

Testing x = 2: x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32. 32 is not less than 21, so x = 2 is excluded, which is correct.

Testing x = -√3: same as x = √3, gives 21, which is not less than 21, so excluded.

Testing x = -2: same as x = 2, gives 32, which is excluded.

So, everything seems to check out.

Therefore, the solution is all real numbers x such that x is between -√3 and √3, not including the endpoints.

In interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, consider the inequality \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\). Rearranging gives:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0 \]
Since \((y + 2)^2\) is always non-negative and only zero when \(y = -2\), this inequality is satisfied for all \(y \neq -2\). However, since \(y = x^2\) is always non-negative, this condition is automatically true for all real \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). Rearranging gives:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = 3 \text{ and } -7 \]
The quadratic can be factored as \((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\). Testing intervals, we find the solution is \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, this reduces to \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Thus, \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\), which implies:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Therefore, the solution in interval notation is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, I need to find \( xy + yz + zx \). I remember that in problems involving symmetric sums, sometimes it's helpful to use identities or known formulas. Let me think about what I know.

First, I recall that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Maybe that could be useful here since I have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) and \( xyz \) given.

Let me compute \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \). Plugging in the given values:

\( 4 - 3 \times 4 = 4 - 12 = -8 \).

So, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = -8 \). According to the identity, this is equal to \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). Also, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) can be expressed in terms of \( S \) and \( P \) as \( S^2 - 2P \).

So, substituting into the identity:

\( -8 = S \times ( (S^2 - 2P) - P ) = S(S^2 - 3P) \).

So, \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \). Hmm, that's one equation involving \( S \) and \( P \). I need another equation to relate \( S \) and \( P \).

Looking at the third equation given: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). Let me see if I can factor this or express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \).

Notice that \( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \), similarly for the other terms. So, the entire expression can be written as:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \).

Which is equal to \( xyS - 3xyz \) because \( xy(x + y) = xyS - xyz \), and similarly for the others. Wait, let me check that.

Wait, actually, \( xy(x + y) = xyS - xyz \), because \( x + y = S - z \). So, \( xy(x + y) = xy(S - z) = xyS - xyz \). Similarly, \( xz(x + z) = xzS - xyz \), and \( yz(y + z) = yzS - xyz \).

So, adding them all together:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = (xyS - xyz) + (xzS - xyz) + (yzS - xyz) \).

Simplify:

\( (xy + xz + yz)S - 3xyz \).

Which is \( P \times S - 3Q \).

Given that this equals 12, so:

\( PS - 3Q = 12 \).

We know \( Q = 4 \), so:

\( PS - 12 = 12 \).

Wait, no, wait. Let me write it correctly:

\( PS - 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

So, \( PS - 12 = 12 \).

Therefore, \( PS = 24 \).

So, now I have two equations:

1. \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \)
2. \( PS = 24 \)

So, from the second equation, \( PS = 24 \), so \( P = 24 / S \).

Let me substitute \( P = 24 / S \) into the first equation:

\( S(S^2 - 3 \times (24 / S)) = -8 \).

Simplify inside the parentheses:

\( S^2 - 72 / S \).

Multiply by S:

\( S^3 - 72 = -8 \).

So, \( S^3 = -8 + 72 = 64 \).

Therefore, \( S = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \).

So, \( S = 4 \). Then, from \( PS = 24 \), \( P = 24 / 4 = 6 \).

So, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I used the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \), which gave me \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \). Then, I looked at the third equation and expressed it as \( PS - 3Q = 12 \), which with \( Q = 4 \) gave me \( PS = 24 \). Then, substituting \( P = 24/S \) into the first equation, I got \( S^3 - 72 = -8 \), so \( S^3 = 64 \), hence \( S = 4 \). Then, \( P = 24 / 4 = 6 \). That seems consistent.

Let me verify if these values make sense with the given equations.

If \( S = 4 \), \( P = 6 \), and \( Q = 4 \), then let's check the third equation:

\( PS - 3Q = 6 \times 4 - 3 \times 4 = 24 - 12 = 12 \). That's correct.

And for the first identity:

\( S(S^2 - 3P) = 4(16 - 18) = 4(-2) = -8 \). Which matches the earlier result.

So, it seems consistent. Therefore, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

**Final Answer**
\boxed{6}
</think>

Given the equations:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Substituting the given values:

\[ 4 - 3 \times 4 = -8 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \]

Let \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). We know that \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \). Substituting these into the identity, we get:

\[ S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \]

Next, we consider the third equation. We rewrite it as:

\[ xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12 \]

This can be expressed as:

\[ (xy + xz + yz)S - 3xyz = 12 \]

Substituting \( Q = 4 \), we get:

\[ PS - 12 = 12 \]

Thus,

\[ PS = 24 \]

We now have two equations:

1. \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \)
2. \( PS = 24 \)

From the second equation, \( P = \frac{24}{S} \). Substituting this into the first equation:

\[ S\left(S^2 - 3 \times \frac{24}{S}\right) = -8 \]

Simplifying inside the parentheses:

\[ S^3 - 72 = -8 \]

Thus,

\[ S^3 = 64 \]

So, \( S = 4 \). Substituting \( S = 4 \) back into \( PS = 24 \):

\[ P = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \]

Therefore, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is:

For the 9th grade:
- 135% of female bus riders = 1.35 * 118.2 = 159.03

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions, I need to consider the critical points where the expression can change its sign. Also, I should be careful about the denominator because it can't be zero, and it affects the sign of the entire expression.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

I know that the absolute value in the numerator, \(|x^2 - 81|\), is always non-negative because absolute values can't be negative. So, the numerator is either zero or positive. The denominator, \(x^2 - 36x\), is a quadratic expression, and I can factor it to find its roots. Let me factor both the numerator and the denominator.

Starting with the numerator: \(|x^2 - 81|\). I recognize that \(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). Therefore, the numerator becomes \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since the absolute value is applied to the entire expression, it doesn't factor into separate absolute values unless I know the sign of each term, which I don't yet. So, I'll keep it as \(|x^2 - 81|\) for now.

Now, the denominator: \(x^2 - 36x\). I can factor out an x, so it becomes \(x(x - 36)\). So, the denominator is \(x(x - 36)\). This means the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are critical points because the expression is undefined at these points, and the sign of the denominator can change around these values.

So, the critical points for the entire expression are where the numerator is zero or where the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which is when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). So, my critical points are at \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into intervals. I need to test each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval. The intervals are:

1. \( (-\infty, -9) \)
2. \( (-9, 0) \)
3. \( (0, 9) \)
4. \( (9, 36) \)
5. \( (36, \infty) \)

I should also consider the critical points themselves. However, since the inequality is strict (i.e., less than zero, not less than or equal to), the points where the expression is zero or undefined won't be included in the solution.

Let me analyze each interval one by one.

**1. Interval \( (-\infty, -9) \):**

Pick a test point, say \(x = -10\).

Numerator: \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\). So, positive.

Denominator: \((-10)^2 - 36*(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460\). So, positive.

Therefore, the expression is \(\frac{19}{460}\), which is positive. Since we're looking for where the expression is less than zero, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

**2. Interval \( (-9, 0) \):**

Let me choose \(x = -5\).

Numerator: \(|(-5)^2 - 81| = |25 - 81| = |-56| = 56\). Positive.

Denominator: \((-5)^2 - 36*(-5) = 25 + 180 = 205\). Positive.

So, the expression is \(\frac{56}{205}\), which is positive. Again, not less than zero. So, this interval isn't part of the solution.

**3. Interval \( (0, 9) \):**

Let me pick \(x = 1\).

Numerator: \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = |-80| = 80\). Positive.

Denominator: \(1^2 - 36*1 = 1 - 36 = -35\). Negative.

So, the expression is \(\frac{80}{-35}\), which is negative. Since we're looking for where the expression is less than zero, this interval is part of the solution.

**4. Interval \( (9, 36) \):**

Let me choose \(x = 10\).

Numerator: \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\). Positive.

Denominator: \(10^2 - 36*10 = 100 - 360 = -260\). Negative.

So, the expression is \(\frac{19}{-260}\), which is negative. Therefore, this interval is also part of the solution.

**5. Interval \( (36, \infty) \):**

Let me pick \(x = 40\).

Numerator: \(|40^2 - 81| = |1600 - 81| = |1519| = 1519\). Positive.

Denominator: \(40^2 - 36*40 = 1600 - 1440 = 160\). Positive.

So, the expression is \(\frac{1519}{160}\), which is positive. Not less than zero, so this interval isn't part of the solution.

Now, let me summarize the results:

- The expression is positive in intervals \( (-\infty, -9) \), \( (-9, 0) \), and \( (36, \infty) \).
- The expression is negative in intervals \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \).
- The expression is zero at \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), but since the inequality is strict, these points aren't included.
- The expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so these points are excluded as well.

Therefore, the solution set is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative, which are \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \). But wait, I should check if there's any overlap or if I need to consider the point at \(x = 9\). Since at \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the entire expression zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, \(x = 9\) is excluded.

But hold on, I should also consider the behavior around \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Since the expression is undefined at these points, they are not included in the solution. So, the solution is \(0 < x < 9\) and \(9 < x < 36\).

Wait, but let me double-check the interval \( (0, 9) \). When I tested \(x = 1\), the expression was negative, which is correct. Similarly, in \( (9, 36) \), the expression was negative as well. So, both intervals are valid.

But hold on, is there a point where the numerator is zero? At \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). But since \(x = -9\) is in the interval \( (-\infty, -9) \), which we already saw is positive, so it doesn't affect the solution. Similarly, \(x = 9\) is a point where the expression is zero, so it's excluded.

Wait, but let me think again about the numerator. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). So, at these points, the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, they are excluded.

Also, the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so the expression is undefined there, so these points are excluded as well.

Therefore, the solution is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 0, 9, and 36. But wait, in the interval \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \), the expression is negative, so the solution is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

But let me write this as a union of intervals: \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) \).

Wait, but I should also check if the expression is defined in these intervals. Since in \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \), the denominator is not zero, so the expression is defined. So, that's correct.

But hold on, let me think about the denominator again. The denominator is \(x(x - 36)\). So, for \(x\) between 0 and 36, the denominator is negative because \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, so their product is negative. For \(x\) less than 0, both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are negative, so their product is positive. For \(x\) greater than 36, both \(x\) and \(x - 36\) are positive, so their product is positive.

So, the denominator is negative in \( (0, 36) \) and positive otherwise.

The numerator is always non-negative because it's an absolute value. So, the entire expression is positive when the denominator is positive and negative when the denominator is negative.

Therefore, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is in \( (0, 36) \). But wait, in \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \), the denominator is negative, so the expression is negative. But at \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which is not less than zero.

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\), excluding \(x = 9\). So, \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) \).

Wait, but earlier I thought the expression is negative in \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \). So, that's consistent.

But let me also check the behavior around \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). As \(x\) approaches 0 from the right, the denominator approaches 0 from the negative side (since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, so denominator approaches 0 from negative). The numerator approaches \(|0 - 81| = 81\). So, the expression approaches \(-\infty\). Similarly, as \(x\) approaches 36 from the left, the denominator approaches 0 from the negative side, and the numerator approaches \(|36^2 - 81| = |1296 - 81| = 1215\). So, the expression approaches \(-\infty\).

Therefore, the expression is negative throughout \( (0, 36) \), except at \(x = 9\) where it's zero. So, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\), excluding \(x = 9\).

Wait, but earlier I thought the solution was \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) \). So, that's the same as \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\). So, both ways of writing are correct.

But let me confirm with another test point in \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \).

For \(x = 5\) in \( (0, 9) \):

Numerator: \(|25 - 81| = 56\). Positive.

Denominator: \(25 - 180 = -155\). Negative.

So, expression is negative.

For \(x = 20\) in \( (9, 36) \):

Numerator: \(|400 - 81| = 319\). Positive.

Denominator: \(400 - 720 = -320\). Negative.

Expression is negative.

So, both intervals are correct.

But wait, what about \(x = -10\), which is in \( (-\infty, -9) \):

Numerator: \(|100 - 81| = 19\). Positive.

Denominator: \(100 - (-360) = 460\). Positive.

Expression is positive.

Similarly, \(x = -5\) in \( (-9, 0) \):

Numerator: \(|25 - 81| = 56\). Positive.

Denominator: \(25 - (-180) = 205\). Positive.

Expression is positive.

So, indeed, the expression is negative only in \( (0, 36) \) excluding \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) with \(x \neq 9\).

But let me write this as two intervals: \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \).

So, in boxed form, the solution is \(x \in (0, 9) \cup (9, 36)\).

Wait, but I should also consider if the expression is defined in these intervals. Since in \( (0, 36) \), the denominator is negative, but not zero except at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), which are excluded. So, yes, the expression is defined in \( (0, 36) \) except at \(x = 9\), where it's zero.

Therefore, the final solution is \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\","[9, '9']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular field enclosed in an athletic track. The track consists of two edges of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters, and I need to find the largest possible area of the field. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, the Asymptote code draws a rectangle with two semicircles on either end. So, the track is like a rectangle with semicircular ends, right? That makes sense because athletic tracks often have straightaways and curved ends. So, the two straight sides are the edges of the rectangle, and the two semicircles complete the track.

Let me denote the length of the rectangle as 'L' and the width as 'W'. Since the track includes two semicircles, each with a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, the circumference of each semicircle would be half the circumference of a full circle. The circumference of a full circle is π times the diameter, so a semicircle would be (π * W)/2. But since there are two semicircles, one on each end, the total length contributed by the semicircles would be π * W.

Now, the total length of the track is given as 400 meters. The track consists of the two straight sides (each of length L) and the two semicircular ends. So, the total length should be 2L + πW = 400 meters. That gives me the equation:

2L + πW = 400

I need to find the maximum area of the field, which is a rectangle. The area A of the rectangle is given by:

A = L * W

So, I have two equations:

1. 2L + πW = 400
2. A = L * W

My goal is to maximize A. Since I have two variables, L and W, I can express one variable in terms of the other using the first equation and substitute it into the area formula. Then, I can take the derivative with respect to one variable and find the maximum.

Let me solve the first equation for L:

2L = 400 - πW

Divide both sides by 2:

L = (400 - πW)/2

Simplify:

L = 200 - (π/2)W

Now, substitute this expression for L into the area formula:

A = L * W = [200 - (π/2)W] * W

Multiply it out:

A = 200W - (π/2)W²

So, now I have A as a function of W:

A(W) = 200W - (π/2)W²

This is a quadratic function in terms of W, and since the coefficient of W² is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

To find the maximum area, I can find the vertex of this parabola. The vertex occurs at W = -b/(2a) for a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c. In this case, a = -π/2 and b = 200.

So, plugging into the formula:

W = -b/(2a) = -200 / (2 * (-π/2)) = -200 / (-π) = 200/π

So, the width W that maximizes the area is 200/π meters.

Now, let's find the corresponding length L using the expression we had earlier:

L = 200 - (π/2)W

Substitute W = 200/π:

L = 200 - (π/2)*(200/π) = 200 - (200/2) = 200 - 100 = 100 meters

So, the length L is 100 meters.

Now, let's compute the maximum area A:

A = L * W = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π square meters

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the track length:

2L + πW = 400

We solved for L:

L = (400 - πW)/2

Then substituted into A = L*W:

A = (400 - πW)/2 * W = (400W - πW²)/2 = 200W - (π/2)W²

Yes, that's correct.

Then, taking the derivative of A with respect to W:

dA/dW = 200 - πW

Setting derivative equal to zero for maximum:

200 - πW = 0 => W = 200/π

Yes, that's correct.

Then, plugging back into L:

L = 200 - (π/2)*(200/π) = 200 - 100 = 100

So, L = 100 meters.

Therefore, the area is 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π

Calculating that numerically, π is approximately 3.1416, so 20000 / 3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977 square meters.

But since the problem asks for the answer in terms of π, I should leave it as 20000/π.

Wait, hold on, let me think again. Is this the correct approach?

Alternatively, sometimes in optimization problems, especially with two variables, using calculus is the way to go, but I just want to make sure I didn't make a mistake in setting up the equations.

The track is made up of two straight sides of length L and two semicircular ends with diameter W. So, the total length is 2L + πW = 400. That seems right because each semicircle has a circumference of (πW)/2, and two of them make πW.

So, yes, 2L + πW = 400 is correct.

Expressing L in terms of W: L = (400 - πW)/2, which is 200 - (π/2)W. Correct.

Then, area A = L*W = (200 - (π/2)W) * W = 200W - (π/2)W². Correct.

Taking derivative: dA/dW = 200 - πW. Setting to zero: 200 - πW = 0 => W = 200/π. Correct.

Then, L = 200 - (π/2)*(200/π) = 200 - 100 = 100. Correct.

So, area is 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π. So, that's approximately 6366.1977 m², but since the problem doesn't specify, I think leaving it in terms of π is better.

Wait, but let me think again. Is the area of the field the area of the rectangle? Yes, because the field is rectangular, enclosed by the track. So, the area is indeed L*W.

Alternatively, sometimes in these problems, people might confuse the area of the track with the area of the field, but in this case, the field is the rectangle, so it's just L*W.

So, I think my approach is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is to use the method of completing the square or using the vertex formula for a parabola, which I did.

Alternatively, if I didn't use calculus, I could note that the quadratic function A(W) = - (π/2)W² + 200W is a downward opening parabola, so its maximum is at the vertex, which is at W = -b/(2a). Here, a = -π/2, b = 200, so W = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = 200/π, same as before.

So, that's consistent.

Therefore, I think my answer is correct.

**Final Answer**
The largest possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.
</think>

Given a rectangular field enclosed in an athletic track, the track consists of two edges of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the largest possible area of the field.

First, we denote the length of the rectangle as \( L \) and the width as \( W \). The total length of the track is given by the sum of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. This gives us the equation:

\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We aim to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:

\[ A = L \times W \]

Expressing \( L \) in terms of \( W \) from the track length equation:

\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} W \]

Substituting this into the area formula:

\[ A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi}{2} W\right) \times W \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi}{2} W^2 \]

This is a quadratic function in terms of \( W \). To find the maximum area, we determine the vertex of this parabola. The vertex occurs at:

\[ W = \frac{-b}{2a} \]

For the quadratic function \( A(W) = -\frac{\pi}{2} W^2 + 200W \), we have \( a = -\frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( b = 200 \). Thus,

\[ W = \frac{-200}{2 \times -\frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \times \frac{200}{\pi} = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The maximum area \( A \) is then:

\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Thus, the largest possible area of the field is:

"Okay, so I have this triangle RST, and it's a right triangle because there's a right angle at S. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, RS is the vertical side from (2,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), which means RS has a length of sqrt(21). ST is the horizontal side from (0,0) to (2,0), so that's length 2. RT is the hypotenuse, connecting (0,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), and the Asymptote code labels it as 5. So, RT is 5 units long.

They told me that sin R is 2/5, and they want me to find sin T. Hmm, okay. Let me recall some trigonometry basics. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, which is at point R, the opposite side would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT. Wait, let me make sure: in triangle RST, angle R is at point R, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle R would be... Let me visualize the triangle.

Point R is at the top, S is the right angle, and T is the other point. So, angle R is at the top, angle S is the right angle, and angle T is at the origin. So, in triangle RST, angle R is opposite side ST, which is length 2, and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST/RT = 2/5. That matches what they told me, so that's good.

Now, they want sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is the origin. So, in triangle RST, angle T is opposite side RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = RS/RT = sqrt(21)/5. So, is that the answer? Wait, let me make sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that in a right triangle, the two non-right angles are complementary. So, angle R and angle T add up to 90 degrees. Therefore, sin R = cos T, and sin T = cos R. Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If angle R + angle T = 90 degrees, then angle T = 90 - angle R. So, sin T = sin(90 - R) = cos R. Similarly, cos T = sin R. So, if sin R is 2/5, then cos T is 2/5, which would mean sin T is sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. So, that's consistent with what I found earlier.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the sides. Wait, we already have the sides: RS is sqrt(21), ST is 2, and RT is 5. So, RS^2 + ST^2 = (sqrt(21))^2 + 2^2 = 21 + 4 = 25, which is equal to RT^2, so that checks out.

So, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, which is RS/RT = sqrt(21)/5. So, that should be the answer.

Wait, let me just make sure I didn't mix up the sides. For angle T, the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21), and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5. So, yes, sin T = sqrt(21)/5. Alternatively, if I think about the coordinates, point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, the triangle is right-angled at S, so the sides are ST = 2, RS = sqrt(21), and RT = 5.

So, for angle T, which is at (0,0), the sides adjacent to it are ST (2) and the hypotenuse RT (5). The side opposite angle T is RS (sqrt(21)). So, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = sqrt(21)/5. Yep, that seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates to find the sine. The coordinates of R are (2, sqrt(21)), so the vector from T to R is (2, sqrt(21)). The length of that vector is 5, as given. So, the sine of angle T would be the y-component over the length, which is sqrt(21)/5. That's another way to see it.

So, I think I've confirmed it multiple ways: sin T is sqrt(21)/5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}
</think>

In $\triangle RST$, we are given that $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$ and need to find $\sin T$. 

First, we note that $\triangle RST$ is a right triangle with the right angle at $S$. The sides of the triangle are as follows:
- $ST = 2$
- $RS = \sqrt{21}$
- $RT = 5$ (the hypotenuse)

We know that $\sin R = \frac{2}{5}$, which is the ratio of the opposite side $ST$ to the hypotenuse $RT$. 

To find $\sin T$, we use the fact that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For angle $T$, the opposite side is $RS$ and the hypotenuse is $RT$. Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

"Okay, so I need to find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). Hmm, the distance from the origin to any point (x, y) is given by the distance formula, which is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since I want the smallest distance, I should probably minimize this distance. But working with square roots can be a bit tricky, so maybe I can instead minimize the square of the distance to make the calculations easier. That should give me the same result because the square root function is monotonically increasing.

So, let me define the distance squared as a function of x. Let's call it D:

\( D = x^2 + y^2 \)

But since y is given by the function, I can substitute that in:

\( D = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \)

Let me simplify that expression step by step. First, square the y term:

\( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 (x^2 - 3)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

So now, D becomes:

\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

Alright, now I need to find the value of x that minimizes D. To do this, I can take the derivative of D with respect to x, set it equal to zero, and solve for x. That should give me the critical points, which could be minima or maxima. Then I can check to make sure it's a minimum.

Let's compute the derivative D'. First, expand the expression for D to make differentiation easier.

First, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \)

So, substituting back into D:

\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \)

Let me distribute the 1/2:

\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

Combine like terms:

\( D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 + (x^2 - 3x^2) + \frac{9}{2} \)
\( D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

Now, take the derivative D' with respect to x:

\( D' = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) \)
\( D' = 2x^3 - 4x \)

Set D' equal to zero to find critical points:

\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \)
Factor out 2x:

\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \)

So, the critical points are at x = 0 and x^2 - 2 = 0, which gives x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2).

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives a minimum distance. Since distance can't be negative, and we're dealing with a function that's symmetric in x (since y depends on x^2), I can consider x >= 0 and the results will apply to x <= 0 as well.

Let me evaluate D at each critical point.

First, at x = 0:

\( D = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \)

So, the distance squared is 9/2, which means the distance is 3/sqrt(2). But let's see the other critical points.

At x = sqrt(2):

Compute D:

\( D = \frac{1}{2}(sqrt(2))^4 - 2(sqrt(2))^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

First, compute each term:

\( (sqrt(2))^4 = (2)^2 = 4 \)
\( (sqrt(2))^2 = 2 \)

So,

\( D = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} \)
\( D = 2 - 4 + 4.5 \)
\( D = (2 - 4) + 4.5 = (-2) + 4.5 = 2.5 \)

Which is 5/2. So, D is 5/2 at x = sqrt(2). Similarly, at x = -sqrt(2), since the function is even, D will be the same.

So, comparing D at x=0 (which is 9/2 = 4.5) and at x = sqrt(2) (which is 5/2 = 2.5). Clearly, 2.5 is smaller, so the minimum distance occurs at x = sqrt(2) and x = -sqrt(2).

Therefore, the minimal distance squared is 5/2, so the minimal distance is sqrt(5/2). But the problem says it can be expressed as sqrt(a)/b, where a and b are positive integers, and a is square-free.

Let me write sqrt(5/2) as sqrt(5)/sqrt(2). But sqrt(2) is irrational, so to rationalize the denominator, we can write it as sqrt(10)/2. Because sqrt(5)/sqrt(2) = sqrt(5)*sqrt(2)/2 = sqrt(10)/2.

So, sqrt(10)/2 is the minimal distance. Therefore, a is 10 and b is 2. Since 10 is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than one (its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither of which are squared), this satisfies the condition.

Therefore, a + b = 10 + 2 = 12.

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

First, I set up the distance squared correctly: x^2 + y^2, substituted y correctly, expanded, took the derivative, found critical points, evaluated D at those points, and found that x = sqrt(2) gives a smaller D. Then, converted sqrt(5/2) to sqrt(10)/2, which is correct because sqrt(5/2) = sqrt(10)/2.

Yes, that seems right. So, a is 10, b is 2, so a + b is 12.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{12}
</think>

To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance squared from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance squared is given by:

\[ D = x^2 + y^2 \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]

Thus,

\[ D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \]
\[ D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( D \) with respect to \( x \):

\[ D' = 2x^3 - 4x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero:

\[ 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives the critical points \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Evaluating \( D \) at these points:

- At \( x = 0 \):
  \[ D = \frac{9}{2} \]

- At \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
  \[ D = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + 4.5 = 2.5 = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimum distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \). Expressing this as \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), we find \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 12 \).

"Okay, so I have this function f defined piecewise, and I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, let me write down the function first to make sure I understand it correctly.

The function f(x) is defined as:
- 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3,
- -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3.

So, f(x) has two different expressions depending on whether x is less than or equal to 3 or greater than 3. I need to find the inverse function values at 0 and 6, then add them together.

First, let me recall what an inverse function does. If f(a) = b, then f inverse of b is a. So, to find f inverse of 0, I need to find the value of x such that f(x) = 0. Similarly, for f inverse of 6, I need to find x such that f(x) = 6.

Since f is piecewise, I should check both pieces for each value.

Starting with f inverse of 0. Let's set f(x) = 0 and solve for x.

Case 1: x ≤ 3. Then f(x) = 3 - x. So, 3 - x = 0. Solving for x, I get x = 3. Since 3 is equal to 3, this is a valid solution in this case.

Case 2: x > 3. Then f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. So, set that equal to 0: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Let me factor this equation.

First, factor out a -x: -x(x² - 2x - 3) = 0. So, either -x = 0, which gives x = 0, but x > 3, so this is not valid. Or, x² - 2x - 3 = 0. Let's solve this quadratic equation.

Using the quadratic formula: x = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2. So, x = (2 + 4)/2 = 3 or x = (2 - 4)/2 = -1. Again, x must be greater than 3, so neither 3 nor -1 are valid in this case. Therefore, the only solution is x = 3 from the first case.

So, f inverse of 0 is 3.

Now, moving on to f inverse of 6. Again, set f(x) = 6 and solve for x.

Case 1: x ≤ 3. Then f(x) = 3 - x. So, 3 - x = 6. Solving for x, subtract 3 from both sides: -x = 3, so x = -3. Since -3 is less than or equal to 3, this is a valid solution.

Case 2: x > 3. Then f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. So, set that equal to 6: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Let's rearrange this equation: -x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0.

Hmm, solving a cubic equation. Let me see if I can factor this. Maybe try rational roots. The possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Let me test x = 1: -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = (-1 + 2) + (3 - 6) = 1 - 3 = -2 ≠ 0.

x = 2: -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = (-8 + 8) + (6 - 6) = 0 + 0 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root. But wait, x = 2 is not greater than 3, so it's not in the domain for this case. Hmm, but maybe I can factor it out.

Since x = 2 is a root, let's factor (x - 2) out of the cubic polynomial. Let me perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with root 2:

Coefficients: -1 (x³), 2 (x²), 3 (x), -6 (constant).

Bring down -1.

Multiply -1 by 2: -2. Add to next coefficient: 2 + (-2) = 0.

Multiply 0 by 2: 0. Add to next coefficient: 3 + 0 = 3.

Multiply 3 by 2: 6. Add to last coefficient: -6 + 6 = 0. Perfect, so the cubic factors as (x - 2)(-x² + 0x + 3) = (x - 2)(-x² + 3).

So, the equation becomes (x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0. So, the roots are x = 2 and the roots of -x² + 3 = 0, which is x² = 3, so x = sqrt(3) and x = -sqrt(3). But again, x must be greater than 3, so none of these roots (2, sqrt(3) ≈ 1.732, -sqrt(3) ≈ -1.732) are greater than 3. Therefore, in this case, there is no solution.

So, the only solution is x = -3 from the first case.

Therefore, f inverse of 6 is -3.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. If x = -3, which is less than or equal to 3, then f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6. That's correct. So, f(-3) = 6, so f inverse of 6 is indeed -3.

So, f inverse of 0 is 3, and f inverse of 6 is -3. Therefore, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For f inverse of 0: f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0, correct. And for f inverse of 6: f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6, correct. So, 3 + (-3) is 0. Hmm, that seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other solutions in the second piece for f inverse of 6. So, in the second case, x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. We set that equal to 6 and found that the only roots were x = 2, sqrt(3), and -sqrt(3), none of which are greater than 3. So, no solution in that case. So, only x = -3 is the solution.

Similarly, for f inverse of 0, in the second case, x > 3, we had the equation -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0, which gave roots at x = 0, 3, and -1, none of which are greater than 3 except x = 3, but x = 3 is in the first case. So, only x = 3 is the solution.

Therefore, f inverse of 0 is 3, f inverse of 6 is -3, so their sum is 0.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me graph the function in my mind. For x ≤ 3, it's a linear function decreasing from f(3) = 0 to the left. For x > 3, it's a cubic function. Let me see, as x increases beyond 3, what does f(x) do?

The cubic term is negative, so as x becomes large, f(x) tends to negative infinity. At x = 3, let's compute f(3) from the second piece: -27 + 18 + 9 = 0. So, it's continuous at x = 3. Then, for x just above 3, let's compute f(4): -64 + 32 + 12 = (-64 + 32) + 12 = (-32) + 12 = -20. So, it's decreasing from 0 to negative values as x increases beyond 3.

So, the function f(x) is decreasing on both sides of x = 3, but the left side is linear and the right side is a cubic that goes to negative infinity. So, for f inverse of 0, it's only at x = 3, and for f inverse of 6, it's only at x = -3.

Therefore, adding them together, 3 + (-3) = 0.

I think that's correct. So, the answer is 0.

To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) for the piecewise function \( f \) defined as:

\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. **Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), solve \( 3 - x = 0 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
   - For \( x > 3 \), solve \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \):
     \[ -x(x^2 - 2x - 3) = 0 \implies x = 0 \text{ or } x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0. \]
     Solving \( x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \) gives \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \), neither of which are greater than 3.
   - Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), solve \( 3 - x = 6 \):
     \[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
   - For \( x > 3 \), solve \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \):
     \[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
     Factoring gives \( (x - 2)(-x^2 + 3) = 0 \), leading to roots \( x = 2 \), \( x = \sqrt{3} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \), none of which are greater than 3.
   - Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results together, we get:
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a regular octahedron, and a point P inside it. The distances from P to five of the vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular octahedron has eight triangular faces, six vertices, and twelve edges. It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases.

First, I should probably visualize the octahedron. The Asymptote code shows that the octahedron is centered at the origin, with vertices at (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), and (0,0,-1). So, it's symmetric along all axes. Point P is somewhere inside this octahedron, and we know the distances to five of these vertices.

I think the key here is to use some sort of geometric property or formula that relates the distances from a point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices. Maybe something to do with the sum of squares of the distances or something like that? I'm not entirely sure, but I remember that in some regular polyhedrons, there are relationships between the distances from an internal point to the vertices.

Let me think. For a regular octahedron, each vertex is equidistant from the center. The center is at (0,0,0), right? So, if P is at some point (x,y,z), then the distances from P to each vertex can be expressed in terms of x, y, z.

Let me write down the coordinates of the vertices:

A = (1,0,0)
B = (-1,0,0)
C = (0,1,0)
D = (0,-1,0)
E = (0,0,1)
F = (0,0,-1)

So, the distance from P = (x,y,z) to each vertex is:

PA = sqrt((x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)
PB = sqrt((x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)
PC = sqrt(x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2)
PD = sqrt(x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2)
PE = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2)
PF = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2)

We know five of these distances: 3, 7, 8, 9, 11. Let's say, for example, PA = 3, PB = 7, PC = 8, PD = 9, PE = 11, and we need to find PF. But actually, the problem doesn't specify which distances correspond to which vertices, so maybe the order doesn't matter? Or maybe it does? Hmm, not sure.

But perhaps instead of trying to assign specific distances to specific vertices, I can use a property that relates all these distances together. I recall that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any interior point to the vertices is constant. Is that true? Wait, let me think.

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices might have a relationship. Let me try to compute the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices.

So, let's compute PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF².

From the coordinates above, PA² = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
Similarly, PB² = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
PC² = x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2
PD² = x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2
PE² = x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2
PF² = x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2

Let me add all these up:

PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF²
= [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]

Let me expand each term:

First term: (x² - 2x + 1) + y² + z²
Second term: (x² + 2x + 1) + y² + z²
Third term: x² + (y² - 2y + 1) + z²
Fourth term: x² + (y² + 2y + 1) + z²
Fifth term: x² + y² + (z² - 2z + 1)
Sixth term: x² + y² + (z² + 2z + 1)

Now, let's add all these together:

First, let's collect like terms.

For x² terms:
First term: x²
Second term: x²
Third term: x²
Fourth term: x²
Fifth term: x²
Sixth term: x²
Total x² terms: 6x²

For y² terms:
First term: y²
Second term: y²
Third term: y²
Fourth term: y²
Fifth term: y²
Sixth term: y²
Total y² terms: 6y²

For z² terms:
First term: z²
Second term: z²
Third term: z²
Fourth term: z²
Fifth term: z²
Sixth term: z²
Total z² terms: 6z²

Now, the linear terms:

From first term: -2x
From second term: +2x
From third term: -2y
From fourth term: +2y
From fifth term: -2z
From sixth term: +2z

Adding these: (-2x + 2x) + (-2y + 2y) + (-2z + 2z) = 0

Constant terms:

From first term: +1
From second term: +1
From third term: +1
From fourth term: +1
From fifth term: +1
From sixth term: +1
Total constants: 6*1 = 6

So, putting it all together:

PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF² = 6x² + 6y² + 6z² + 6

Factor out the 6:

= 6(x² + y² + z² + 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is equal to 6 times (x² + y² + z² + 1). But wait, x² + y² + z² is the square of the distance from P to the origin, right? Let's denote OP = sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, OP² = x² + y² + z².

Therefore, the sum becomes 6(OP² + 1). So, PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF² = 6(OP² + 1)

But is this sum a constant? It seems to depend on OP, which is the distance from P to the center. So, unless OP is fixed, the sum isn't a constant. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, but in the problem, P is a fixed point, so OP is fixed. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is fixed as 6(OP² + 1). So, if we know five of the distances, we can compute the sixth.

Let me denote the unknown distance as d. Then, the sum of the squares of the five known distances plus d² equals 6(OP² + 1). But we don't know OP². Hmm, so maybe we can express OP² in terms of the known distances?

Wait, let's see. Let me denote S = PA² + PB² + PC² + PD² + PE² + PF² = 6(OP² + 1). So, if I can compute S, then I can find OP², and then use that to find the missing distance.

But since we don't know one of the distances, let's say PF is the unknown, then S = 3² + 7² + 8² + 9² + 11² + d². So, S = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d². Let me compute that:

9 + 49 = 58
58 + 64 = 122
122 + 81 = 203
203 + 121 = 324
So, S = 324 + d²

But S is also equal to 6(OP² + 1). So, 324 + d² = 6(OP² + 1). Therefore, 6(OP² + 1) = 324 + d².

But we need another equation to relate OP² and d. Hmm, maybe we can find OP² in another way.

Wait, let's think about the coordinates. Since the octahedron is regular and centered at the origin, maybe there's a relationship between the coordinates of P and the distances to the vertices.

Alternatively, perhaps we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each pair of opposite vertices is equal. For example, PA² + PB², PC² + PD², PE² + PF². Maybe each of these sums is equal?

Wait, let's check that. Let's compute PA² + PB²:

PA² = (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
PB² = (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
Adding them: (x² - 2x + 1 + y² + z²) + (x² + 2x + 1 + y² + z²) = 2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2

Similarly, PC² + PD²:

PC² = x² + (y - 1)^2 + z²
PD² = x² + (y + 1)^2 + z²
Adding them: 2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2

Same with PE² + PF²:

PE² = x² + y² + (z - 1)^2
PF² = x² + y² + (z + 1)^2
Adding them: 2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2

So, indeed, each pair of opposite vertices has the sum of squares equal to 2x² + 2y² + 2z² + 2, which is 2(OP² + 1). So, each pair sums to the same value.

Therefore, if we denote the pairs as (PA² + PB²), (PC² + PD²), (PE² + PF²), each is equal to 2(OP² + 1). So, if we can compute two of these sums, we can find OP².

But in our problem, we have five distances. Let's see, if we can group them into two pairs and one single distance, then maybe we can compute OP².

Wait, but we have five distances, so maybe one pair is known, another pair is known, and the fifth is part of the third pair. Let me think.

Suppose, for example, that PA = 3, PB = 7, PC = 8, PD = 9, PE = 11, and PF is unknown. Then, PA² + PB² = 9 + 49 = 58, PC² + PD² = 64 + 81 = 145, and PE² + PF² = 121 + d².

But from earlier, each pair should sum to 2(OP² + 1). So, 58 = 2(OP² + 1), 145 = 2(OP² + 1), and 121 + d² = 2(OP² + 1). But wait, 58 and 145 can't both equal 2(OP² + 1) unless 58 = 145, which is not true. So, that can't be.

Hmm, so maybe my assumption about which distances correspond to which vertices is wrong. Maybe the given distances don't include both distances from a pair. So, perhaps the five given distances include only one from each pair, and the sixth is the remaining one.

Wait, but there are three pairs: (A,B), (C,D), (E,F). So, if we have five distances, that would mean we have both distances from two pairs and one distance from the third pair. So, for example, we have PA, PB, PC, PD, and PE, and need PF. Then, PA² + PB² = 2(OP² + 1), PC² + PD² = 2(OP² + 1), and PE² + PF² = 2(OP² + 1). So, in this case, we can compute OP² from the first two pairs, and then use that to find PF.

But in the problem, the distances are given as 3,7,8,9,11. So, perhaps two of these are from one pair, two from another, and one from the third. But without knowing which ones, it's tricky.

Wait, but maybe regardless of the pairing, the sum of all six distances squared is 6(OP² + 1). So, if I can compute the sum of the squares of the five known distances, add the square of the unknown distance, and set it equal to 6(OP² + 1). But I don't know OP².

Alternatively, maybe I can find OP² from the known distances. Let me think.

Wait, if I have two pairs, each summing to 2(OP² + 1), then I can compute OP² from each pair and set them equal. For example, if I have PA² + PB² = 2(OP² + 1) and PC² + PD² = 2(OP² + 1), then PA² + PB² = PC² + PD². So, if I can group the given distances into two pairs with equal sums, then I can find OP².

"First, I recognize that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration, as stated by the formula \( F = m \times a \).

Given the masses of the balls, the softball has a mass of 200 grams and the baseball has a mass of 150 grams. I can set up the equation \( 200 \times a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \times a_{\text{baseball}} \).

To find the ratio of the accelerations, I divide both sides of the equation by 150 and then by 200, resulting in \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \).

Simplifying the fraction \( \frac{150}{200} \) by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by 50 gives \( \frac{3}{4} \).

- \( a \) is the acceleration.

To find the ratio \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \), divide both sides by \( 150 \) and then by \( 200 \):

\[
\frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4}

"First, there are six witches and ten sorcerers at the mixer.

Each witch shakes hands with each sorcerer. So, for one witch, there are 10 handshakes.

Since there are six witches, the total number of handshakes is 6 multiplied by 10, which equals 60.

There are no handshakes between witches or between sorcerers, as specified.

Therefore, the total number of handshakes that took place at the mixer is 60.
</think>

To determine the total number of handshakes at the mixer, let's break down the interactions:

1. **Witches and Sorcerers:**
   - There are **6 witches** and **10 sorcerers**.
   - Each witch shakes hands with each sorcerer.
   - Number of handshakes between witches and sorcerers:
     \[
     6 \text{ witches} \times 10 \text{ sorcerers} = 60 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

2. **Witches and Witches:**
   - The witches are already good friends and do not shake hands with each other.
   - Number of handshakes among witches:
     \[
     0
     \]

3. **Sorcerers and Sorcerers:**
   - The sorcerers do not shake hands with each other.
   - Number of handshakes among sorcerers:
     \[
     0
     \]

**Total Handshakes:**
\[
60 \text{ (witches and sorcerers)} + 0 \text{ (witches and witches)} + 0 \text{ (sorcerers and sorcerers)} = 60
\]

"To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), which is \( f(x - 1) \), I can use a simple shortcut. Instead of expanding the entire polynomial, I can substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( g(x) \). This works because substituting \( x = 1 \) into a polynomial effectively sums all its coefficients.

So, \( g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) \).

Now, I'll calculate \( f(0) \) by substituting \( x = 0 \) into the original polynomial:

\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2
\]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \(-2\).
</think>

To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x - 1) \), we can use a simple shortcut. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Given that \( g(x) = f(x - 1) \), we have:

\[
g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0)
\]

Now, let's compute \( f(0) \) using the original polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):

\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2, I can use the distance formula for a point to a line.

First, I'll rewrite the line equation in standard form, which is Ax + By + C = 0. Starting with y = 2x - 2, I'll subtract 2x and add 2 to both sides to get -2x + y + 2 = 0. This means A is -2, B is 1, and C is 2.

Next, I'll apply the distance formula: distance = |A*x0 + B*y0 + C| / sqrt(A² + B²). Plugging in the values, I have |(-2)*6 + 1*0 + 2| / sqrt((-2)² + 1²).

Calculating the numerator: |-12 + 0 + 2| = |-10| = 10.

Calculating the denominator: sqrt(4 + 1) = sqrt(5).

So, the distance is 10 divided by the square root of 5. To simplify, I'll rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by sqrt(5), resulting in (10*sqrt(5)) / 5, which simplifies to 2*sqrt(5).

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point (6, 0) to the line y = 2x - 2 is 2 times the square root of 5.
</think>

To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the distance formula for a point to a line. The formula is:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, let's rewrite the equation of the line in standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies -2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = -2\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = 2\).

Now, plug the coordinates of the point \((x_0, y_0) = (6, 0)\) into the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|-2 \cdot 6 + 1 \cdot 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|-10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator:

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10 \cdot \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the unordered set containing the expressions α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, and α₁α₄ + α₂α₃, where α₁, α₂, α₃, and α₄ are the four distinct roots of the equation x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but I think I can figure it out using Vieta's formulas. Let me recall what Vieta's formulas say about the roots of a polynomial.

For a quartic equation like x⁴ + a x³ + b x² + c x + d = 0, the sums and products of the roots can be related to the coefficients. Specifically, if the roots are α₁, α₂, α₃, α₄, then:

1. α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -a
2. α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = b
3. α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = -c
4. α₁α₂α₃α₄ = d

In our case, the equation is x⁴ + 2x³ + 2 = 0, so comparing to the general form, a = 2, b = 0 (since there's no x² term), c = 0 (since there's no x term), and d = 2. So applying Vieta's formulas:

1. α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2
2. α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0
3. α₁α₂α₃ + α₁α₂α₄ + α₁α₃α₄ + α₂α₃α₄ = 0
4. α₁α₂α₃α₄ = 2

Okay, so I need to find the set {α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, α₁α₄ + α₂α₃}. Let me denote these three expressions as S₁, S₂, S₃ respectively. So S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

I notice that each of these expressions is a sum of two products of roots. If I add all three together, S₁ + S₂ + S₃, that would be equal to (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄) + (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) + (α₁α₄ + α₂α₃). Let me compute that:

S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄

Wait, that's exactly the second Vieta's formula, which is equal to 0. So S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0.

That's a good start. Now, I need more information to find the individual values of S₁, S₂, S₃. Maybe I can find the products of these expressions or something else.

Let me think about the products S₁S₂, S₁S₃, and S₂S₃. Maybe that can help. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the squares of the sums or something like that.

Alternatively, maybe I can consider the expression (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄). Let me compute that:

(α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄) = α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ = S₂ + S₃

Similarly, (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₃α₄ = S₁ + S₃

And (α₁ + α₄)(α₂ + α₃) = α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = S₁ + S₂

Hmm, interesting. So each of these products is equal to the sum of two of the S's. Let me denote:

Let me define T₁ = α₁ + α₂, T₂ = α₁ + α₃, T₃ = α₁ + α₄, T₄ = α₂ + α₃, T₅ = α₂ + α₄, T₆ = α₃ + α₄. But that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe instead of that, I can consider the products (α₁ + α₂)(α₃ + α₄), (α₁ + α₃)(α₂ + α₄), and (α₁ + α₄)(α₂ + α₃). Each of these is equal to S₂ + S₃, S₁ + S₃, and S₁ + S₂ respectively.

But I don't know the values of these products yet. Maybe I can find another relation.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the squares of the sum of the roots. Let me compute (α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄)². That's equal to α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² + 2(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄). From Vieta, we know that α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2, so squaring that gives 4. And the sum of the products is 0, so 4 = sum of squares + 2*0, so sum of squares is 4. So α₁² + α₂² + α₃² + α₄² = 4.

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the expression (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃). That would be the product S₁S₂S₃. Maybe I can compute that.

But that seems complicated. Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the elementary symmetric sums of S₁, S₂, S₃.

Let me denote S₁, S₂, S₃ as the three expressions we need. Then, the elementary symmetric sums would be:

- Sum: S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0 (as we found earlier)
- Sum of products: S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃
- Product: S₁S₂S₃

If I can find these, then I can write a cubic equation whose roots are S₁, S₂, S₃, and then solve it.

So, let's try to compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃.

First, let's compute S₁S₂:

S₁S₂ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)

Let me expand this:

= α₁α₂α₁α₃ + α₁α₂α₂α₄ + α₃α₄α₁α₃ + α₃α₄α₂α₄

Simplify each term:

= α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²

Hmm, that's a bit messy. Maybe I can factor it differently.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Wait, let me think. Let me denote S = S₁ + S₂ + S₃ = 0, P = S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃, and Q = S₁S₂S₃.

I need to find P and Q.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃ by considering the square of the sum of the products of roots two at a time.

Wait, let me think about the square of the sum of the products two at a time. That is, (α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)². But we know this sum is 0, so its square is 0. Let me expand that:

(α₁α₂ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₄ + α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)² = 0

Expanding this, we get the sum of squares of each term plus twice the sum of the products of each pair of distinct terms.

So, that would be:

(α₁α₂)² + (α₁α₃)² + (α₁α₄)² + (α₂α₃)² + (α₂α₄)² + (α₃α₄)² + 2[α₁α₂α₁α₃ + α₁α₂α₁α₄ + α₁α₂α₂α₃ + ... and so on for all pairs]

Wait, that seems complicated, but maybe I can relate it to S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃.

Wait, let me think differently. Let me consider that S₁ = α₁α₂ + α₃α₄, S₂ = α₁α₃ + α₂α₄, S₃ = α₁α₄ + α₂α₃.

So, S₁S₂ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₃ + α₂α₄) = α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²

Similarly, S₁S₃ = (α₁α₂ + α₃α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃²α₄

And S₂S₃ = (α₁α₃ + α₂α₄)(α₁α₄ + α₂α₃) = α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄

So, if I add S₁S₂ + S₁S₃ + S₂S₃, I get:

[α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃α₄²] + [α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₁α₃α₄² + α₂α₃²α₄] + [α₁²α₃α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² + α₁α₂α₄² + α₂²α₃α₄]

Let me collect like terms:

- Terms with α₁²: α₁²α₂α₃ + α₁²α₂α₄ + α₁²α₃α₄ = α₁²(α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄)
- Terms with α₂²: α₁α₂²α₄ + α₁α₂²α₃ + α₂²α₃α₄ = α₂²(α₁α₄ + α₁α₃ + α₃α₄)
- Terms with α₃²: α₁α₃²α₄ + α₂α₃²α₄ + α₁α₂α₃² = α₃²(α₁α₄ + α₂α₄ + α₁α₂)
- Terms with α₄²: α₂α₃α₄² + α₁α₃α₄² + α₁α₂α₄² = α₄²(α₂α₃ + α₁α₃ + α₁α₂)

Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe I can factor these terms.

Wait, notice that α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ is equal to (α₂ + α₃ + α₄)(α₂ + α₃ + α₄) - (α₂² + α₃² + α₄²) - 2(α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄). Wait, no, that might not help.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express these in terms of the known symmetric sums.

Wait, let me recall that α₁ + α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2, so α₂ + α₃ + α₄ = -2 - α₁.

Similarly, α₁ + α₃ + α₄ = -2 - α₂, and so on.

So, for the term α₁²(α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄), we can write α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ as (α₂ + α₃ + α₄)(α₂ + α₃ + α₄) - (α₂² + α₃² + α₄²) - 2(α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄). Wait, that seems circular.

Alternatively, perhaps I can note that α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ is equal to (sum of products two at a time) minus α₁(α₂ + α₃ + α₄). From Vieta, the sum of products two at a time is 0, so α₂α₃ + α₂α₄ + α₃α₄ = 0 - α₁(-2 - α₁) = 2α","[2, '2']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],True
"First, I'll define the variables. Let \( p \) represent the cost of one pencil in cents, and \( e \) represent the cost of one jumbo eraser in cents.

From the problem, I can set up two equations based on the given information:
1. Three pencils and one eraser cost 124 cents: \( 3p + e = 124 \)
2. Five pencils and one eraser cost 182 cents: \( 5p + e = 182 \)

To find the cost of a pencil, I'll subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \( e \):
\( (5p + e) - (3p + e) = 182 - 124 \)

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. Let's say AB is the top side, BC is the right side, CD is the bottom, and DA is the left side. The center O is where the diagonals intersect, so it's the midpoint of both diagonals AC and BD.

Given that AB/AD = k, so AB is the length of the rectangle, and AD is the width. So, if I let AD = w, then AB = k*w. So, the rectangle has length k*w and width w. Maybe it's easier if I assign specific coordinates to the rectangle to make calculations easier.

Let me place the rectangle on a coordinate system with center O at (0,0). Then, the coordinates of the vertices would be: A at (-k*w/2, w/2), B at (k*w/2, w/2), C at (k*w/2, -w/2), and D at (-k*w/2, -w/2). Wait, actually, if AB is the length, then AB is horizontal, so the coordinates should be A(-a, b), B(a, b), C(a, -b), D(-a, -b), where 2a = AB and 2b = AD. So, AB = 2a, AD = 2b, so AB/AD = (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. So, a = k*b.

So, let me define the rectangle with vertices at (-k*b, b), (k*b, b), (k*b, -b), (-k*b, -b). So, the center O is at (0,0). Now, I need to find the region inside this rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D.

So, the set of points closer to O than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions closer to O than A, closer to O than B, closer to O than C, and closer to O than D. So, I need to find the locus of points where the distance to O is less than the distance to each of the four vertices.

Let me recall that the set of points equidistant to two points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. So, for each vertex, the region closer to O than to that vertex is the region on one side of the perpendicular bisector between O and that vertex.

So, for each vertex, say A, the perpendicular bisector between O and A will be a line, and the region closer to O than A is on one side of that line. Similarly, for B, C, D, we'll have similar lines, and the intersection of all these regions will be the area where points are closer to O than any vertex.

So, let me find the equations of these perpendicular bisectors.

First, let's find the perpendicular bisector between O(0,0) and A(-k*b, b). The midpoint between O and A is ((-k*b + 0)/2, (b + 0)/2) = (-k*b/2, b/2). The slope of OA is (b - 0)/(-k*b - 0) = -1/k. Therefore, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal, which is k.

So, the equation of the perpendicular bisector is y - b/2 = k(x + k*b/2). Let me write that out:

y - (b/2) = k*(x + (k*b)/2)

Simplify:

y = k*x + (k^2*b)/2 + b/2

Similarly, let's find the perpendicular bisector between O and B(k*b, b). The midpoint is (k*b/2, b/2). The slope of OB is (b - 0)/(k*b - 0) = 1/k. So, the perpendicular bisector will have a slope of -k.

Equation: y - b/2 = -k*(x - k*b/2)

Simplify:

y = -k*x + (k^2*b)/2 + b/2

Similarly, for vertex C(k*b, -b). Midpoint is (k*b/2, -b/2). Slope of OC is (-b - 0)/(k*b - 0) = -1/k. So, perpendicular bisector slope is k.

Equation: y + b/2 = k*(x - k*b/2)

Simplify:

y = k*x - (k^2*b)/2 - b/2

And for vertex D(-k*b, -b). Midpoint is (-k*b/2, -b/2). Slope of OD is (-b - 0)/(-k*b - 0) = 1/k. So, perpendicular bisector slope is -k.

Equation: y + b/2 = -k*(x + k*b/2)

Simplify:

y = -k*x - (k^2*b)/2 - b/2

So, now I have four lines:

1. From A: y = k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2
2. From B: y = -k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2
3. From C: y = k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2
4. From D: y = -k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

These four lines form a diamond (a rotated square) inside the rectangle. The region where all four inequalities hold (closer to O than any vertex) is the intersection of the regions below the first two lines and above the last two lines.

So, the area we're interested in is bounded by these four lines. Let me find the points where these lines intersect each other to determine the shape.

First, let's find the intersection of the first and second lines:

1. y = k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2
2. y = -k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2

Set them equal:

k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2 = -k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2

Simplify:

2k*x = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = (k^2*b + b)/2. So, the intersection point is (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2)

Similarly, intersection of first and fourth lines:

1. y = k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2
4. y = -k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

Set equal:

k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2 = -k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

2k*x = - (k^2*b + b)

x = - (k^2*b + b)/(2k) = -b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)

Then, plug into equation 1:

y = k*(-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)) + (k^2*b + b)/2

Simplify:

y = -b(k^2 + 1)/2 + (k^2*b + b)/2

= (-b(k^2 + 1) + b(k^2 + 1))/2 = 0

So, intersection point is (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)

Similarly, intersection of second and third lines:

2. y = -k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2
3. y = k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

Set equal:

-k*x + (k^2*b + b)/2 = k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

-2k*x = - (k^2*b + b)

x = (k^2*b + b)/(2k) = b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)

Then, plug into equation 2:

y = -k*(b(k^2 + 1)/(2k)) + (k^2*b + b)/2

Simplify:

y = -b(k^2 + 1)/2 + (k^2*b + b)/2 = 0

So, intersection point is (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)

Lastly, intersection of third and fourth lines:

3. y = k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2
4. y = -k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

Set equal:

k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2 = -k*x - (k^2*b + b)/2

Bring terms together:

2k*x = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = - (k^2*b + b)/2

So, intersection point is (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2)

So, now we have four intersection points:

1. (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2)
2. (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)
3. (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0)
4. (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2)

These four points form a diamond shape inside the rectangle. The diamond is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis.

Now, let's find the area of this diamond. Since it's a diamond (a rhombus), the area can be calculated as (d1*d2)/2, where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals.

Looking at the points, the vertical diagonal is from (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2) to (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2), so its length is (k^2 + 1)*b.

The horizontal diagonal is from (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0) to (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0), so its length is b(k^2 + 1)/k.

Therefore, the area of the diamond is:

Area = ( (k^2 + 1)*b * (b(k^2 + 1)/k) ) / 2 = ( (k^2 + 1)^2 * b^2 ) / (2k )

So, that's the area where points are closer to O than any vertex.

Now, the area of the rectangle is AB * AD = (2k*b) * (2b) = 4k*b^2.

Wait, hold on, earlier I defined AB = 2a = 2k*b and AD = 2b. So, area is AB * AD = (2k*b)*(2b) = 4k*b^2.

But wait, in my coordinate system, the rectangle goes from -k*b to k*b in the x-direction and from -b to b in the y-direction, so the width is 2k*b and the height is 2b, so area is indeed 4k*b^2.

So, the probability we're looking for is the area of the diamond divided by the area of the rectangle.

Probability = [ ( (k^2 + 1)^2 * b^2 ) / (2k ) ] / (4k*b^2 ) = [ (k^2 + 1)^2 / (2k) ] / (4k ) = (k^2 + 1)^2 / (8k^2 )

Wait, let me check that calculation again.

Area of diamond: ( (k^2 + 1)*b ) * ( b(k^2 + 1)/k ) / 2 = ( (k^2 + 1)^2 * b^2 ) / (2k )

Area of rectangle: 4k*b^2

So, probability is ( (k^2 + 1)^2 / (2k ) ) / (4k ) = (k^2 + 1)^2 / (8k^2 )

Wait, that seems correct.

But let me think again. Is the diamond entirely inside the rectangle? Because if the diamond extends beyond the rectangle, then the area we calculated would be incorrect.

Looking at the intersection points, the diamond's vertices are at (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2), (-b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0), (b(k^2 + 1)/(2k), 0), and (0, - (k^2 + 1)*b/2). So, we need to ensure that these points lie within the rectangle.

The rectangle extends from x = -k*b to x = k*b and y = -b to y = b.

So, let's check the x-coordinate of the horizontal vertices: ±b(k^2 + 1)/(2k). Is this less than or equal to k*b?

So, b(k^2 + 1)/(2k) ≤ k*b ?

Divide both sides by b (assuming b > 0):

(k^2 + 1)/(2k) ≤ k

Multiply both sides by 2k (positive, so inequality remains same):

k^2 + 1 ≤ 2k^2

Which simplifies to 1 ≤ k^2, so k ≥ 1.

Similarly, the y-coordinate of the vertical vertices is ±(k^2 + 1)*b/2. Is this less than or equal to b?

So, (k^2 + 1)/2 ≤ 1 ?

Which would require k^2 + 1 ≤ 2 => k^2 ≤ 1 => |k| ≤ 1.

But k is the ratio AB/AD, which is positive, so k > 0. So, if k ≤ 1, then the diamond's vertical vertices are within the rectangle, but if k > 1, then the vertical vertices would be outside the rectangle.

Similarly, for the horizontal vertices, if k ≥ 1, then the horizontal vertices are within the rectangle, but if k < 1, they might be outside.

Wait, this is a problem. So, depending on the value of k, the diamond may extend beyond the rectangle, meaning that the region where points are closer to O than any vertex is not the entire diamond but only the part that lies within the rectangle.

Hmm, so I need to consider two cases: when k ≤ 1 and when k > 1.

Wait, but in the problem statement, it's just a rectangle, so k can be any positive real number. So, perhaps I need to adjust my approach.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the diamond is entirely within the rectangle. Let me think again.

Wait, in the coordinate system, the rectangle goes from x = -k*b to x = k*b and y = -b to y = b. The diamond's vertices are at (0, (k^2 + 1)*b/2),","[1, '1']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True

Linda earned \$27.47, Sherry earned \$35.23, June earned \$37.37, and Connie earned \$26.52. Adding these together:

"Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². But since ω³ = 1, and we're dealing with complex numbers, ω can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined (since 1 + 1 = 2, which is fine, but wait, actually, if ω is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) would be 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But maybe ω is not 1? Let me check.

Wait, the problem says ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. So ω could be 1, but in that case, the expression would be 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I think the problem is more interesting if ω is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1. So maybe I should consider ω and ω², which are the non-real cube roots of unity.

I recall that for cube roots of unity, 1 + ω + ω² = 0. That's a key identity. Maybe I can use that to simplify the expression.

Let me write down the expression again: 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). I need to compute this sum.

To add these two fractions, I can find a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²). So the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Expanding this, we get 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω². Simplifying each term:

1*1 = 1

1*ω² = ω²

ω*1 = ω

ω*ω² = ω³. But since ω³ = 1, this term is 1.

So adding all these up: 1 + ω² + ω + 1 = (1 + 1) + (ω + ω²) = 2 + (ω + ω²).

But from the identity 1 + ω + ω² = 0, we know that ω + ω² = -1. So substituting that in, the denominator becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.

So the common denominator is 1. That's interesting.

Now, let's compute the numerator. The numerator is (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω). Wait, no, when adding fractions, the numerator is (1*(1 + ω²) + 1*(1 + ω)). So that's (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².

Again, using the identity ω + ω² = -1, this becomes 2 + (-1) = 1.

So the entire expression is numerator/denominator = 1/1 = 1.

Wait, so does that mean the expression is always 1? But hold on, if ω is 1, then the expression is 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 as well. So regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, the expression evaluates to 1.

But wait, let me double-check. If ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive cube root, say ω = e^(2πi/3), then 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) should also be 1. Let me compute it numerically to confirm.

Let me compute ω = e^(2πi/3) ≈ cos(120°) + i sin(120°) ≈ -1/2 + i√3/2. Then 1 + ω ≈ 1 - 1/2 + i√3/2 = 1/2 + i√3/2. The reciprocal of this is (1/2 - i√3/2)/( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Similarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) ≈ cos(240°) + i sin(240°) ≈ -1/2 - i√3/2. Then 1 + ω² ≈ 1 - 1/2 - i√3/2 = 1/2 - i√3/2. The reciprocal is (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Adding these two reciprocals: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1. So yes, it does equal 1.

Therefore, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression evaluates to 1.

Wait, but the problem says ""find all possible values."" So is 1 the only possible value? It seems so because whether ω is 1 or a primitive root, the expression is 1. So the only possible value is 1.

But let me think again. If ω is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive root, we just saw it's also 1. So yeah, the expression is always 1.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this algebraically without plugging in specific values.

Given that ω³ = 1, so ω ≠ 1 implies ω² + ω + 1 = 0. So ω² = -ω -1.

Let me substitute ω² in the expression:

1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + (-ω -1)) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(-ω).

Simplify the second term: 1/(-ω) = -1/ω.

So the expression becomes 1/(1 + ω) - 1/ω.

Let me combine these two terms:

[1/(1 + ω)] - [1/ω] = [ω - (1 + ω)] / [ω(1 + ω)] = [ω -1 - ω] / [ω(1 + ω)] = (-1)/[ω(1 + ω)].

So now, the expression simplifies to -1/[ω(1 + ω)].

Hmm, let's compute ω(1 + ω). That's ω + ω². But from the identity, ω + ω² = -1. So ω(1 + ω) = -1.

Therefore, the expression becomes -1/(-1) = 1.

So that's another way to see it. So regardless of the value of ω (as long as ω³ = 1 and ω ≠ -1, but wait, ω³ =1, so ω can't be -1 unless ω² =1, but ω² is also a root. Wait, no, ω³=1, so ω can be 1, ω, or ω². So in all cases, the expression is 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

Wait, but let me check if ω = -1 is a possibility. If ω = -1, then ω³ = (-1)^3 = -1 ≠ 1. So ω can't be -1. So all cube roots of unity are 1, ω, ω², and none of them are -1. So the expression is always 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

**Final Answer**

</think>

Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we need to find all possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we note that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are 1, \(\omega\), and \(\omega^2\), and they satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\).

To simplify the given expression, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]
The common denominator is \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). Expanding this, we get:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3
\]
Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), this simplifies to:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + (\omega + \omega^2) = 2 - 1 = 1
\]
Thus, the common denominator is 1.

Next, we compute the numerator:
\[
1 \cdot (1 + \omega^2) + 1 \cdot (1 + \omega) = 1 + \omega^2 + 1 + \omega = 2 + (\omega + \omega^2) = 2 - 1 = 1
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

We also verified this result by considering specific values of \(\omega\) and using algebraic manipulation, confirming that the expression always evaluates to 1.

Thus, the only possible value is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest distance that can be traveled if I start at any point A, B, C, or D, and visit the other three points once. The points are connected by lines with specific distances given. Let me try to visualize the diagram first based on the Asymptote code provided.

From the Asymptote code, I can see that the points are A, B, C, D with coordinates:
- A at (-3,3)
- B at (3,0)
- C at (0,-4)
- D at (0,0)

The connections and their distances are:
- D to B: 3 units
- A to B: 6 units
- A to C: 6 units
- D to C: 4 units
- A to D: 5 units
- C to B: 5 units

So, the connections form a graph where each point is connected to the others with specific edge weights. Let me try to sketch this mentally.

Point D is at the origin (0,0). A is at (-3,3), which is northwest of D. B is at (3,0), which is east of D. C is at (0,-4), which is south of D.

Looking at the connections:
- D is connected to B (3 units), A (5 units), and C (4 units).
- A is connected to B (6 units), C (6 units), and D (5 units).
- B is connected to C (5 units), D (3 units), and A (6 units).
- C is connected to A (6 units), D (4 units), and B (5 units).

So, it's a complete graph with four nodes, each connected to the other three, but with different edge weights.

The problem is asking for the shortest possible route that starts at any point and visits the other three points once. So, it's essentially asking for the shortest Hamiltonian path in this graph. A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once.

Since it's a complete graph with four nodes, the number of possible paths is 4! = 24. But since we can start at any point, we can fix a starting point and then consider permutations of the remaining three points. However, since the graph is undirected, some paths might be equivalent in terms of distance but different in direction.

But instead of enumerating all 24 paths, maybe I can find a smarter way. Let me list all possible permutations starting from each point and calculate their total distances.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, maybe I can find the shortest path by considering the distances between each pair and trying to find the minimal sum.

Let me list all the possible paths and their total distances.

First, let's fix starting point A.

From A, we can go to B, C, or D.

1. A -> B -> C -> D
   - A to B: 6
   - B to C: 5
   - C to D: 4
   Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

2. A -> B -> D -> C
   - A to B: 6
   - B to D: 3
   - D to C: 4
   Total: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13

3. A -> C -> B -> D
   - A to C: 6
   - C to B: 5
   - B to D: 3
   Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

4. A -> C -> D -> B
   - A to C: 6
   - C to D: 4
   - D to B: 3
   Total: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13

5. A -> D -> B -> C
   - A to D: 5
   - D to B: 3
   - B to C: 5
   Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

6. A -> D -> C -> B
   - A to D: 5
   - D to C: 4
   - C to B: 5
   Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

So, starting from A, the minimal distance is 13, achieved by paths A->B->D->C and A->C->D->B and A->D->B->C.

Now, let's fix starting point B.

From B, we can go to A, C, or D.

1. B -> A -> C -> D
   - B to A: 6
   - A to C: 6
   - C to D: 4
   Total: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16

2. B -> A -> D -> C
   - B to A: 6
   - A to D: 5
   - D to C: 4
   Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

3. B -> C -> A -> D
   - B to C: 5
   - C to A: 6
   - A to D: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

4. B -> C -> D -> A
   - B to C: 5
   - C to D: 4
   - D to A: 5
   Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

5. B -> D -> A -> C
   - B to D: 3
   - D to A: 5
   - A to C: 6
   Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

6. B -> D -> C -> A
   - B to D: 3
   - D to C: 4
   - C to A: 6
   Total: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

So, starting from B, the minimal distance is 13, achieved by paths B->D->C->A and B->D->C->A (wait, that's the same as above). Wait, no, let me check:

Wait, in the last path, B->D->C->A: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13. So that's another path with total 13.

So, starting from B, minimal is 13.

Now, starting from C.

From C, we can go to A, B, or D.

1. C -> A -> B -> D
   - C to A: 6
   - A to B: 6
   - B to D: 3
   Total: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15

2. C -> A -> D -> B
   - C to A: 6
   - A to D: 5
   - D to B: 3
   Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

3. C -> B -> A -> D
   - C to B: 5
   - B to A: 6
   - A to D: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

4. C -> B -> D -> A
   - C to B: 5
   - B to D: 3
   - D to A: 5
   Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

5. C -> D -> A -> B
   - C to D: 4
   - D to A: 5
   - A to B: 6
   Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

6. C -> D -> B -> A
   - C to D: 4
   - D to B: 3
   - B to A: 6
   Total: 4 + 3 + 6 = 13

So, starting from C, the minimal distance is 13, achieved by paths C->B->D->A and C->D->B->A.

Now, starting from D.

From D, we can go to A, B, or C.

1. D -> A -> B -> C
   - D to A: 5
   - A to B: 6
   - B to C: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

2. D -> A -> C -> B
   - D to A: 5
   - A to C: 6
   - C to B: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

3. D -> B -> A -> C
   - D to B: 3
   - B to A: 6
   - A to C: 6
   Total: 3 + 6 + 6 = 15

4. D -> B -> C -> A
   - D to B: 3
   - B to C: 5
   - C to A: 6
   Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

5. D -> C -> A -> B
   - D to C: 4
   - C to A: 6
   - A to B: 6
   Total: 4 + 6 + 6 = 16

6. D -> C -> B -> A
   - D to C: 4
   - C to B: 5
   - B to A: 6
   Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

So, starting from D, the minimal distance is 14, achieved by paths D->B->C->A and D->C->B->A.

Wait, but earlier, starting from A, B, and C, we had minimal distances of 13, but starting from D, the minimal is 14. So, the overall minimal is 13.

But let me double-check if I missed any paths or miscalculated.

Looking back:

From A, the minimal was 13.

From B, the minimal was 13.

From C, the minimal was 13.

From D, the minimal was 14.

So, the overall minimal is 13.

But let me check if there's a path that starts at D but goes through other points with a shorter distance.

Wait, in the starting from D, the minimal was 14, but is there a way to get 13? Let me see.

Wait, if I start at D, go to B (3), then to C (5), then to A (6). That's 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Alternatively, D to C (4), then C to B (5), then B to A (6). That's 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Alternatively, D to A (5), then A to B (6), then B to C (5). That's 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

So, no, starting from D, the minimal is 14.

Therefore, the minimal overall is 13.

But let me think again: is 13 the minimal? Or is there a way to get a shorter path?

Wait, let me think about the connections.

Looking at the graph, the edges have weights:

A-B:6, A-C:6, A-D:5

B-C:5, B-D:3

C-D:4

So, the edges with the smallest weights are B-D:3, C-D:4, A-D:5, B-C:5, A-B:6, A-C:6.

So, the smallest edges are 3,4,5,5,6,6.

So, to minimize the total distance, we should try to use the smallest edges as much as possible.

But since it's a path, we can't reuse edges, so we need to find a path that uses the smallest possible edges without overlapping.

So, perhaps starting from B, going to D (3), then to C (4), then to A (6). That's 3+4+6=13.

Alternatively, starting from C, going to D (4), then to B (3), then to A (6). That's 4+3+6=13.

Similarly, starting from A, going to D (5), then to B (3), then to C (5). That's 5+3+5=13.

So, all these paths give 13.

Is there a way to get lower than 13? Let's see.

If we try to use the two smallest edges: 3 and 4.

But to connect them, we need to see if they can be part of the same path.

For example, B-D (3) and C-D (4). But to connect B-D and C-D, we need to go through D, but then we have to go from D to another point, which would be A (5). So, that's 3 + 4 + 5 = 12? Wait, no, because we have to traverse three edges for four points.

Wait, no, the path has three edges. So, if we can traverse B-D (3), D-C (4), and then C-A (6). That's 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

Alternatively, if we can find a path that uses edges 3,4, and something smaller than 6, but the next smallest edge is 5.

Wait, is there a way to use 3,4, and 5?

For example, B-D (3), D-C (4), C-B (5). But that would be a cycle, not a path.

Alternatively, B-D (3), D-A (5), A-C (6). That's 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Alternatively, C-D (4), D-B (3), B-A (6). That's 4 + 3 + 6 = 13.

So, seems like 13 is the minimal.

Wait, another thought: is there a way to traverse B-D (3), D-A (5), and A-C (6). That's 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Alternatively, C-D (4), D-A (5), A-B (6). That's 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

So, no, 13 is the minimal.

Wait, another approach: Let's consider all possible paths and their total distances.

But since we've already considered all starting points and found that the minimal is 13, I think 13 is the answer.

But just to be thorough, let me list all possible paths and their totals.

Wait, but that would be 24 paths, which is time-consuming, but maybe I can find if any path has a total less than 13.

Looking at the edges, the smallest three edges are 3,","[3, '3']",13,"[13, '13']",True
