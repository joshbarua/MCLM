"Alright, so I've got this problem here with a right triangle, and I need to find the length of DE. The problem says that sin D is 0.7, and there's an Asymptote figure provided. Let me try to visualize it first. 

From the Asymptote code, it looks like the triangle is DEF, with a right angle at E. So, points D, E, and F form a right-angled triangle with the right angle at E. The coordinates given are F at (0,0), E at (0,7), and D at (sqrt(51),7). So, plotting these points, F is the origin, E is straight up along the y-axis 7 units, and D is somewhere in the first quadrant, 7 units up along the y-axis and sqrt(51) units along the x-axis. 

Wait, hold on. If E is at (0,7) and F is at (0,0), then EF is a vertical line of length 7. D is at (sqrt(51),7), so DE is a horizontal line from E to D, right? Because both E and D have the same y-coordinate, 7. So DE is just the horizontal distance between E and D, which is sqrt(51) units. But the problem is asking for DE, and it's given that sin D is 0.7. Hmm, maybe I need to verify this.

Let me think about the triangle DEF. Since it's a right-angled triangle at E, the sides are DE, EF, and DF. DE is one leg, EF is the other leg, and DF is the hypotenuse. So, in triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, which is opposite to side EF and adjacent to side DE. 

Wait, no. In a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is opposite over hypotenuse. So, sin D would be the length of the side opposite to angle D divided by the hypotenuse. In this case, angle D is at point D, so the side opposite to angle D is EF, which is 7 units. The hypotenuse is DF. So, sin D = EF / DF = 7 / DF = 0.7.

So, if sin D = 0.7, then 7 / DF = 0.7. Let me solve for DF. 

7 / DF = 0.7  
=> DF = 7 / 0.7  
=> DF = 10.

So, the hypotenuse DF is 10 units long. Now, since we have a right-angled triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So,

DF² = DE² + EF²  
10² = DE² + 7²  
100 = DE² + 49  
DE² = 100 - 49  
DE² = 51  
DE = sqrt(51).

Wait, that's exactly what the coordinates suggested earlier. So, DE is sqrt(51). But let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes here.

Let me recap. The triangle is right-angled at E, so angle E is 90 degrees. Angle D is one of the other angles, and we're given sin D = 0.7. The side opposite to angle D is EF, which is 7 units. So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = 7 / DF = 0.7. Solving for DF gives DF = 10. Then, using Pythagoras, DE² + 7² = 10², so DE² = 100 - 49 = 51, hence DE = sqrt(51). 

That seems consistent. So, DE is sqrt(51). But just to double-check, let me think about the coordinates again. Point D is at (sqrt(51),7), and point E is at (0,7). So, the distance between D and E is just the difference in the x-coordinates since the y-coordinates are the same. So, DE = sqrt(51) - 0 = sqrt(51). Yep, that matches.

Alternatively, if I consider the triangle DEF, with right angle at E, then DE is one leg, EF is the other leg, and DF is the hypotenuse. We found DF to be 10, EF is 7, so DE must be sqrt(10² - 7²) = sqrt(100 - 49) = sqrt(51). 

I think that's solid. So, DE is sqrt(51). 

But wait, just to make sure I didn't confuse any sides. In triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, so the sides relative to angle D are: opposite side is EF, adjacent side is DE, and hypotenuse is DF. So, sin D = opposite / hypotenuse = EF / DF = 7 / DF = 0.7. So, DF = 10. Then, using Pythagoras, DE = sqrt(DF² - EF²) = sqrt(100 - 49) = sqrt(51). Yep, that's correct.

I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. So, I'm confident that DE is sqrt(51).

**Final Answer**
The length of DE is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we need to find the length of DE. We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\).

1. In triangle DEF, angle D is at point D, so the side opposite to angle D is EF, which is 7 units.
2. The sine of angle D is given by:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
   \]
3. Solving for the hypotenuse DF:
   \[
   \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7 \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]
4. Using the Pythagorean theorem to find DE:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2 \implies 10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}
   \]

Thus, the length of DE is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is obtained by rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the clockwise direction. Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I remember that rotating a complex number around another complex number involves a few steps. I think it's something like translating the complex plane so that the center of rotation becomes the origin, then performing the rotation, and then translating back. Let me confirm that.

So, if I have a point \( z \) and I want to rotate it around a point \( c \), the process should be:

1. Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \) to move the center \( c \) to the origin.
2. Apply the rotation to the translated point.
3. Translate back by adding \( c \) to the rotated point.

Yes, that makes sense. So, mathematically, this would be:

\( w = c + e^{-i\theta}(z - c) \)

Where \( \theta \) is the angle of rotation. Since it's clockwise, the angle is negative, which is why it's \( e^{-i\theta} \). In this case, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so the rotation factor is \( e^{-i\pi/4} \).

Let me write that down:

\( w = c + e^{-i\pi/4}(z - c) \)

Okay, so I need to compute \( z - c \) first. Let's compute that.

Given:
\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)
\( c = 2 - 3i \)

So, subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):

\( z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) ] \)

Simplify the real part:

\( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

Simplify the imaginary part:

\( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = (-3\sqrt{2})i \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)

Hmm, that seems right. Let me double-check:

Real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \) ✔️

Imaginary part: \( -3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3 = -3\sqrt{2} \) ✔️

Okay, so \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Now, I need to multiply this by \( e^{-i\pi/4} \).

I remember that \( e^{-i\theta} = \cos\theta - i\sin\theta \). So, for \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):

\( e^{-i\pi/4} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) \)

We know that \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). So,

\( e^{-i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

So, now, I need to compute:

\( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Let me denote \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = -3\sqrt{2} \) for simplicity. So, the expression becomes:

\( (a + b i) \times \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \)

Multiplying this out:

First, multiply \( a \) with each term:

\( a \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

\( a \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = \sqrt{2} \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = -i \times \frac{2}{2} = -i \)

Next, multiply \( b i \) with each term:

\( b i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3\sqrt{2})i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (-3 \times 2 / 2)i = -3i \)

\( b i \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = (-3\sqrt{2})i \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \)

Let me compute this term carefully:

First, multiply the constants:

\( (-3\sqrt{2}) \times (-\sqrt{2}/2) = (3 \times 2)/2 = 3 \)

Then, multiply the imaginary units:

\( i \times i = i^2 = -1 \)

So, the entire term is \( 3 \times (-1) = -3 \)

Putting it all together:

1. From \( a \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \): 1
2. From \( a \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \): -i
3. From \( b i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \): -3i
4. From \( b i \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \): -3

So, adding all these together:

Real parts: 1 - 3 = -2

Imaginary parts: -i - 3i = -4i

Therefore, the product is \( -2 - 4i \)

Wait, let me double-check the multiplication:

Wait, when I multiplied \( b i \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \), I think I might have made a mistake.

Let me recompute that term:

\( (-3\sqrt{2})i \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \)

Multiply the constants:

\( (-3\sqrt{2}) \times (-\sqrt{2}/2) = (3 \times 2)/2 = 3 \)

Multiply the imaginary units:

\( i \times i = i^2 = -1 \)

So, the term is \( 3 \times (-1) = -3 \). Hmm, that seems correct.

So, the total is 1 - i - 3i - 3 = (1 - 3) + (-i - 3i) = -2 - 4i. Okay, that seems correct.

So, \( e^{-i\pi/4}(z - c) = -2 - 4i \)

Now, we need to add \( c \) back to this result to get \( w \).

Given that \( c = 2 - 3i \), so:

\( w = (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) \)

Compute the real parts: -2 + 2 = 0

Compute the imaginary parts: -4i - 3i = -7i

So, \( w = 0 - 7i = -7i \)

Wait, that seems too simple. Let me verify each step again.

First, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Correct.

Then, \( e^{-i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Correct.

Multiplying \( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \):

Let me compute this multiplication again without substitution.

First, expand the product:

\( \sqrt{2} \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

\( \sqrt{2} \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = -i \times \frac{2}{2} = -i \)

\( -3\sqrt{2}i \times \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \times \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

\( -3\sqrt{2}i \times (-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 3 \times \frac{2}{2} \times i^2 = 3 \times 1 \times (-1) = -3 \)

So, adding all terms: 1 - i - 3i - 3 = (1 - 3) + (-i - 3i) = -2 - 4i. Correct.

Then, adding \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = ( -2 + 2 ) + ( -4i - 3i ) = 0 - 7i \). So, \( w = -7i \).

Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again: rotating a complex number around another point... is it possible that the result is purely imaginary? Maybe, depending on the rotation.

Alternatively, perhaps I made a mistake in the direction of rotation. The problem says ""clockwise"" which is a negative angle, so \( e^{-i\pi/4} \) is correct. If it were counterclockwise, it would be \( e^{i\pi/4} \). So, that part is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the multiplication. Let me try another approach: represent \( z - c \) as a vector and perform the rotation using rotation matrix.

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). In vector form, that's \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \).

A rotation by \( \theta \) clockwise is equivalent to multiplying by the rotation matrix:

\( \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta & \sin\theta \\ -\sin\theta & \cos\theta \end{pmatrix} \)

For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), \( \cos\theta = \sin\theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). So, the rotation matrix is:

\( \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \)

Multiplying this matrix by the vector \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \):

First component:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Compute each term:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-3 \times 2}{2} = -3 \)

So, first component: 1 - 3 = -2

Second component:

\( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Compute each term:

\( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times \sqrt{2} = -\frac{2}{2} = -1 \)

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \times (-3\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-3 \times 2}{2} = -3 \)

So, second component: -1 - 3 = -4

Therefore, the rotated vector is \( (-2, -4) \), which corresponds to the complex number \( -2 - 4i \). Then, adding back \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = 0 - 7i \). So, same result.

Hmm, so both methods give me \( w = -7i \). That seems consistent.

Wait, but let me think about the geometry. The original point \( z \) is \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \). So, in coordinates, that's \( (2 + \sqrt{2}, -3 - 3\sqrt{2}) \). The center \( c \) is \( (2, -3) \). So, the vector from \( c \) to \( z \) is \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \), which is what I had earlier.

Rotating this vector by \( \pi/4 \) clockwise should bring it to a new position. The result was \( (-2, -4) \), which when added to \( c \) gives \( (0, -7) \), which is \( -7i \). That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can visualize this. The original vector from \( c \) to \( z \) is \( (\sqrt{2}, -3\sqrt{2}) \). The length of this vector is \( \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \). After rotation, the length should remain the same. Let's check the length of \( (-2, -4) \): \( \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \). So, the length is preserved, which is a good sign.

Also, the angle of the original vector: the slope is \( (-3\sqrt{2}) / \sqrt{2} = -3 \), so the angle is \( \arctan(-3) \). After rotating \( \pi/4 \) clockwise, the new angle should be \(","[pi/4, '\\pi/4']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
"To simplify the square root of 242, I start by factoring 242 into its prime components. I recognize that 242 is an even number, so it's divisible by 2. Dividing 242 by 2 gives me 121. Next, I factor 121, which is a perfect square since 11 multiplied by 11 equals 121. Therefore, the prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11 squared.

Now, I can express the square root of 242 as the square root of 2 multiplied by 11 squared. Using the property of square roots that allows me to separate the factors, I take the square root of 11 squared, which is 11, and leave the square root of 2 under the radical. This simplifies the expression to 11 times the square root of 2. Thus, the simplified form of the square root of 242 is 11√2.

To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), follow these steps:

1. **Factor 242 into its prime components:**
   
   \(242 = 2 \times 121\)

2. **Recognize that 121 is a perfect square:**
   
   \(121 = 11^2\)

3. **Rewrite the square root using these factors:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}

4. **Separate the square root into the product of the square roots:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{11^2} \times \sqrt{2}

5. **Simplify the square root of the perfect square:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{11^2} = 11

6. **Combine the results:**

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when you expand a binomial like \((a + b)^n\), you can use the binomial theorem, which involves combinations and powers of each term. 

First, let me recall the binomial theorem formula. It states that:
\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}
\]
where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient, which can be calculated as \(\frac{n!}{k!(n - k)!}\).

In this case, our binomial is \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), so \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). 

I need to find the term in the expansion that doesn't have any \(x\) in it, meaning the exponent of \(x\) is zero. So, each term in the expansion will look like:
\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
Let me simplify this term step by step.

First, let's compute the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{k}\). That's straightforward; it's just the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from 5, which is \(\frac{5!}{k!(5 - k)!}\).

Next, let's look at \((10x^3)^{5 - k}\). This can be broken down into \(10^{5 - k}\) and \(x^{3(5 - k)}\), which simplifies to \(10^{5 - k} x^{15 - 3k}\).

Then, we have \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\). This can be split into \((-1)^k\), \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\), and \(x^{-2k}\). So, putting it all together, this part becomes \((-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}\).

Now, combining all these parts, the general term becomes:
\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times (-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]
Simplifying the exponents of \(x\), we get \(x^{15 - 5k}\).

We want the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero because that's the constant term. So, we set up the equation:
\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]
So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\).

Now, let's compute the term when \(k = 3\):
1. Compute the binomial coefficient: \(\binom{5}{3}\). I know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \binom{5}{2}\) because of the symmetry property of combinations, and \(\binom{5}{2} = 10\).
2. Compute \(10^{5 - 3} = 10^2 = 100\).
3. Compute \((-1)^3 = -1\).
4. Compute \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\).

Now, multiply all these together along with the binomial coefficient:
\[
10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]
Let me compute this step by step:
- First, \(10 \times 100 = 1000\).
- Then, \(1000 \times (-1) = -1000\).
- Finally, \(-1000 \times \frac{1}{8} = -125\).

So, the constant term is \(-125\).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 

Starting with the binomial coefficient: \(\binom{5}{3}\) is indeed 10 because 5 choose 3 is 10. 

Then, \(10^{5 - 3}\) is \(10^2 = 100\). 

\((-1)^3\) is \(-1\), correct. 

\(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\) is \(\frac{1}{8}\), that's right.

Multiplying all together: 10 * 100 = 1000, 1000 * (-1) = -1000, -1000 * (1/8) = -125. Yep, that seems correct.

Just to be thorough, let me write out the entire expansion up to the term where \(k=3\) to see if it makes sense.

The expansion is:
\[
\sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]
So, for \(k=0\): \(\binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^5 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^0 = 1 \times 10^5 x^{15} \times 1 = 100000x^{15}\)

For \(k=1\): \(\binom{5}{1} (10x^3)^4 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^1 = 5 \times 10^4 x^{12} \times (-\frac{1}{2}x^{-2}) = 5 \times 10000 \times (-\frac{1}{2}) x^{10} = -25000x^{10}\)

For \(k=2\): \(\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = 10 \times 1000 x^9 \times \frac{1}{4}x^{-4} = 10 \times 1000 \times \frac{1}{4} x^{5} = 2500x^{5}\)

For \(k=3\): \(\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \times 100 x^6 \times (-\frac{1}{8})x^{-6} = 10 \times 100 \times (-\frac{1}{8}) x^{0} = -125\)

So, yes, the term when \(k=3\) is indeed \(-125\), which is the constant term. 

Just to make sure, let me check \(k=4\) and \(k=5\) as well, to see if they result in negative exponents or higher exponents, which they should.

For \(k=4\): \(\binom{5}{4} (10x^3)^1 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^4 = 5 \times 10x^3 \times \frac{1}{16}x^{-8} = 5 \times 10 \times \frac{1}{16} x^{-5} = \frac{50}{16}x^{-5} = \frac{25}{8}x^{-5}\)

For \(k=5\): \(\binom{5}{5} (10x^3)^0 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5 = 1 \times 1 \times (-\frac{1}{32})x^{-10} = -\frac{1}{32}x^{-10}\)

So, as expected, the terms for \(k=4\) and \(k=5\) have negative exponents, meaning they are not constant terms. Therefore, the only constant term is when \(k=3\), which is \(-125\).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and the expansion checks out. So, the constant term is definitely \(-125\).

**Final Answer**
The constant term is \boxed{-125}.
</think>

To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^{k}
\]

Here, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). Each term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying this term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times (-1)^k \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \times x^{15 - 5k}
\]

We need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero. Setting up the equation:

\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]

For \(k = 3\), the term is:

1. Binomial coefficient: \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\)
2. \(10^{5 - 3} = 100\)
3. \((-1)^3 = -1\)
4. \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}\)

Multiplying these together:

\[
10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = -125
\]

Thus, the constant term is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem here: If n is congruent to 2 modulo 7, which means n ≡ 2 mod 7, I need to find the remainder when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, since n ≡ 2 mod 7, that tells me that when n is divided by 7, the remainder is 2. So, n can be written as 7k + 2 for some integer k. Maybe substituting this into the expression will help. Let me try that.

So, substituting n = 7k + 2 into each term:

n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4

n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6

n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8

Wait, 7k + 8 can be simplified modulo 7. Since 8 divided by 7 is 1 with a remainder of 1, so 7k + 8 ≡ 7k + 1 mod 7, which simplifies to 1 mod 7 because 7k is a multiple of 7.

So now, the expression becomes:

(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) ≡ (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(1) mod 7

But since we're working modulo 7, any multiple of 7 will be congruent to 0. So, 7k + 4 ≡ 4 mod 7 and 7k + 6 ≡ 6 mod 7. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

4 * 6 * 1 mod 7

Calculating that: 4 * 6 is 24, and 24 * 1 is 24. Now, 24 divided by 7 is 3 with a remainder of 3, because 7*3=21 and 24-21=3. So, 24 mod 7 is 3.

Wait, let me double-check that. 4*6 is indeed 24, and 24 mod 7: 7*3=21, 24-21=3. Yep, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this without substituting n. Since n ≡ 2 mod 7, then:

n + 2 ≡ 2 + 2 = 4 mod 7

n + 4 ≡ 2 + 4 = 6 mod 7

n + 6 ≡ 2 + 6 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7

So, multiplying these together: 4 * 6 * 1 mod 7. Again, 4*6=24, 24 mod 7=3. So, same result.

Hmm, seems consistent. Maybe another way to think about it is to compute each term modulo 7 first, then multiply.

So, n ≡ 2 mod 7.

n + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7

n + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7

n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7

Multiplying: 4 * 6 = 24, 24 mod 7 is 3, then 3 * 1 = 3 mod 7.

Yep, same answer.

Wait, is there a way to factor this expression or use some modular arithmetic properties to make it easier? Let me see.

The expression is (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Maybe I can write this as (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6). Hmm, not sure if factoring helps here, but perhaps expanding it?

Let me try expanding it step by step.

First, multiply (n + 2)(n + 4):

= n^2 + 4n + 2n + 8

= n^2 + 6n + 8

Now, multiply this by (n + 6):

= (n^2 + 6n + 8)(n + 6)

= n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48

Combine like terms:

= n^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) + (36n + 8n) + 48

= n^3 + 12n^2 + 44n + 48

Hmm, now we have the expanded form. But since we're working modulo 7, maybe we can reduce each coefficient modulo 7.

Let's see:

n^3 mod 7 is just n^3, but since n ≡ 2 mod 7, n^3 ≡ 2^3 = 8 ≡ 1 mod 7.

12n^2 mod 7: 12 mod 7 is 5, so 5n^2. Since n ≡ 2, n^2 ≡ 4, so 5*4=20 ≡ 6 mod 7.

44n mod 7: 44 mod 7 is 2 (since 7*6=42, 44-42=2), so 2n. n ≡ 2, so 2*2=4 mod 7.

48 mod 7: 48 divided by 7 is 6*7=42, 48-42=6, so 48 ≡ 6 mod 7.

Now, adding all these up:

n^3 ≡ 1

12n^2 ≡ 6

44n ≡ 4

48 ≡ 6

So total is 1 + 6 + 4 + 6 = 17. 17 mod 7 is 3, because 7*2=14, 17-14=3.

So, same result again. So, whether I substitute n=7k+2, compute each term modulo 7, or expand the entire expression and then reduce modulo 7, I get the same remainder of 3.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make a mistake in expanding, let me check the expansion again.

(n + 2)(n + 4) = n^2 + 6n + 8. That's correct.

Then, multiplying by (n + 6):

n^2*(n + 6) = n^3 + 6n^2

6n*(n + 6) = 6n^2 + 36n

8*(n + 6) = 8n + 48

Adding all together:

n^3 + 6n^2 + 6n^2 + 36n + 8n + 48

Combine like terms:

n^3 + (6n^2 + 6n^2) = n^3 + 12n^2

(36n + 8n) = 44n

And +48.

Yes, that's correct. So, the expansion is correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the fact that modulo 7, certain numbers have inverses or properties that can simplify multiplication.

But in this case, since the numbers are small, it's straightforward to compute each term modulo 7 and then multiply.

So, n ≡ 2 mod 7.

n + 2 ≡ 4 mod 7

n + 4 ≡ 6 mod 7

n + 6 ≡ 1 mod 7

So, 4 * 6 = 24, 24 mod 7 is 3, then 3 * 1 = 3 mod 7.

Yep, that's the simplest way.

I think I've confirmed it multiple ways, so I'm confident the remainder is 3 when (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) is divided by 7, given that n ≡ 2 mod 7.
</think>

The remainder when $(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)$ is divided by 7 is $\boxed{3}$.","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"Alright, so I have this problem about a parallelogram with three given points and a fourth point (x, y) where x is greater than 7. I need to find the value of x + y. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a parallelogram, the opposite sides are equal and parallel. That means the midpoints of the diagonals should coincide. So, if I can find the midpoint of one diagonal, it should be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. That might help me find the missing point.

Let me list the given points: (5, 3), (6, 8), (7, 4), and (x, y). I need to figure out which points are connected as diagonals. Wait, in a parallelogram, the diagonals are the lines connecting opposite vertices. So, if I can pair the points correctly, I can find the midpoint.

But I'm not sure which points are connected. Maybe I should consider different pairings. Let's see, if I take (5,3) and (7,4) as one diagonal, then the midpoint would be the average of their coordinates. Similarly, the other diagonal would be between (6,8) and (x,y). Let me calculate that.

Midpoint formula is ((x1 + x2)/2, (y1 + y2)/2). So, midpoint between (5,3) and (7,4) is ((5+7)/2, (3+4)/2) = (12/2, 7/2) = (6, 3.5). 

Now, the midpoint of the other diagonal, which is between (6,8) and (x,y), should also be (6, 3.5). So, setting up the equations:

(6 + x)/2 = 6 and (8 + y)/2 = 3.5.

Solving the first equation: (6 + x)/2 = 6 => 6 + x = 12 => x = 6. But wait, the problem says x > 7, so x can't be 6. Hmm, that doesn't make sense. Maybe I paired the points incorrectly.

Let me try another pairing. Maybe (5,3) and (6,8) are one diagonal, and (7,4) and (x,y) are the other diagonal. Let's compute the midpoint for (5,3) and (6,8):

Midpoint = ((5+6)/2, (3+8)/2) = (11/2, 11/2) = (5.5, 5.5).

So, the midpoint of the other diagonal, which is (7,4) and (x,y), should also be (5.5, 5.5). Therefore:

(7 + x)/2 = 5.5 and (4 + y)/2 = 5.5.

Solving the first equation: 7 + x = 11 => x = 4. But again, x needs to be greater than 7, so this is not possible either. Hmm, maybe I need to try a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I should consider the properties of vectors in a parallelogram. In a parallelogram, the vector from one point to another should be equal to the vector from another point to the fourth point. So, if I take vectors between the given points, I can find the missing point.

Let me label the points as A(5,3), B(6,8), C(7,4), and D(x,y). In a parallelogram, the vector AB should be equal to the vector DC, and the vector AD should be equal to the vector BC.

First, let's find vector AB. Vector AB is B - A = (6-5, 8-3) = (1,5).

If AB equals DC, then vector DC should also be (1,5). Vector DC is C - D = (7 - x, 4 - y). So, setting this equal to (1,5):

7 - x = 1 => x = 6

4 - y = 5 => y = -1

But again, x = 6 is less than 7, which contradicts the condition x > 7. So, maybe this pairing is incorrect.

Alternatively, maybe vector AD equals vector BC. Let's try that.

Vector BC is C - B = (7 - 6, 4 - 8) = (1, -4).

So, vector AD should be equal to (1, -4). Vector AD is D - A = (x - 5, y - 3). Therefore:

x - 5 = 1 => x = 6

y - 3 = -4 => y = -1

Again, x = 6, which is not greater than 7. Hmm, this isn't working. Maybe I need to consider a different order of the points.

Perhaps the points are not in order. Maybe the parallelogram is A(5,3), B(6,8), D(7,4), and C(x,y). Let me try this arrangement.

In this case, vector AB is (1,5) as before. Vector DC should be equal to AB. Vector DC is C - D = (x - 7, y - 4). So:

x - 7 = 1 => x = 8

y - 4 = 5 => y = 9

So, x = 8 and y = 9. Since x = 8 > 7, this satisfies the condition. Therefore, the missing point is (8,9), and x + y = 8 + 9 = 17.

Wait, let me verify this. If the points are A(5,3), B(6,8), D(7,4), and C(8,9), then let's check the midpoints.

Midpoint of AC: ((5+8)/2, (3+9)/2) = (13/2, 12/2) = (6.5, 6)

Midpoint of BD: ((6+7)/2, (8+4)/2) = (13/2, 12/2) = (6.5, 6)

Yes, the midpoints coincide, so this must be correct. Therefore, x + y = 17.

"Alright, so I have this problem here about a right-angled triangle, ABC, where angle B is 90 degrees. They tell me that sin A equals 2 times cos A, and I need to find tan A. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that in a right-angled triangle, the sine and cosine of an angle are related to the sides. Specifically, for angle A, sin A is the opposite side over the hypotenuse, and cos A is the adjacent side over the hypotenuse. So, if I let the sides opposite, adjacent, and hypotenuse to angle A be a, b, and c respectively, then:

sin A = a/c  
cos A = b/c

Given that sin A = 2 cos A, I can substitute the expressions I just wrote:

a/c = 2*(b/c)

Hmm, okay, so if I multiply both sides by c, I get:

a = 2b

That's interesting. So the side opposite angle A is twice the side adjacent to angle A. That gives me a ratio between the sides. Maybe I can assign some variable to these sides to make it easier. Let's say the adjacent side is x, so the opposite side would be 2x. Then, using the Pythagorean theorem, I can find the hypotenuse.

So, the hypotenuse squared is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides:

c² = a² + b²  
c² = (2x)² + x²  
c² = 4x² + x²  
c² = 5x²  
c = sqrt(5x²)  
c = x*sqrt(5)

Okay, so the hypotenuse is x times the square root of 5. Now, I need to find tan A. I remember that tan A is the opposite side over the adjacent side, which in this case is a/b.

From earlier, I have a = 2x and b = x, so:

tan A = a/b = 2x / x = 2

Wait, that seems straightforward. So tan A is 2. Let me just double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I started by expressing sin A and cos A in terms of the sides of the triangle.
2. Substituted the given equation sin A = 2 cos A, leading to a = 2b.
3. Assigned variables to the sides: adjacent = x, opposite = 2x.
4. Applied the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse, which came out to x√5.
5. Calculated tan A as opposite over adjacent, which is 2x/x = 2.

Everything seems to check out. I don't see any errors in my reasoning. So, I think tan A is indeed 2.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\tan A$ is \boxed{2}.
</think>

Given a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

First, we express \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\) in terms of the sides of the triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{a}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{b}{c}
\]
where \(a\) is the side opposite angle \(A\), \(b\) is the side adjacent to angle \(A\), and \(c\) is the hypotenuse.

Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we substitute the expressions:
\[
\frac{a}{c} = 2 \left(\frac{b}{c}\right)
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(c\) gives:
\[
a = 2b
\]

Let the adjacent side \(b = x\). Then the opposite side \(a = 2x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse \(c\):
\[
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 = (2x)^2 + x^2 = 4x^2 + x^2 = 5x^2
\]
\[
c = x\sqrt{5}
\]

Now, we calculate \(\tan A\), which is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:
\[
\tan A = \frac{a}{b} = \frac{2x}{x} = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \(\tan A\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Alright, so I have this function here: f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). I need to find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote, and then add them up as a + b + c. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes, that works. So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the denominator is zero when x = -2 or x = 7. Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a and b are -2 and 7. I should note that the numerator at x = -2 is 2*(-2) = -4, which isn't zero, and at x = 7 is 2*7 = 14, also not zero. So, both are indeed vertical asymptotes.

Now, moving on to the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² - 5x -14, which is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c is 0.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. If they're equal, it's the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree is higher, there's an oblique asymptote. So, in this case, since 1 < 2, it's y = 0. That seems right.

So, putting it all together, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7, and the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. Therefore, a = -2, b = 7, c = 0. Adding them up: a + b + c = (-2) + 7 + 0 = 5.

Wait, hold on, is that correct? Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in factoring the denominator. x² -5x -14. Let me expand (x + 2)(x - 7) to check: x² -7x + 2x -14 = x² -5x -14. Yes, that's correct. So, the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x = -2 and x = 7.

And for the horizontal asymptote, since the denominator's degree is higher, it's y = 0. So, c is 0. So, adding them: -2 + 7 + 0 = 5. That seems right.

I think I'm confident with that answer. So, the sum a + b + c is 5.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b + c\) is \boxed{5}.

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7) \]

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which are at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). Thus, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

For the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1 and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( c = 0 \).

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \]

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for all two-dimensional vectors \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, okay. I remember that this has something to do with the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, right? It's the maximum value of \( \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \) over all non-zero vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). So, essentially, I need to find the maximum value of this ratio, which will be my \( C \).

Let me write down the matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, for any vector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), the product \( A\mathbf{v} \) is:

\[
A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ 0x - 2y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}
\]

The norm of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is then:

\[
\|A\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2}
\]

And the norm of \( \mathbf{v} \) is:

\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

So, the ratio \( \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} \) is:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + ( -2y)^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
\]

I need to find the maximum value of this expression. Hmm, this seems like an optimization problem. Maybe I can use calculus or some method involving eigenvalues. Wait, I think the operator norm is related to the singular values of the matrix. The operator norm is the largest singular value of the matrix.

Right, so to find the operator norm, I need to compute the singular values of \( A \). The singular values are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). Let me compute \( A^T A \).

First, the transpose of \( A \) is:

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Multiplying \( A^T \) and \( A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me compute each element:

- First row, first column: \( 2*2 + 0*0 = 4 \)
- First row, second column: \( 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6 \)
- Second row, first column: \( 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6 \)
- Second row, second column: \( 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So,

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix. The eigenvalues \( \lambda \) satisfy the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

So,

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = 0
\]

Calculating the determinant:

\[
(4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = 0
\]

Expanding this:

\[
(4)(13) - 4\lambda - 13\lambda + \lambda^2 - 36 = 0
\]
\[
52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2 - 36 = 0
\]
\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

So, the quadratic equation is \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \). Let me solve for \( \lambda \):

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4*1*16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, the eigenvalues are:

- \( \lambda_1 = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
- \( \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Therefore, the singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, which are \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \) and \( \sqrt{1} = 1 \).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the largest singular value, which is 4. So, the smallest \( C \) that satisfies the inequality is 4.

Wait, let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in computing \( A^T A \). Let me recalculate:

\( A^T A \) is:

First row: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4, 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6

Second row: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6, 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13

Yes, that's correct. So, the eigenvalues are 16 and 1, so singular values 4 and 1. So, the operator norm is 4.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using the ratio expression. Let me denote \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), then:

\[
\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|^2}{\|\mathbf{v}\|^2} = \frac{(2x + 3y)^2 + ( -2y)^2}{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Let me expand the numerator:

\( (2x + 3y)^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 \)

\( (-2y)^2 = 4y^2 \)

So, numerator is \( 4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2 = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \)

So, the ratio squared is:

\[
\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Let me denote \( t = \frac{y}{x} \), assuming \( x \neq 0 \). Then, \( y = tx \), so substituting:

Numerator becomes \( 4x^2 + 12x(tx) + 13(tx)^2 = 4x^2 + 12t x^2 + 13t^2 x^2 = x^2(4 + 12t + 13t^2) \)

Denominator becomes \( x^2 + (tx)^2 = x^2(1 + t^2) \)

So, the ratio squared is:

\[
\frac{4 + 12t + 13t^2}{1 + t^2}
\]

Let me denote this as \( f(t) = \frac{13t^2 + 12t + 4}{t^2 + 1} \). I need to find the maximum of \( f(t) \) over all real numbers \( t \).

To find the maximum, take the derivative of \( f(t) \) with respect to \( t \) and set it to zero.

First, compute \( f'(t) \):

Using the quotient rule:

\( f'(t) = \frac{(26t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (13t^2 + 12t + 4)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} \)

Let me compute the numerator:

First term: \( (26t + 12)(t^2 + 1) = 26t^3 + 26t + 12t^2 + 12 \)

Second term: \( (13t^2 + 12t + 4)(2t) = 26t^3 + 24t^2 + 8t \)

Subtracting the second term from the first:

\( (26t^3 + 26t + 12t^2 + 12) - (26t^3 + 24t^2 + 8t) \)

Simplify term by term:

- \( 26t^3 - 26t^3 = 0 \)
- \( 12t^2 - 24t^2 = -12t^2 \)
- \( 26t - 8t = 18t \)
- \( 12 \) remains

So, numerator is \( -12t^2 + 18t + 12 \)

Set numerator equal to zero:

\( -12t^2 + 18t + 12 = 0 \)

Multiply both sides by -1:

\( 12t^2 - 18t - 12 = 0 \)

Divide both sides by 6:

\( 2t^2 - 3t - 2 = 0 \)

Solve for \( t \):

Using quadratic formula:

\( t = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{4} = \frac{3 \pm 5}{4} \)

So, solutions are:

- \( t = \frac{3 + 5}{4} = 2 \)
- \( t = \frac{3 - 5}{4} = -\frac{1}{2} \)

So, critical points at \( t = 2 \) and \( t = -1/2 \). Now, let's evaluate \( f(t) \) at these points.

First, \( t = 2 \):

\( f(2) = \frac{13*(4) + 12*(2) + 4}{4 + 1} = \frac{52 + 24 + 4}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16 \)

Second, \( t = -1/2 \):

\( f(-1/2) = \frac{13*(1/4) + 12*(-1/2) + 4}{(1/4) + 1} = \frac{13/4 - 6 + 4}{5/4} \)

Compute numerator:

13/4 is 3.25, minus 6 is -2.75, plus 4 is 1.25. So, 1.25 is 5/4.

Denominator is 5/4.

So, \( f(-1/2) = (5/4) / (5/4) = 1 \)

So, the maximum value of \( f(t) \) is 16, which occurs at \( t = 2 \). Therefore, the maximum of \( \|A\mathbf{v}\| / \|\mathbf{v}\| \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). So, \( C = 4 \).

Wait, that's consistent with the singular value approach. So, both methods give me the same result. Therefore, I can be confident that the smallest such \( C \) is 4.

Just to make sure, let me test with a specific vector. If I take \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \), then:

\( A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2*1 + 3*2 \\ 0*1 - 2*2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ 0 - 4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \)

The norm of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is \( \sqrt{8^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 16} = \sqrt{80} = 4\sqrt{5} \)

The norm of \( \mathbf{v} \) is \( \sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{1 + 4} = \sqrt{5} \)

So, the ratio is \( 4\sqrt{5} / \sqrt{5} = 4 \), which matches our result. So, that's a good check.

Another test: take \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1/2 \end{pmatrix} \). Then,

\( A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2*1 + 3*(-1/2) \\ 0*1 - 2*(-1/2) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 - 1.5 \\ 0 + 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \)

Norm of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is \( \sqrt{0.25 + 1} = \sqrt{1.25} \approx 1.118 \)

"Okay, so I have this math problem here: $1^{(2^{235423523})}$. Hmm, that's a pretty big exponent. Let me try to figure out what this equals. 

First, I remember that any number raised to the power of 1 is just itself. So, 1 to any power should still be 1, right? But wait, let me make sure I'm not missing something here. The exponent is 2 raised to the power of 235,423,523. That's an enormous number, but does that affect the result?

Let me think about exponents for a second. The expression is 1 raised to some power. I know that 1 multiplied by itself any number of times is always 1. So, even if the exponent is a huge number like 2^235423523, it doesn't change the fact that 1 to any power is 1. 

Wait, is there a case where 1 raised to a power isn't 1? I don't think so. Even if the exponent is zero, 1^0 is 1. If the exponent is negative, 1^-n is still 1 because it's 1/(1^n), which is 1/1, which is 1. So, regardless of what the exponent is, positive, negative, zero, or even a huge number like this, 1 raised to that exponent is always 1.

Let me double-check with a smaller exponent to make sure. For example, 1^2 is 1, 1^10 is 1, 1^1000 is still 1. Yeah, that seems consistent. So, no matter how big the exponent is, as long as the base is 1, the result is always 1.

Therefore, even though 2^235423523 is an astronomically large number, when it's the exponent of 1, the result is just 1. I don't think I need to calculate the actual value of 2^235423523 because it doesn't affect the outcome here. It's all about the base being 1.

So, putting it all together, $1^{(2^{235423523})}$ simplifies to 1. I feel confident about this because the properties of exponents with base 1 are pretty straightforward. There's no trick or hidden step here; it's just a matter of recognizing that 1 to any power remains 1.

I guess another way to look at it is by using logarithms or exponent rules, but honestly, it's unnecessary in this case. The fundamental property of 1 as a base in exponents makes this problem much simpler than it initially looks. It's a good reminder that sometimes, even with intimidating numbers, the underlying math can be quite basic.

In summary, after considering the properties of exponents and testing with smaller numbers, I'm certain that the result is 1. The massive exponent doesn't change the fact that 1 raised to any power is always 1.
</think>

The expression $1^{(2^{235423523})}$ simplifies to 1 because any number raised to any power remains 1 when the base is 1.

"Alright, so I have this problem where z is a complex number such that z^5 = 1 and z is not equal to 1. I need to compute the value of the expression z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when dealing with complex numbers and roots of unity, it's often helpful to express them in polar form. Since z^5 = 1, z is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation z^5 - 1 = 0. These roots can be expressed as e^(2πik/5) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. But since z ≠ 1, we're looking at the roots where k = 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, z can be written as e^(2πik/5) where k is 1, 2, 3, or 4. That means z is a primitive 5th root of unity. Now, I need to compute the expression z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2. Let me see if I can simplify this expression.

I notice that 1/z is the same as z^4 because z^5 = 1 implies that z^4 = 1/z. Similarly, 1/z^2 is the same as z^3. So, substituting these into the expression, we get:

z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

So, the expression simplifies to z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4. Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I remember that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. That is, 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0. Since z ≠ 1, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1.

Wait, so does that mean the expression z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 is equal to -1? If that's the case, then the original expression z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 is also equal to -1. That seems too straightforward. Let me verify this.

Let me write down the sum of the roots:

1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0.

Subtracting 1 from both sides gives:

z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1.

Yes, that's correct. So, substituting back, since 1/z = z^4 and 1/z^2 = z^3, the expression becomes z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3, which is exactly the sum we just found to be -1. Therefore, the value of the expression is -1.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't skip any steps or make any mistakes. Let me try plugging in a specific value of z to test this. Let's take z = e^(2πi/5). Then, z^5 = 1, and z ≠ 1. Let's compute the expression:

z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2.

Since 1/z = z^4 and 1/z^2 = z^3, this becomes z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. As we saw earlier, this sum is -1. Let me compute it numerically to check.

First, compute z = e^(2πi/5). The value of z is cos(2π/5) + i sin(2π/5). Similarly, z^2 = cos(4π/5) + i sin(4π/5), z^3 = cos(6π/5) + i sin(6π/5), and z^4 = cos(8π/5) + i sin(8π/5).

Adding these up:

z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = [cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5) + cos(6π/5) + cos(8π/5)] + i [sin(2π/5) + sin(4π/5) + sin(6π/5) + sin(8π/5)].

I know that the imaginary parts should cancel out because the roots are symmetrically distributed around the unit circle. Let me compute the real parts:

cos(2π/5) ≈ 0.3090,
cos(4π/5) ≈ -0.8090,
cos(6π/5) ≈ -0.8090,
cos(8π/5) ≈ 0.3090.

Adding these together: 0.3090 - 0.8090 - 0.8090 + 0.3090 = (0.3090 + 0.3090) + (-0.8090 - 0.8090) = 0.618 - 1.618 = -1.

So, the real part is -1, and the imaginary part is zero, confirming that the sum is indeed -1. Therefore, the expression z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 equals -1.

Alternatively, another approach is to recognize that for roots of unity, certain symmetries and properties can be exploited. Since z^5 = 1, we can write z^k = z^{k mod 5}. So, 1/z = z^4, 1/z^2 = z^3, and so on. Therefore, the expression becomes z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3, which we already know sums to -1.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, and the numerical check confirms it. So, the value of the expression is -1.

**Final Answer**
The value of the expression is \boxed{-1}.
</think>

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to compute the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, which can be expressed as \( e^{2\pi ik/5} \) for \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). The 5th roots of unity satisfy the equation \( z^5 = 1 \), and the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero:
\[ 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0. \]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:
\[ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1. \]

Next, we note that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \) because \( z^5 = 1 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

This simplifies to the sum \( z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 \), which we already know is equal to -1. Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"Okay, so I have this expression to simplify: \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that secant is the reciprocal of cosine, so maybe I can rewrite the first term using that identity. Let me try that.

So, \(\sec x\) is equal to \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\). Therefore, the first term \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x}\) becomes \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). Now, the expression looks like \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\). 

Hmm, both terms have a \(\cos x\) in the denominator, so maybe I can combine them by finding a common denominator. The first term already has \(\cos x \sin x\) as the denominator, and the second term has just \(\cos x\). So, to combine them, I need to adjust the second term to have the same denominator as the first term.

To do that, I can multiply both the numerator and denominator of the second term by \(\sin x\). That way, the denominator becomes \(\cos x \sin x\), which matches the first term. Let me write that out:

The second term is \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), so multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\sin x\) gives \(\frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x}\), which simplifies to \(\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Now, the expression becomes \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\). Since both terms have the same denominator, I can subtract the numerators:

\(1 - \sin^2 x\) over the common denominator \(\cos x \sin x\). So, that's \(\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Wait, I remember that \(1 - \sin^2 x\) is equal to \(\cos^2 x\) from the Pythagorean identity. So, substituting that in, the expression becomes \(\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).

Now, I can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator. That leaves me with \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\).

Hmm, \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is another trigonometric identity. I think that's equal to \(\cot x\). So, putting it all together, the simplified form of the original expression is \(\cot x\).

Let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting from the beginning:

1. Rewrote \(\sec x\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\), so the first term became \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\).
2. The second term was \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), which I adjusted to have the same denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\sin x\), resulting in \(\frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).
3. Subtracted the two fractions: \(\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).
4. Recognized that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), so the expression became \(\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}\).
5. Simplified by canceling one \(\cos x\), resulting in \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\), which is \(\cot x\).

Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any errors in the algebra or the trigonometric identities. So, I'm confident that the simplified form is indeed \(\cot x\).

**Final Answer**
The simplified expression is \boxed{\cot x}.
</think>

To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by rewriting \(\sec x\) as \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\). This transforms the first term into \(\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). The expression then becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we adjust the second term to have the same denominator as the first term by multiplying both the numerator and denominator by \(\sin x\):

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, we can combine the two terms:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\), we substitute and simplify:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recognizing that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is \(\cot x\), we conclude that the simplified expression is:

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( a + b \) given that the product of two quadratic polynomials \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \) is equal to \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but since these are quadratics, it's a bit more involved. So, I need to multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.

Let me write down the multiplication step by step. The first polynomial is \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and the second one is \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \). So, I'll distribute each term in the first polynomial across the second polynomial.

Starting with the \( 3t^2 \) term:
- \( 3t^2 \times 4t^2 = 12t^4 \)
- \( 3t^2 \times bt = 3bt^3 \)
- \( 3t^2 \times (-2) = -6t^2 \)

Next, the \( 5t \) term:
- \( 5t \times 4t^2 = 20t^3 \)
- \( 5t \times bt = 5bt^2 \)
- \( 5t \times (-2) = -10t \)

Then, the \( a \) term:
- \( a \times 4t^2 = 4at^2 \)
- \( a \times bt = abt \)
- \( a \times (-2) = -2a \)

Now, let me write down all these terms together:
- \( 12t^4 \)
- \( 3bt^3 + 20t^3 \)
- \( -6t^2 + 5bt^2 + 4at^2 \)
- \( -10t + abt \)
- \( -2a \)

Now, I need to combine like terms. Let's group them by the power of \( t \):

1. **\( t^4 \) terms**: Only \( 12t^4 \).
2. **\( t^3 \) terms**: \( 3bt^3 + 20t^3 = (3b + 20)t^3 \).
3. **\( t^2 \) terms**: \( -6t^2 + 5bt^2 + 4at^2 = (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 \).
4. **\( t \) terms**: \( -10t + abt = (-10 + ab)t \).
5. **Constant term**: \( -2a \).

So, putting it all together, the product polynomial is:
\[ 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a \]

Now, according to the problem, this product is equal to \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \). That means the coefficients of corresponding powers of \( t \) must be equal. So, I can set up equations by equating the coefficients.

Let's list the coefficients:

1. For \( t^4 \): Both sides have 12, so that's already matching.
2. For \( t^3 \): \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
3. For \( t^2 \): \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
4. For \( t \): \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
5. For the constant term: \( -2a = 6 \)

Okay, so now I have a system of equations:

1. \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)  (from \( t^3 \) terms)
2. \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)  (from \( t^2 \) terms)
3. \( -10 + ab = -16 \)  (from \( t \) terms)
4. \( -2a = 6 \)  (from the constant term)

Let me solve these equations step by step.

Starting with equation 4: \( -2a = 6 \). Solving for \( a \):
\[ -2a = 6 \]
Divide both sides by -2:
\[ a = 6 / (-2) \]
\[ a = -3 \]

Okay, so \( a = -3 \). Now, let's plug this value into the other equations.

Looking at equation 1: \( 3b + 20 = 26 \). Let's solve for \( b \):
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[ 3b = 26 - 20 \]
\[ 3b = 6 \]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[ b = 2 \]

So, \( b = 2 \). Now, let's check if these values satisfy the other equations.

First, equation 3: \( -10 + ab = -16 \). Plugging \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \):
\[ -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 -6 = -16 \]
Which matches the right side, so that's good.

Now, equation 2: \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \). Plugging \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \):
\[ -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 -12 \]
Calculating step by step:
- \( 5(2) = 10 \)
- \( 4(-3) = -12 \)
So, \( -6 + 10 -12 = (-6 -12) +10 = -18 +10 = -8 \)
Which also matches the right side. Perfect.

So, both \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \) satisfy all the equations. Therefore, \( a + b = (-3) + 2 = -1 \).

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with equation 4: \( -2a = 6 \) gives \( a = -3 \). Correct.

Equation 1: \( 3b + 20 = 26 \) leads to \( 3b = 6 \), so \( b = 2 \). Correct.

Equation 3: \( -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 -6 = -16 \). Correct.

Equation 2: \( -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 +10 -12 = -8 \). Correct.

So, all equations are satisfied. Therefore, \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = -1 \).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{-1}.
</think>

To find the value of \( a + b \) given that the product of the polynomials \( 3t^2 + 5t + a \) and \( 4t^2 + bt - 2 \) is \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

Expanding \( (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \):

1. Multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:
   - \( 3t^2 \times 4t^2 = 12t^4 \)
   - \( 3t^2 \times bt = 3bt^3 \)
   - \( 3t^2 \times (-2) = -6t^2 \)
   - \( 5t \times 4t^2 = 20t^3 \)
   - \( 5t \times bt = 5bt^2 \)
   - \( 5t \times (-2) = -10t \)
   - \( a \times 4t^2 = 4at^2 \)
   - \( a \times bt = abt \)
   - \( a \times (-2) = -2a \)

2. Combine like terms:
   - \( 12t^4 \)
   - \( (3b + 20)t^3 \)
   - \( (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 \)
   - \( (-10 + ab)t \)
   - \( -2a \)

3. Equate the coefficients of the resulting polynomial with the given polynomial \( 12t^4 + 26t^3 -8t^2 -16t +6 \):
   - For \( t^3 \): \( 3b + 20 = 26 \)
   - For \( t^2 \): \( -6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \)
   - For \( t \): \( -10 + ab = -16 \)
   - For the constant term: \( -2a = 6 \)

4. Solve the system of equations:
   - From \( -2a = 6 \), we get \( a = -3 \).
   - From \( 3b + 20 = 26 \), we get \( 3b = 6 \) so \( b = 2 \).
   - Verify with the other equations:
     - \( -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \)
     - \( -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -8 \)

Both values satisfy all equations, so \( a = -3 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = -3 + 2 = -1 \).

The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{-1}.","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True

"Alright, so I have this piecewise function f(x) defined as:

f(x) = { ax² if x ≥ a,
         ax + 2a if x < a }

And I need to find the maximum value of 'a' such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, let me visualize the function. It's a piecewise function, so it has two parts: a quadratic part for x ≥ a and a linear part for x < a. The quadratic part is ax², which is a parabola opening upwards if a is positive, and downwards if a is negative. The linear part is ax + 2a, which is a straight line with slope a and y-intercept 2a.

Since the function is piecewise, the point where it changes from one piece to the other is at x = a. So, at x = a, both expressions should meet, right? Let me check that.

For x = a, the quadratic part gives f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. The linear part gives f(a) = a*(a) + 2a = a² + 2a. For the function to be continuous at x = a, these two should be equal. So:

a³ = a² + 2a

Let me solve this equation for a.

a³ - a² - 2a = 0
a(a² - a - 2) = 0

So, either a = 0 or a² - a - 2 = 0.

Solving a² - a - 2 = 0:

Using quadratic formula: a = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2

So, a = (1 + 3)/2 = 2 or a = (1 - 3)/2 = -1

Therefore, the possible values for a where the function is continuous at x = a are a = 0, a = 2, and a = -1.

But wait, the problem doesn't specify that the function has to be continuous. It just says it's a piecewise function. So maybe continuity isn't a requirement here? Hmm, but if it's not continuous, the graph might have a jump, which could affect whether every horizontal line intersects it. Hmm, maybe I should consider both cases: continuous and discontinuous.

But let's see. The problem is about the graph intersecting every horizontal line at least once. So, for every y, there exists an x such that f(x) = y. That means the function must be surjective onto its range. So, the range of f(x) must cover all real numbers, or at least, every horizontal line must intersect the graph.

Wait, but depending on the value of 'a', the function might have a limited range. For example, if a is positive, the quadratic part is a parabola opening upwards, which tends to infinity as x increases. The linear part is a straight line with slope a, so if a is positive, it's increasing. If a is negative, the quadratic part is a downward opening parabola, and the linear part is a decreasing line.

So, let's analyze the function for different values of 'a'.

Case 1: a = 0

If a = 0, then f(x) becomes:

f(x) = { 0 if x ≥ 0,
         0 + 0 = 0 if x < 0 }

So, f(x) is always 0. Therefore, the graph is just the x-axis. So, the only horizontal line it intersects is y=0. But the problem says ""every horizontal line"", which would require the function to take all real values. So, a=0 is not suitable because it only takes the value 0.

Case 2: a > 0

Let's take a positive 'a'. Then, the quadratic part is a parabola opening upwards, and the linear part is a line with positive slope.

At x = a, the quadratic part is a³, and the linear part is a² + 2a. For continuity, we saw that a³ = a² + 2a, which gives a = 2 or a = -1. But since we're considering a > 0, a = 2 is the solution.

But wait, if a is not 2, then the function is discontinuous at x = a. So, for a > 0 and a ≠ 2, the function has a jump at x = a.

Let me think about the behavior of the function.

For x ≥ a, f(x) = ax², which goes to infinity as x increases. For x < a, f(x) = ax + 2a, which is a line. If a > 0, this line is increasing. So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches a from the left, f(x) approaches a*a + 2a = a² + 2a.

But if the function is continuous at x = a, then f(a) = a³ = a² + 2a, which is only true for a = 2 or a = -1. So, for a = 2, the function is continuous, and the quadratic part starts at (2, 8) and goes up, while the linear part approaches 8 as x approaches 2 from the left.

For a > 0 but a ≠ 2, the function is discontinuous at x = a. So, the linear part approaches a² + 2a as x approaches a from the left, and the quadratic part starts at a³. So, if a² + 2a ≠ a³, there's a jump.

Now, for the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of f(x) must cover all real numbers. Let's see.

For a > 0:

- The quadratic part (x ≥ a) goes from a³ to infinity.
- The linear part (x < a) goes from negative infinity up to a² + 2a.

So, if a² + 2a ≥ a³, then the linear part reaches up to a² + 2a, and the quadratic part starts at a³. If a² + 2a ≥ a³, then the function's range is (-∞, a² + 2a] ∪ [a³, ∞). But for the function to cover all real numbers, the gap between a² + 2a and a³ must be closed. That is, a² + 2a must be ≥ a³.

Wait, but if a² + 2a ≥ a³, then the maximum of the linear part is greater than or equal to the minimum of the quadratic part, so the function's range is (-∞, ∞). But if a² + 2a < a³, then there's a gap between a² + 2a and a³, meaning the function doesn't take values in (a² + 2a, a³), so it doesn't intersect horizontal lines in that interval.

Therefore, to ensure that the function is surjective (covers all real numbers), we need a² + 2a ≥ a³.

Let's solve the inequality a² + 2a ≥ a³.

Bring all terms to one side:

a³ - a² - 2a ≤ 0

Factor:

a(a² - a - 2) ≤ 0

We can factor the quadratic:

a² - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1)

So, the inequality becomes:

a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0

Now, let's find the intervals where this product is ≤ 0.

The roots are a = -1, 0, 2.

We can test intervals:

1. a < -1: Let's pick a = -2. (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = (-2)(4) = -8 ≤ 0. So, satisfies.

2. -1 < a < 0: Let's pick a = -0.5. (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = (-0.5)(-1.25) = 0.625 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

3. 0 < a < 2: Let's pick a = 1. (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 ≤ 0. Satisfies.

4. a > 2: Let's pick a = 3. (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0. Doesn't satisfy.

So, the inequality a(a - 2)(a + 1) ≤ 0 holds for a ≤ -1 and 0 ≤ a ≤ 2.

But we are considering a > 0 in this case, so 0 ≤ a ≤ 2.

But wait, when a = 0, as we saw earlier, the function is constant 0, which doesn't cover all real numbers. So, a must be greater than 0.

Therefore, for 0 < a ≤ 2, the inequality holds, meaning a² + 2a ≥ a³, so the function's range is (-∞, ∞), meaning every horizontal line intersects the graph.

But wait, when a = 2, the function is continuous, so the linear part meets the quadratic part at x = 2, and the function is smooth there. For a < 2, the function is discontinuous at x = a, but the linear part still reaches up to a² + 2a, which is greater than or equal to a³, so the quadratic part starts at a³, which is less than or equal to a² + 2a, so the function's range is all real numbers.

Wait, but if a is less than 2, say a = 1, then a² + 2a = 1 + 2 = 3, and a³ = 1. So, the linear part goes up to 3, and the quadratic part starts at 1, so the function's range is (-∞, 3] ∪ [1, ∞). But wait, that's not all real numbers because between 1 and 3, the function doesn't take any values. Wait, no, because the quadratic part starts at 1 and goes to infinity, and the linear part goes up to 3. So, actually, the function's range is (-∞, 3] ∪ [1, ∞). But 1 is less than 3, so the union is (-∞, ∞). Wait, no, because the quadratic part starts at 1 and goes up, and the linear part goes up to 3. So, the function's range is (-∞, 3] ∪ [1, ∞). But 1 is less than 3, so the union is (-∞, ∞). Wait, no, because the quadratic part starts at 1 and goes to infinity, and the linear part goes up to 3. So, the function's range is (-∞, 3] ∪ [1, ∞).

"Alright, so I have this equation: \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\). I need to find the value of \(c\) such that the circle described by this equation has a radius of 1. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the general equation of a circle is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius. So, I need to rewrite the given equation into this standard form by completing the square for both the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\]

Let me group the \(x\) terms and the \(y\) terms together:
\[(x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0\]

Now, I'll complete the square for the \(x\) terms. The coefficient of \(x\) is -10. To complete the square, I take half of -10, which is -5, and square it to get 25. So, I add and subtract 25 inside the equation.

Similarly, for the \(y\) terms, the coefficient is 6. Half of 6 is 3, and squaring that gives 9. So, I add and subtract 9 for the \(y\) terms.

Let me write that out:
\[(x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25) + (y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9) + c = 0\]

Simplifying this, it becomes:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\]

Now, combining the constants:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 25 - 9 + c = 0\]
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 + (c - 34) = 0\]

To get the standard form, I'll move the constant term to the other side:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\]

So, now the equation is in the standard circle form, where the center is at \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\). Since the radius is given as 1, the radius squared should be \(1^2 = 1\).

Therefore, I can set up the equation:
\[34 - c = 1\]

Solving for \(c\):
\[34 - 1 = c\]
\[c = 33\]

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. I completed the square correctly for both \(x\) and \(y\), added and subtracted the necessary constants, and then moved the constants to the other side. The radius squared is indeed \(34 - c\), and setting that equal to 1 gives \(c = 33\). Yeah, that seems right.

So, the value of \(c\) should be 33.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(c\) is \boxed{33}.
</think>

To find the value of \(c\) such that the circle described by the equation \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\) has a radius of 1, we start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation.

First, we group the \(x\) and \(y\) terms:
\[
(x^2 - 10x) + (y^2 + 6y) + c = 0
\]

Next, we complete the square for the \(x\) terms and the \(y\) terms:
- For \(x^2 - 10x\), we add and subtract 25: \((x - 5)^2 - 25\)
- For \(y^2 + 6y\), we add and subtract 9: \((y + 3)^2 - 9\)

Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
\]

Combining the constants:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
\]

Rewriting this in standard form:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
\]

Since the radius is 1, the radius squared is 1. Therefore, we set:
\[
34 - c = 1
\]

Solving for \(c\):
\[
c = 34 - 1 = 33
\]

Thus, the value of \(c\) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(f(x)) = x, but f(x) ≠ x. The function given is f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, okay, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f(x) is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common function in chaos theory and population dynamics. The parameter λ controls the shape of the parabola. When λ is between 0 and 4, the function maps the interval [0,1] into itself, which is good because we're dealing with x in [0,1].

The problem is asking for λ values where f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x. So, essentially, we're looking for points x that are periodic points of period 2, meaning they return to themselves after two iterations of f, but they are not fixed points (since f(x) ≠ x). These are called period-2 points.

To find such λ, I need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x and exclude the solutions where f(x) = x. Let me write down the equations.

First, let's compute f(f(x)). Since f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let's compute that:

f(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)].

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

We need this equal to x:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me rearrange this equation:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, the solutions are either x = 0 or the term in the brackets equals zero:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

But x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is also a fixed point because f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1) = 0, which is different from 1, so x=1 is not a fixed point. Wait, actually, f(1) = 0, so f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0, so f(f(1)) = 0 ≠ 1, so x=1 is not a solution to f(f(x))=x. So, x=0 is a fixed point, but we need solutions where f(x) ≠ x, so x=0 is not what we want. So, we can focus on the other factor:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me expand this expression step by step.

First, let's compute (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

Let me denote y = x(1 - x). Then, (1 - x)(1 - λy) = (1 - x) - λy(1 - x).

But y = x(1 - x), so substituting back:

(1 - x) - λx(1 - x)(1 - x) = (1 - x) - λx(1 - x)^2.

So, expanding this:

(1 - x) - λx(1 - 2x + x^2) = 1 - x - λx + 2λx^2 - λx^3.

So, putting it all together:

λ^2 [1 - x - λx + 2λx^2 - λx^3] - 1 = 0.

Wait, no, actually, I think I made a miscalculation. Let me go back.

Wait, the expression is λ^2*(1 - x)*(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 = 0.

Let me compute (1 - x)*(1 - λx(1 - x)) first.

Let me expand (1 - x)*(1 - λx + λx^2):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1) + 1*(-λx) + 1*(λx^2) - x*(1) - x*(-λx) - x*(λx^2).

So, that's 1 - λx + λx^2 - x + λx^2 - λx^3.

Combine like terms:

1 - (λx + x) + (λx^2 + λx^2) - λx^3.

Which simplifies to:

1 - x(λ + 1) + 2λx^2 - λx^3.

So, now, multiply this by λ^2:

λ^2*(1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3) - 1 = 0.

Expanding this:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3 - 1 = 0.

So, the equation becomes:

-λ^3x^3 + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Let me write it in standard polynomial form:

-λ^3x^3 + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Alternatively, multiplying both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

So, we have a cubic equation in x:

λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

We can factor this equation. Let me see if I can factor it.

Let me try to factor by grouping. Let's group the first two terms and the last two terms:

(λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2) + (λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1)) = 0.

Factor out λ^3x^2 from the first group:

λ^3x^2(x - 2) + [λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1)] = 0.

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe try to factor the entire cubic.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out (x - something). Let me see if x=1 is a root.

Plugging x=1 into the cubic:

λ^3(1) - 2λ^3(1) + λ^2(λ + 1)(1) - (λ^2 - 1) =

λ^3 - 2λ^3 + λ^3 + λ^2 - λ^2 + 1 =

(λ^3 - 2λ^3 + λ^3) + (λ^2 - λ^2) + 1 = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0.

So, x=1 is not a root.

What about x=0? Plugging x=0:

0 - 0 + 0 - (λ^2 - 1) = -(λ^2 - 1). So, this is zero only if λ^2 - 1 = 0, i.e., λ=1 or λ=-1. But λ is between 0 and 4, so λ=1 is a possibility. But x=0 is a root only when λ=1, but we already know x=0 is a fixed point, so we can ignore it for our purposes.

Alternatively, maybe x=1/2 is a root? Let me try x=1/2.

Plugging x=1/2:

λ^3*(1/8) - 2λ^3*(1/4) + λ^2(λ + 1)*(1/2) - (λ^2 - 1) =

(λ^3/8) - (λ^3/2) + (λ^3 + λ^2)/2 - λ^2 + 1.

Let me compute each term:

λ^3/8 - λ^3/2 = (λ^3/8 - 4λ^3/8) = (-3λ^3)/8.

Then, (λ^3 + λ^2)/2 = λ^3/2 + λ^2/2.

So, adding all together:

(-3λ^3/8) + (λ^3/2 + λ^2/2) - λ^2 + 1.

Convert to eighths:

-3λ^3/8 + 4λ^3/8 + 4λ^2/8 - 8λ^2/8 + 8/8.

Combine like terms:

(-3λ^3 + 4λ^3)/8 + (4λ^2 - 8λ^2)/8 + 8/8 =

(λ^3)/8 - (4λ^2)/8 + 1.

So, (λ^3 - 4λ^2 + 8)/8.

Set equal to zero:

(λ^3 - 4λ^2 + 8)/8 = 0 ⇒ λ^3 - 4λ^2 + 8 = 0.

Hmm, not sure if this helps. Maybe not the best approach.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor the cubic equation.

Let me write the cubic as:

λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Let me factor out λ^2 from the first three terms:

λ^2[λx^3 - 2λx^2 + (λ + 1)x] - (λ^2 - 1) = 0.

Hmm, not sure. Alternatively, maybe factor as (ax + b)(cx^2 + dx + e) = 0.

But this might be complicated. Alternatively, perhaps we can consider that f(f(x)) = x implies that x is a fixed point of f^2, the second iterate of f. So, the fixed points of f^2 include the fixed points of f and the period-2 points.

We already know the fixed points of f are solutions to f(x) = x, which are x=0 and x=(λ - 1)/λ, provided that (λ - 1)/λ is in [0,1]. Let me check that.

Solving f(x) = x:

λx(1 - x) = x ⇒ λx - λx^2 = x ⇒ λx - λx^2 - x = 0 ⇒ x(λ - λx - 1) = 0.

So, x=0 or λ - λx -1 =0 ⇒ λ(1 - x) =1 ⇒ x = 1 - 1/λ.

So, x=1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. So, 1 - 1/λ ≥ 0 ⇒ 1/λ ≤1 ⇒ λ ≥1. Also, 1 - 1/λ ≤1, which is always true since 1/λ ≥0.

So, for λ ≥1, x=1 - 1/λ is a fixed point in [0,1]. For λ <1, the only fixed point is x=0.

So, for λ ≥1, f has two fixed points: x=0 and x=1 - 1/λ. For λ <1, only x=0 is a fixed point.

But we are looking for x such that f(f(x))=x but f(x)≠x. So, these are the period-2 points.

So, the equation f(f(x))=x will have solutions which are either fixed points or period-2 points. So, to find the period-2 points, we can subtract the fixed points from the solutions of f(f(x))=x.

So, the equation f(f(x))=x is a cubic equation, as we saw earlier, which has three roots: x=0, x=1 - 1/λ (if λ ≥1), and another root which is the period-2 point.

Wait, but actually, the cubic equation f(f(x))=x can have up to three real roots. For λ in [0,4], we can have different numbers of real roots.

But perhaps a better approach is to consider that f(f(x))=x can be written as f(f(x)) - x =0, which is a cubic equation, and we can factor out the fixed points.

We already know that x=0 is a root, so we can factor out x from the equation f(f(x)) - x =0.

Wait, earlier, we had:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1] = 0.

So, the other roots are given by λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) - 1 =0.

So, let me denote this as:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) =1.

Let me try to solve for x.

Let me set y = x(1 - x). Then, 1 - y = 1 - x + x^2.

Wait, maybe not helpful. Alternatively, let me expand the left-hand side:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) =1.

Wait, earlier, we expanded this to:

λ^2 [1 - (λ +1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3] =1.

So, bringing 1 to the left:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ +1)x + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^3x^3 -1=0.

Which is the same as:

-λ^3x^3 + 2λ^3x^2 - λ^2(λ +1)x + (λ^2 -1)=0.

Alternatively, as I did before, multiply by -1:

λ^3x^3 - 2λ^3x^2 + λ^2(λ +1)x - (λ^2 -1)=0.

Now, perhaps we can factor this cubic equation.

Let me try to factor it as (ax + b)(cx^2 + dx + e) =0.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive angle θ such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The numerator and denominator are both combinations of sine and cosine products. Hmm, okay, let me write it down again to make sure I have it right.

The equation is:

tan θ = [cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°] / [sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°]

Wow, that's a mouthful. I need to simplify both the numerator and the denominator. Maybe I can use some trigonometric identities to make this easier.

Looking at the numerator first: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50.

Hmm, I notice that cos A cos B - sin A sin B is equal to cos(A + B). That's the cosine addition formula. So maybe I can group terms in the numerator accordingly.

Let me try grouping cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20. That would be cos(5 + 20) = cos25°. Similarly, cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50 would be cos(35 + 50) = cos85°. So the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°.

Okay, that's a good start. Now, the numerator is cos25° + cos85°. Maybe I can combine these using another identity. I remember that cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. Let's apply that.

So, cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos[(25+85)/2] cos[(25-85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°). But cosine is even, so cos(-30) = cos30. Therefore, numerator becomes 2 cos55° cos30°.

Alright, moving on to the denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50.

Hmm, let's see. I notice that sin A cos B + cos A sin B is sin(A + B). So maybe I can group terms here as well.

Looking at sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20, that's sin(5 + 20) = sin25°. Similarly, -sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50 can be written as -[sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50] = -sin(35 + 50) = -sin85°. So the denominator simplifies to sin25° - sin85°.

Now, sin25 - sin85. I can use the identity sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]. Let's apply that.

So, sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos[(25+85)/2] sin[(25-85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°). Since sin(-30) = -sin30, this becomes 2 cos55° (-1/2) = -cos55°.

So now, the denominator is -cos55°.

Putting it all together, tan θ = [2 cos55 cos30] / [-cos55] = [2 cos30] / (-1) = -2 cos30°.

Wait, cos30° is √3/2, so this becomes -2*(√3/2) = -√3.

So tan θ = -√3.

Now, I need to find the smallest positive angle θ where tan θ = -√3. Hmm, tangent is negative, so θ must be in a quadrant where tangent is negative, which is either the second or fourth quadrant. But since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, it should be in the fourth quadrant, but angles in the fourth quadrant are between 270° and 360°, which is larger than 180°, but maybe I can find a reference angle.

Wait, actually, the principal value of arctangent gives angles between -90° and 90°, but since we need a positive angle, perhaps we can add 180° to the negative angle.

So, tan θ = -√3. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so the angle in the fourth quadrant would be 360° - 60° = 300°, but that's a positive angle. However, 300° is larger than 180°, but is there a smaller positive angle?

Wait, no, because in the range of 0° to 360°, the solutions for tan θ = -√3 are 120° and 300°. But 120° is in the second quadrant, and 300° is in the fourth. Since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, 120° is smaller than 300°, but wait, tan 120° is tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So θ could be 120°, which is smaller than 300°.

But wait, is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is less than 180°, but is there a smaller angle between 0° and 180° where tan θ = -√3? No, because in the first and third quadrants, tangent is positive, so the next possible angle is 120°, which is the smallest positive angle where tan θ = -√3.

Wait, but hold on, 120° is in the second quadrant, and 300° is in the fourth. So 120° is smaller than 300°, so 120° is the smallest positive angle. But let me confirm.

Alternatively, sometimes people consider the principal value as between -90° and 90°, but since we need a positive angle, we can add 180° to the negative angle. So arctan(-√3) is -60°, so adding 180° gives 120°, which is the smallest positive angle.

Therefore, θ = 120°.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when simplifying, I might have made a mistake.

Starting with the numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50.

Grouped as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos25 + cos85.

Then, cos25 + cos85 = 2 cos55 cos30, which is correct.

Denominator: sin5 cos20 - sin35 cos50 + cos5 sin20 - cos35 sin50.

Grouped as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin25 - sin85.

Then, sin25 - sin85 = 2 cos55 sin(-30) = -cos55, correct.

So numerator is 2 cos55 cos30, denominator is -cos55, so tan θ = (2 cos30)/(-1) = -√3.

Yes, that seems right.

So tan θ = -√3, so θ is 120°, which is the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but let me think again. Is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because sometimes, depending on the context, the angle could be in the fourth quadrant, but 300° is larger than 180°, so 120° is indeed smaller.

Alternatively, if we consider the general solution for tan θ = -√3, it's θ = 120° + 180°k, where k is integer. The smallest positive angle is 120°, so that's the answer.

I think that's solid. So θ is 120 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest positive angle θ is \boxed{120^\circ}.

First, we simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
Using the cosine addition formula, we group terms:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
Using the sum-to-product identity:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
Using the sine addition formula, we group terms:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Using the difference-to-product identity:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = -\cos 55^\circ
\]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -2 \cos 30^\circ = -\sqrt{3}
\]

The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) where \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(120^\circ\), as it is the smallest positive angle in the second quadrant where tangent is negative.

Thus, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is \(\boxed{120^\circ}\).","[120, '120^\\circ']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",True

"Alright, so I need to figure out how many trailing zeros are in 42 factorial, which is written as 42!. Hmm, I remember that the number of trailing zeros in a factorial is related to how many times the number 10 is a factor in that factorial. Since 10 is 2 multiplied by 5, I think I need to count how many pairs of 2s and 5s are in the prime factors of 42!.

But wait, I also recall that in any factorial, there are usually more 2s than 5s. So, the number of trailing zeros is actually determined by the number of 5s in the prime factors. That makes sense because 2s are more plentiful, so the 5s are the limiting factor. So, my task is to count how many times 5 appears as a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

Okay, how do I count the number of 5s? I think I need to divide 42 by 5 and take the integer part of the result. Let me try that. 42 divided by 5 is 8.4, so the integer part is 8. That means there are 8 multiples of 5 between 1 and 42. But wait, some numbers might contribute more than one 5. For example, 25 is 5 squared, so it contributes two 5s. Similarly, 50 would contribute two 5s, but 50 is beyond 42, so I don't need to worry about that here.

So, I need to check if there are any numbers between 1 and 42 that are multiples of 25. Let's see, 25 is 25, and 50 is beyond 42, so only 25 is a multiple of 25 in this range. Therefore, I should add an extra 1 to my count because 25 contributes an additional 5.

So, adding that up: 8 (from the first division) plus 1 (from the multiples of 25) equals 9. Is that all? Wait, what about higher powers of 5, like 125? 125 is 5 cubed, but 125 is way larger than 42, so there are no multiples of 125 in this range. Therefore, I don't need to consider any higher powers beyond 25.

So, putting it all together, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 8 (from the multiples of 5) plus 1 (from the multiples of 25), which equals 9. Let me double-check that. If I list out the multiples of 5 up to 42: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40. That's 8 numbers. But 25 is 5 squared, so it adds an extra 5, making it 9 in total. Yeah, that seems right.

I think that's the correct approach. So, the number of trailing zeros in 42! is 9.
</think>

The number of trailing zeros in 42! is determined by counting the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42. 

1. Divide 42 by 5: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = 8 \)
2. Divide 42 by 25: \( \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = 1 \)
3. Higher powers of 5 (like 125) are beyond 42, so they don't contribute.

Adding these together: \( 8 + 1 = 9 \)

"Alright, so I have this function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and I need to find its maximum value where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since the function involves square roots, I should note that the expressions inside the square roots must be non-negative. That means \( 1 - y^2 \geq 0 \) and \( 1 - x^2 \geq 0 \), which is already satisfied because \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. So, no issues there.

I remember that to find the maximum of a function of two variables, I can use calculus. Specifically, I can find the critical points by taking the partial derivatives with respect to \( x \) and \( y \), set them equal to zero, and solve for \( x \) and \( y \). Then, I can check if those points give a maximum.

Let me start by computing the partial derivatives.

First, the partial derivative with respect to \( x \):

\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - x^2)^{-1/2}(-2x) \)

Simplifying that:

\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2}(1 - y^2)^{-1/2}(-2y) \)

Simplifying:

\( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Okay, so to find critical points, I need to set both partial derivatives equal to zero.

So, set \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \):

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)

Similarly, set \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = 0 \):

\( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \)

Hmm, so I have two equations:

1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Let me denote equation 1 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \) --- (1)

And equation 2 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \) --- (2)

Looking at these two equations, maybe I can manipulate them to find a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \).

Let me square both sides of equation (1):

\( (1 - y^2) = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \)

Similarly, square both sides of equation (2):

\( (1 - x^2) = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - y^2} \)

So now, I have:

From (1): \( 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \) --- (1a)

From (2): \( 1 - x^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - y^2} \) --- (2a)

Hmm, interesting. Let me denote \( A = 1 - x^2 \) and \( B = 1 - y^2 \). Then, equation (1a) becomes:

\( B = \frac{x^2 y^2}{A} \)

And equation (2a) becomes:

\( A = \frac{x^2 y^2}{B} \)

So, substituting \( B \) from (1a) into (2a):

\( A = \frac{x^2 y^2}{(x^2 y^2)/A} = \frac{x^2 y^2 \cdot A}{x^2 y^2} = A \)

Wait, that just gives \( A = A \), which is always true. Hmm, that doesn't help much. Maybe I need another approach.

Alternatively, let's consider that both equations (1a) and (2a) are equal to \( x^2 y^2 \) over something. Let me write them again:

From (1a): \( (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

From (2a): \( (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

Wait, actually, both equations are the same. So, squaring both equations led me to the same equation, which is:

\( (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

Let me expand the left side:

\( 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \)

Subtract \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:

\( 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \)

So, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \)

Ah! So, the critical points lie on the unit circle. That's a useful constraint.

So, now I know that \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). So, \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \), which means \( y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Similarly, \( x = \pm \sqrt{1 - y^2} \).

But since in the original function, we have square roots, and the terms \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), the signs of \( x \) and \( y \) will affect the function's value.

Let me consider the first quadrant where \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \). Since the function is symmetric in a way, maybe the maximum occurs in the first quadrant.

So, assuming \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \), then \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). So, substituting \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into the function.

So, let's substitute \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into \( f(x, y) \):

\( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)

But \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), so \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} = \sqrt{x^2} = x \). Similarly, \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = y \).

So, substituting:

\( f(x, y) = x \cdot x + y \cdot y = x^2 + y^2 \)

But since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), this simplifies to:

\( f(x, y) = 1 \)

Wait, so on the unit circle in the first quadrant, the function equals 1. Hmm, interesting.

But is this the maximum? Let me check.

Wait, but if I take \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 0 \), so \( f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} = 1 + 0 = 1 \). Similarly, \( f(0, 1) = 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \). So, at the points (1,0) and (0,1), the function is 1.

But what about other points? For example, take \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Then, \( x^2 + y^2 = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \), so it's on the unit circle.

Compute \( f(x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - (\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})^2} \)

Simplify inside the square roots:

\( 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), so each square root is \( \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

So, \( f(x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \)

So, again, the function is 1. Hmm, so on the entire unit circle in the first quadrant, the function is 1.

But wait, is 1 the maximum? Let me check another point not on the unit circle.

Take \( x = y = \frac{1}{2} \). Then, \( f(x, y) = \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - (\frac{1}{2})^2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - (\frac{1}{2})^2} \)

Compute inside the square roots: \( 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \), so each term is \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \)

So, total \( f(x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 0.866 \), which is less than 1.

So, seems like 1 is higher. What about another point, say \( x = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \), \( y = \frac{1}{2} \). Then, \( x^2 + y^2 = \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 \), so it's on the unit circle.

Compute \( f(x, y) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sqrt{1 - (\frac{1}{2})^2} + \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{1 - (\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2} \)

Simplify:

First term: \( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3}{4} \)

Second term: \( \frac{1}{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \)

Total: \( \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} = 1 \). Again, 1.

So, seems like on the unit circle, the function is always 1. But wait, is that true?

Wait, let me think. If \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), then \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). But since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \) and \( 1 - x^2 = y^2 \). So, substituting:

\( f(x, y) = x \cdot |x| + y \cdot |y| \)

But since we're in the first quadrant, \( x \) and \( y \) are positive, so \( |x| = x \) and \( |y| = y \). Therefore, \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). So, yes, on the unit circle in the first quadrant, the function is 1.

But what about other quadrants? Let's see.

Suppose \( x \) is positive and \( y \) is negative. Then, \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Since \( y \) is negative, the second term is negative. So, the function would be less than \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is less than or equal to 1, because \( x \leq 1 \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \leq 1 \). So, the maximum in other quadrants would be less than or equal to 1.

Similarly, if both \( x \) and \( y \) are negative, then both terms are negative, so the function would be negative, which is definitely less than 1.

Therefore, the maximum must occur in the first quadrant, and on the unit circle, where the function equals 1.

But wait, earlier when I took \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), the function was 1, and when I took \( x = 1 \), \( y = 0 \), it was also 1. So, is 1 the maximum?

But let me check another point. Suppose \( x = \cos \theta \), \( y = \sin \theta \), where \( 0 \leq \theta \leq \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then, \( f(x, y) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \)

Simplify:

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Specifically, vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, okay, so O is the origin, right? Because OA and OB are position vectors from O.

I remember that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found using the cross product. The formula is (1/2) times the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors. So, if I can find the cross product of OA and OB, then take its magnitude and divide by 2, that should give me the area.

Let me write down the vectors again to make sure I have them right. Vector OA is [1, 2, 3] and vector OB is [-3, -2, 1]. So, OA = (1, 2, 3) and OB = (-3, -2, 1). 

Now, to find the cross product OA × OB, I can use the determinant method. The cross product of two vectors (a1, a2, a3) and (b1, b2, b3) is given by the determinant of a matrix with the unit vectors i, j, k in the first row, the components of the first vector in the second row, and the components of the second vector in the third row.

So, setting that up:

i  j  k
1  2  3
-3 -2 1

Calculating the determinant, it's i*(2*1 - 3*(-2)) - j*(1*1 - 3*(-3)) + k*(1*(-2) - 2*(-3)).

Let me compute each component step by step.

First, the i component: 2*1 is 2, and 3*(-2) is -6. So, 2 - (-6) is 2 + 6, which is 8. So, the i component is 8i.

Next, the j component: It's subtracted, so it's - [1*1 - 3*(-3)]. 1*1 is 1, and 3*(-3) is -9. So, 1 - (-9) is 1 + 9, which is 10. So, the j component is -10j.

Then, the k component: 1*(-2) is -2, and 2*(-3) is -6. So, -2 - (-6) is -2 + 6, which is 4. So, the k component is 4k.

Putting it all together, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Wait, let me double-check that. 

Wait, for the j component, it's negative of (1*1 - 3*(-3)). So, 1*1 is 1, 3*(-3) is -9, so 1 - (-9) is 10, and then the negative of that is -10. Yeah, that's correct.

So, OA × OB = 8i -10j +4k, which is the vector (8, -10, 4).

Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude is sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2). Let's compute each term:

8 squared is 64, (-10) squared is 100, and 4 squared is 16. Adding them up: 64 + 100 is 164, plus 16 is 180. So, the magnitude is sqrt(180).

Simplify sqrt(180). 180 can be broken down into 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) is 6*sqrt(5). So, the magnitude of the cross product is 6√5.

Therefore, the area of triangle OAB is (1/2)*6√5, which is 3√5.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any calculation errors. Let me recalculate the cross product:

i component: (2*1) - (3*(-2)) = 2 +6=8. Correct.

j component: -[(1*1) - (3*(-3))] = -[1 +9] = -10. Correct.

k component: (1*(-2)) - (2*(-3)) = -2 +6=4. Correct.

Magnitude: sqrt(8^2 + (-10)^2 +4^2)=sqrt(64+100+16)=sqrt(180)=6√5. Correct.

So, area is (1/2)*6√5=3√5. That seems right.

Alternatively, I can think about the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. It's half the magnitude of the cross product of the two sides. So, yes, that's exactly what I did.

I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the area should be 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) with points \( O \), \( A \), and \( B \) given by the position vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, we calculate the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding the determinant, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j} (1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k} (1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Calculating each component:

- The \( \mathbf{i} \) component: \( 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) = 2 + 6 = 8 \)
- The \( \mathbf{j} \) component: \( -(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) = -(1 + 9) = -10 \)
- The \( \mathbf{k} \) component: \( 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) = -2 + 6 = 4 \)

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Alright, so I have this problem where z is a complex number, and it's given that z + 1/z equals (1 + sqrt(5))/2. I need to find z^85 + 1/z^85. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that expressions like z + 1/z often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Since z is a complex number, maybe I can express it in polar form. Let me recall that any complex number can be written as z = e^{iθ}, where θ is the argument of z. If I do that, then 1/z would be e^{-iθ}, right? So, z + 1/z would be e^{iθ} + e^{-iθ}, which is equal to 2cosθ. 

So, according to the problem, 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let me write that down:

2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2

So, cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Hmm, okay, so θ is the angle whose cosine is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Let me compute that value numerically to get a sense of what θ is. 

Calculating (1 + sqrt(5))/4: sqrt(5) is approximately 2.236, so 1 + 2.236 is about 3.236. Divided by 4, that's roughly 0.809. So, cosθ ≈ 0.809. That means θ is approximately 36 degrees because cos(36°) is about 0.809. Wait, is that exact? Let me check.

I remember that cos(36°) is indeed (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, but wait, no. Let me recall the exact value. Actually, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 divided by 2, so that's (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, no, that's not right. Let me think again.

Wait, cos(36°) is equal to (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 multiplied by 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/2 divided by 2, so that's (sqrt(5) + 1)/4. Wait, no, that's not correct. Let me recall the exact value.

I think cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, so that would be (1 + sqrt(5))/2 divided by 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, that can't be because (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately 0.809, which is actually cos(36°). So, yes, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2 divided by 2, so that's (1 + sqrt(5))/4. Wait, no, that's not correct because (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately 0.809, which is indeed cos(36°). So, θ is 36 degrees or π/5 radians.

Wait, let me confirm. 36 degrees is π/5 radians, right? Because 180 degrees is π radians, so 36 is π/5. So, θ = π/5. Therefore, z = e^{iπ/5} or z = e^{-iπ/5} because cosine is even, so both angles would give the same cosine value.

So, if z = e^{iπ/5}, then z^n = e^{i n π/5}, and 1/z^n = e^{-i n π/5}, so z^n + 1/z^n = 2cos(nπ/5). Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 would be 2cos(85π/5). Let me compute 85π/5. 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 17π. So, 2cos(17π).

But wait, cos(17π) is the same as cos(π) because cosine has a period of 2π. So, cos(17π) = cos(π + 16π) = cos(π) because 16π is 8 full periods. Cos(π) is -1. Therefore, 2cos(17π) = 2*(-1) = -2.

Wait, that seems straightforward, but let me double-check. Maybe I made a mistake in the angle reduction.

So, 85π/5 is 17π. Now, 17π is equal to 8*2π + π, right? Because 8*2π is 16π, so 17π is 16π + π. So, cos(17π) = cos(π) because cosine is periodic with period 2π. So, yes, cos(17π) = cos(π) = -1. Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 = 2*(-1) = -2.

But wait, let me think again. Is z necessarily equal to e^{iπ/5}? Because z + 1/z = 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so 2cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so cosθ = (1 + sqrt(5))/4, which is approximately 0.809, which is cos(36°), so θ is 36°, which is π/5 radians. So, z is e^{iπ/5} or e^{-iπ/5}. So, z^n + 1/z^n is 2cos(nπ/5). So, for n=85, it's 2cos(85π/5) = 2cos(17π) = 2*(-1) = -2.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this using recurrence relations or properties of powers. Let me see.

Given that z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which is the golden ratio, approximately 1.618. Let me denote this value as φ, where φ = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. So, z + 1/z = φ.

I remember that for such expressions, we can use the identity that z^n + 1/z^n can be expressed in terms of φ. Specifically, there's a recurrence relation where z^{n+1} + 1/z^{n+1} = (z^n + 1/z^n)(z + 1/z) - (z^{n-1} + 1/z^{n-1}).

So, if I let a_n = z^n + 1/z^n, then a_{n+1} = a_n * a_1 - a_{n-1}.

Given that a_1 = φ, and a_0 = z^0 + 1/z^0 = 1 + 1 = 2.

So, let's compute a few terms to see if there's a pattern.

a_0 = 2

a_1 = φ

a_2 = a_1 * a_1 - a_0 = φ^2 - 2

But φ^2 = φ + 1, because φ satisfies the equation φ^2 = φ + 1. So, a_2 = (φ + 1) - 2 = φ - 1

Similarly, a_3 = a_2 * a_1 - a_1 = (φ - 1)*φ - φ = φ^2 - φ - φ = φ^2 - 2φ

But φ^2 = φ + 1, so a_3 = (φ + 1) - 2φ = -φ + 1

a_4 = a_3 * a_1 - a_2 = (-φ + 1)*φ - (φ - 1) = -φ^2 + φ - φ + 1 = -φ^2 + 1

Again, φ^2 = φ + 1, so a_4 = -(φ + 1) + 1 = -φ -1 +1 = -φ

a_5 = a_4 * a_1 - a_3 = (-φ)*φ - (-φ + 1) = -φ^2 + φ -1

But φ^2 = φ + 1, so a_5 = -(φ + 1) + φ -1 = -φ -1 + φ -1 = -2

a_6 = a_5 * a_1 - a_4 = (-2)*φ - (-φ) = -2φ + φ = -φ

a_7 = a_6 * a_1 - a_5 = (-φ)*φ - (-2) = -φ^2 + 2 = -(φ +1) + 2 = -φ -1 +2 = -φ +1

a_8 = a_7 * a_1 - a_6 = (-φ +1)*φ - (-φ) = -φ^2 + φ + φ = -φ^2 + 2φ

Again, φ^2 = φ +1, so a_8 = -(φ +1) + 2φ = -φ -1 + 2φ = φ -1

a_9 = a_8 * a_1 - a_7 = (φ -1)*φ - (-φ +1) = φ^2 - φ + φ -1 = φ^2 -1

φ^2 = φ +1, so a_9 = (φ +1) -1 = φ

a_{10} = a_9 * a_1 - a_8 = φ*φ - (φ -1) = φ^2 - φ +1

φ^2 = φ +1, so a_{10} = (φ +1) - φ +1 = 2

Wait a minute, a_{10} is 2, which is the same as a_0. So, the sequence repeats every 10 terms. So, the period is 10.

So, the sequence of a_n is periodic with period 10. So, a_{n+10} = a_n.

Therefore, to find a_{85}, we can compute 85 mod 10, which is 5. So, a_{85} = a_5 = -2.

So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -2.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is using De Moivre's theorem. Since z = e^{iπ/5}, then z^n = e^{i n π/5}, so z^{85} = e^{i 85π/5} = e^{i17π} = e^{iπ} = -1, because e^{iπ} = -1. Similarly, 1/z^{85} = e^{-i17π} = e^{-iπ} = -1. So, z^{85} + 1/z^{85} = -1 + (-1) = -2.

Wait, that's another way to see it. So, regardless of the approach, whether using recurrence relations or directly computing using Euler's formula, we get the same result.

Just to make sure, let me compute 85π/5 again. 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 17π. Since 17 is an odd multiple of π, and cosine of any odd multiple of π is -1. So, 2cos(17π) = 2*(-1) = -2.

Yes, that all checks out. So, I'm confident that the answer is -2.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \boxed{-2}.
</think>

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

First, we recognize that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2 \cos \theta \) where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). Given \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we find that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This value corresponds to \( \cos \frac{\pi}{5} \), so \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \).

Thus, \( z \) can be expressed as \( e^{i \pi / 5} \) or \( e^{-i \pi / 5} \). Using Euler's formula, we know that \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = 2 \cos \left( \frac{n \pi}{5} \right) \).

To find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we compute:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos \left( \frac{85 \pi}{5} \right) = 2 \cos (17 \pi) \]

Since \( \cos (17 \pi) = \cos (\pi) = -1 \) (because cosine has a period of \( 2\pi \) and \( 17 \pi \) is an odd multiple of \( \pi \)), we have:
\[ 2 \cos (17 \pi) = 2 \times (-1) = -2 \]

Thus, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to understand it step by step. 

We have a triangle ABC, and its medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. From G, we draw a line parallel to BC, and this line intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is given as 144, and we need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, wait, ENG? I think I might have misread that. Let me check again. Oh, it's triangle ENG, but I don't recall E and N being defined yet. Wait, E is one of the medians, right? So E is a point on AC, and N is the intersection point on AC from the line drawn from G parallel to BC. So, E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. Similarly, N is another point on AC. So, triangle ENG is formed by points E, N, and G.

Okay, let me visualize this. Triangle ABC with centroid G. Medians AD, BE, CF intersecting at G. From G, draw a line parallel to BC, which meets AB at M and AC at N. So, MN is parallel to BC. Since MN is parallel to BC, triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem or Thales' theorem. 

Since G is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. So, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1. That might be useful.

Given that the area of ABC is 144, we need to find the area of triangle ENG. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, since MN is parallel to BC, triangle AMN is similar to triangle ABC. The ratio of similarity can be determined by the distance from A to MN compared to the distance from A to BC. Since G is the centroid, the line MN passes through G, which is 2/3 of the way along the medians from the vertices. So, the distance from A to MN is 2/3 the height of ABC. Therefore, the ratio of similarity is 2/3.

Wait, but if the ratio is 2/3, then the area ratio would be (2/3)^2 = 4/9. So, the area of triangle AMN would be 4/9 of ABC's area, which is 144. So, 144*(4/9) = 64. So, area of AMN is 64.

But we need the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, let's see. Let me try to figure out where points E, N, and G are located.

Point E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. Point N is on AC, and since MN is parallel to BC, and M is on AB, N must be somewhere between A and C. Since MN is drawn from G, which is the centroid, and MN is parallel to BC, the line MN divides the triangle into two parts: a smaller triangle AMN and a trapezoid MNCB.

But we need to find the area of triangle ENG. Let me think about the coordinates. Maybe assigning coordinates to the triangle ABC would help. Let me place triangle ABC in a coordinate system to make calculations easier.

Let me assume point A is at (0, 0), point B is at (2b, 0), and point C is at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates so that the midpoints will have integer coordinates, making calculations simpler. So, the centroid G will be the average of the coordinates of A, B, and C. So, G's coordinates would be ((0 + 2b + 2c)/3, (0 + 0 + 2d)/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

Now, the median BE goes from B(2b, 0) to E, the midpoint of AC. The midpoint E of AC is ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d). Similarly, the median CF goes from C(2c, 2d) to F, the midpoint of AB, which is (b, 0). The median AD goes from A(0,0) to D, the midpoint of BC, which is ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d).

Now, the line MN is drawn from G parallel to BC. Let me find the equation of BC first. Points B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b). So, the line MN, being parallel to BC, will have the same slope.

Since MN passes through G, which is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3), the equation of MN is y - (2d/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3).

Now, let's find the points M and N where this line intersects AB and AC, respectively.

First, find point M on AB. AB is from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0). So, AB lies along the x-axis, y=0. So, to find M, set y=0 in the equation of MN:

0 - (2d/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify:

-2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:

-2d/3 * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Simplify:

-2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Bring the term on the right to the left:

x = (2b + 2c)/3 - 2(c - b)/3

Simplify numerator:

2b + 2c - 2c + 2b = 4b

So, x = 4b/3

Therefore, point M is at (4b/3, 0).

Similarly, find point N on AC. AC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). Let me parametrize AC. The parametric equations can be written as x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

Now, substitute x and y into the equation of MN:

y - (2d/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Substitute x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t:

2d*t - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify left side:

2d*t - 2d/3 = 2d(t - 1/3)

Right side:

(d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2b/3 - 2c/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2c/3 - 2b/3) = (d/(c - b))(2c(t - 1/3) - 2b/3)

Wait, maybe it's better to solve for t.

So, 2d*t - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)

Divide both sides by d:

2t - 2/3 = (1/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b):

(2t - 2/3)(c - b) = 2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3

Expand left side:

2t(c - b) - (2/3)(c - b) = 2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3

Bring all terms to left:

2t(c - b) - (2/3)(c - b) - 2c*t + (2b + 2c)/3 = 0

Simplify term by term:

2t(c - b) - 2c*t = 2tc - 2tb - 2tc = -2tb

- (2/3)(c - b) + (2b + 2c)/3 = (-2c + 2b + 2b + 2c)/3 = (4b)/3

So, overall:

-2tb + (4b)/3 = 0

Solve for t:

-2tb + 4b/3 = 0

Factor out b:

b(-2t + 4/3) = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0, then:

-2t + 4/3 = 0 => 2t = 4/3 => t = 2/3

So, t = 2/3. Therefore, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3).

Wait, but AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), so t=2/3 gives N at (4c/3, 4d/3). That makes sense.

So, point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3).

Now, we have points E, N, and G.

Point E is the midpoint of AC, which is (c, d).

Point N is (4c/3, 4d/3).

Point G is ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

We need to find the area of triangle ENG.

To find the area, we can use the shoelace formula with coordinates.

Let me list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)

N: (4c/3, 4d/3)

G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

So, let's denote:

E = (x1, y1) = (c, d)

N = (x2, y2) = (4c/3, 4d/3)

G = (x3, y3) = ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

The shoelace formula for area is:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plugging in the values:

Area = |c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3)| / 2

Simplify each term:

First term: c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2cd)/3

Second term: (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = (-4cd)/9

Third term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = (- (2b + 2c)d)/9

So, putting it all together:

Area = |(2cd/3 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9)| / 2

Let me combine the terms:

Convert all to ninths:

2cd/3 = 6cd/9

So, 6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - (2b + 2c)d/9 = (6cd - 4cd - 2bd - 2cd)/9 = (0cd - 2bd)/9 = (-2bd)/9

Take absolute value and divide by 2:

| (-2bd)/9 | / 2 = (2bd)/9 / 2 = (bd)/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is (bd)/9.

But wait, we need to relate this to the area of triangle ABC, which is 144.

What's the area of triangle ABC in terms of b, c, d?

Using coordinates, the area can be calculated using the shoelace formula as well.

Points A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d).

Area ABC = |(0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0))/2| = |0 + 4bd + 0| / 2 = |4bd| / 2 = 2|bd|

Given that area ABC is 144, so 2|bd| = 144 => |bd| = 72.

Therefore, bd = 72 or bd = -72, but since area is positive, we can take bd = 72.

So, the area of triangle ENG is (bd)/9 = 72/9 = 8.

Therefore, the area of triangle ENG is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes signs can mess things up.

In the shoelace formula, I took the absolute value, so the negative sign doesn't matter. So, the area was |(-2bd)/9| / 2 = (2bd)/9 / 2 = bd/9. Since bd = 72, then 72/9 = 8. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ratio approach without coordinates.

Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through centroid G, which divides the median in 2:1. So, the ratio of AM to AB is 2/3, because from A to M is 2/3 of AB. Similarly, AN is 2/3 of AC.

But wait, in the coordinate system, point M was at (4b/3, 0), which is beyond point B if b is positive. Wait, that can't be. Wait, hold on, in my coordinate system, AB is from (0,0) to (2b, 0). So, point M is at (4b/3, 0). If 4b/3 is less than 2b, then it's between A and B. 4b/3 is less than 2b because 4/3 < 2. So, yes, M is between A and B.

Similarly, point N is at (4c/3, 4d/3). Since AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), 4c/3 is less than 2c, so","[2, '2']",8,"[8, '8']",False

"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find how many positive integers n greater than 1 make 2^24 a valid nth power. Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that if 2^24 is an nth power, then there must be some integer k such that k^n = 2^24. So, I can write this as k^n = 2^24. My goal is to find all possible n > 1 for which such a k exists.

Since 2 is a prime number, 2^24 is a power of a prime. That might help simplify things. If k^n = 2^24, then k itself must be a power of 2, right? Because if k had any other prime factors, then k^n would have those primes as well, which isn't the case here. So, let me express k as 2^m, where m is a positive integer.

Substituting back into the equation, we get (2^m)^n = 2^24. Using exponent rules, that simplifies to 2^(m*n) = 2^24. Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, m*n = 24.

So, now the problem reduces to finding all positive integers n > 1 such that n divides 24. Because m has to be an integer, m = 24/n must also be an integer. Therefore, n must be a divisor of 24.

Alright, so I need to find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. Let me list the divisors of 24. The positive divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Since n has to be greater than 1, I can exclude 1 from this list.

So, the possible values of n are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Let me count them: that's 7 numbers. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers n > 1 for which 2^24 is an nth power.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I haven't missed anything. So, n must divide 24, and n > 1. The divisors of 24 are indeed 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Excluding 1, that leaves 7 numbers. Each of these n will give a corresponding k which is 2^(24/n), which is an integer because 24/n is an integer. For example, if n=2, then k=2^12; if n=3, k=2^8; and so on up to n=24, where k=2^1=2. All of these are valid, so I think my reasoning is correct.

I don't think I've missed any divisors. Let me list them again: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Yep, that's 7 numbers. So, the answer should be 7.

**Final Answer**
The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a valid \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) as \( k^n \) where \( k \) is an integer. This implies \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Substituting \( k \) into the equation, we get:

\[
(2^m)^n = 2^{24}
\]

Using exponent rules, this simplifies to:

\[
2^{m \cdot n} = 2^{24}
\]

Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal, giving us:

\[
m \cdot n = 24
\]

Thus, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The positive divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Excluding 1, the valid values of \( n \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Counting these, we find there are 7 such values.

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal expansion of the fraction 4321 divided by (5^7 multiplied by 2^8). Hmm, okay. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that when you have a fraction like this, especially with denominators that are powers of 2 and 5, it's going to result in a terminating decimal. That's because the prime factors of the denominator are only 2s and 5s, which are the same as the base 10 system we use. So, that's a good start because I don't have to deal with repeating decimals or anything like that.

Now, the denominator is 5^7 times 2^8. Let me compute what that is. 5^7 is 5 multiplied by itself 7 times. Let me calculate that:

5^1 = 5  
5^2 = 25  
5^3 = 125  
5^4 = 625  
5^5 = 3125  
5^6 = 15625  
5^7 = 78125

Okay, so 5^7 is 78125. Now, 2^8 is 2 multiplied by itself 8 times:

2^1 = 2  
2^2 = 4  
2^3 = 8  
2^4 = 16  
2^5 = 32  
2^6 = 64  
2^7 = 128  
2^8 = 256

So, 2^8 is 256. Therefore, the denominator is 78125 multiplied by 256. Let me compute that. Hmm, 78125 times 256. That might be a bit tedious, but let's see.

I can break it down: 78125 * 256. Let me think of 256 as 200 + 50 + 6. So, 78125 * 200 is 15,625,000. Then, 78125 * 50 is 3,906,250. And 78125 * 6 is 468,750. Now, adding those together: 15,625,000 + 3,906,250 is 19,531,250. Then, adding 468,750 gives 20,000,000. Wait, that's nice! So, 78125 * 256 is 20,000,000. That's a round number, which is helpful.

So, the denominator simplifies to 20,000,000. Therefore, the fraction is 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let me write that as 4321/20,000,000.

Now, to convert this fraction into a decimal, I can think of it as 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Alternatively, since 20,000,000 is 2 * 10,000,000, I can write this as (4321 / 2) divided by 10,000,000. Let me compute 4321 divided by 2 first.

4321 divided by 2 is 2160.5. So, now, 2160.5 divided by 10,000,000. Dividing by 10,000,000 moves the decimal point seven places to the left. So, starting from 2160.5, moving the decimal seven places left would give me 0.00021605.

Wait, let me verify that. 2160.5 divided by 10,000,000. So, 2160.5 is the same as 21605 * 10^-1. So, dividing by 10,000,000 is multiplying by 10^-7. So, 21605 * 10^-1 * 10^-7 = 21605 * 10^-8. So, that would be 0.00021605. Hmm, okay, that seems right.

Alternatively, I can think of 4321 divided by 20,000,000 as 4321 divided by 2 * 10^7, which is 2160.5 * 10^-7, which is 0.00021605. Yep, same result.

So, the decimal expansion is 0.00021605. Now, I need to find the sum of its digits. Let's write that out: 0.00021605.

Breaking it down digit by digit after the decimal point: the first digit is 0, then another 0, then another 0, then 2, followed by 1, 6, 0, and 5. So, the digits are: 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5.

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure I have the correct number of digits. 0.00021605 has eight digits after the decimal point because 20,000,000 is 10^7 multiplied by 2, so the decimal should have seven zeros after the decimal before the first non-zero digit, but in this case, since 4321 is less than 20,000,000, it's going to have several zeros.

Wait, actually, 4321 divided by 20,000,000 is 0.00021605. Let me count the digits after the decimal: 0.00021605.

So, starting after the decimal: first digit: 0, second: 0, third: 0, fourth: 2, fifth: 1, sixth: 6, seventh: 0, eighth: 5. So, that's eight digits in total after the decimal.

So, the digits are: 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5.

Now, to find the sum of these digits: 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5.

Calculating that: 0+0=0, 0+0=0, 0+2=2, 2+1=3, 3+6=9, 9+0=9, 9+5=14.

So, the sum of the digits is 14.

Wait, but let me double-check my decimal expansion. Maybe I made a mistake in the calculation earlier.

So, 4321 divided by 20,000,000. Let me compute this division step by step.

20,000,000 goes into 4321 how many times? Well, 20,000,000 is much larger than 4321, so it goes 0 times. Then, we add a decimal point and start adding zeros.

So, 4321.00000000 divided by 20,000,000.

We can write this as 4321000000 divided by 20,000,000, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, let's think in terms of moving the decimal.

Since 20,000,000 is 2 * 10^7, dividing by 20,000,000 is the same as dividing by 2 and then by 10^7.

So, 4321 divided by 2 is 2160.5, as I did before. Then, dividing by 10^7 moves the decimal seven places to the left, resulting in 0.00021605.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the decimal expansion is indeed 0.00021605.

So, the digits after the decimal are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. Summing them: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't miss any digits or count incorrectly. Let's write it out:

Position: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  
Digits:    0 0 0 2 1 6 0 5

So, positions 1 to 3 are zeros, position 4 is 2, position 5 is 1, position 6 is 6, position 7 is 0, position 8 is 5.

Adding them up: 0+0+0+2+1+6+0+5=14.

Yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Since the denominator is 5^7 * 2^8, I can adjust the fraction to have a denominator that's a power of 10, which would make the decimal expansion straightforward.

So, 5^7 * 2^8. Let's see, 5^7 is 78125, and 2^8 is 256. But 5^7 * 2^7 would be 10^7, which is 10,000,000. So, 5^7 * 2^8 is 2 * (5^7 * 2^7) = 2 * 10^7 = 20,000,000, which is what I had before.

So, 4321/(5^7 * 2^8) = 4321/20,000,000. To make the denominator a power of 10, I can multiply numerator and denominator by 5 to get rid of the extra 2 in the denominator.

Wait, let me think. 20,000,000 is 2 * 10^7. So, if I multiply numerator and denominator by 5, I get (4321 * 5)/(20,000,000 * 5) = 21605/100,000,000.

Ah, that's a better way to look at it. So, 21605 divided by 100,000,000 is 0.00021605, which is the same as before.

So, the decimal expansion is 0.00021605, and the digits after the decimal are 0,0,0,2,1,6,0,5. Summing them gives 14.

Therefore, the sum of the digits is 14.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. I approached it two different ways: once by directly dividing and once by adjusting the fraction to have a power of 10 denominator, and both gave me the same decimal expansion. So, I'm confident that the sum is 14.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the digits is \boxed{14}.
</think>

To find the sum of the digits in the decimal expansion of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we start by simplifying the denominator.

First, we calculate the powers:
- \(5^7 = 78125\)
- \(2^8 = 256\)

Multiplying these together gives:
\[ 78125 \times 256 = 20,000,000 \]

Thus, the fraction simplifies to:
\[ \frac{4321}{20,000,000} \]

To convert this fraction into a decimal, we note that dividing by 20,000,000 is equivalent to dividing by \(2 \times 10^7\). Therefore, we first divide 4321 by 2:
\[ 4321 \div 2 = 2160.5 \]

Next, we divide by \(10^7\), which moves the decimal point seven places to the left:
\[ 2160.5 \div 10,000,000 = 0.00021605 \]

The decimal expansion of the fraction is \(0.00021605\). The digits after the decimal point are 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. Summing these digits:
\[ 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14 \]

Thus, the sum of the digits is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the product of sines: sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°. Hmm, that's a lot of sine terms multiplied together. I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using certain trigonometric identities or product formulas. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the angles are all multiples of 20°, starting from 20° up to 160°, increasing by 20° each time. So, the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, and 160°. That's eight terms in total. Maybe there's a pattern or a symmetry here that I can exploit.

I recall that sin(180° - x) = sinx. So, let's see which of these angles are supplementary. For example, sin160° is equal to sin20°, because 160° = 180° - 20°. Similarly, sin140° = sin40°, sin120° = sin60°, and sin100° = sin80°. So, that means:

sin160° = sin20°
sin140° = sin40°
sin120° = sin60°
sin100° = sin80°

So, substituting these into the original product, we can rewrite the product as:

sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin80° sin60° sin40° sin20°

Wait, that's interesting. So, the product becomes [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Because each pair (sin20° and sin160°, sin40° and sin140°, etc.) multiplies to sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, and since there are two such pairs, it's squared.

So, now the problem reduces to finding [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2. Maybe I can compute the product inside the square first and then square the result.

I remember that there's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The formula is:

Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}

But wait, in this case, the angles are in degrees, not radians, and they are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are multiples of 20°, so maybe I can express them in terms of π radians.

20° is π/9 radians, 40° is 2π/9, 60° is π/3, and 80° is 4π/9. So, the product is sin(π/9) sin(2π/9) sin(π/3) sin(4π/9). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can use some identities.

Alternatively, I remember that for certain products of sines, especially when the angles are symmetric around 90°, there might be a known product formula. Let me think about the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°.

Wait, another approach: I can pair the terms as sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°, and then use the identity sinA sinB = [cos(A-B) - cos(A+B)] / 2.

Let me try that.

First, compute sin20° sin80°:

sin20° sin80° = [cos(20° - 80°) - cos(20° + 80°)] / 2
= [cos(-60°) - cos(100°)] / 2
= [cos60° - cos100°] / 2
= [0.5 - cos100°] / 2

Similarly, compute sin40° sin60°:

sin40° sin60° = [cos(40° - 60°) - cos(40° + 60°)] / 2
= [cos(-20°) - cos100°] / 2
= [cos20° - cos100°] / 2

So, now the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° becomes:

[sin20° sin80°] * [sin40° sin60°] = ([0.5 - cos100°]/2) * ([cos20° - cos100°]/2)

Let me compute this:

= (0.5 - cos100°)(cos20° - cos100°) / 4

Let me expand the numerator:

= [0.5*cos20° - 0.5*cos100° - cos100°*cos20° + (cos100°)^2] / 4

Hmm, this seems a bit messy. Maybe there's a better way. Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for the product of four sines.

Wait, I recall that for the product sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4. Maybe that can help here.

Let me check: Let A = 20°, then sin20° sin40° sin80°. Wait, 40° is 60° - 20°, and 80° is 60° + 20°, so yes, that fits.

So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4. Wait, is that correct?

Wait, the identity is sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4. So, if A = 20°, then 3A = 60°, so sin60° = sqrt(3)/2. Therefore, sin20° sin40° sin80° = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify:

Using the identity: sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.

So, for A = 20°, sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4 = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8.

Yes, that's correct. So, sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8.

But in our product, we have sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°, which is [sin20° sin40° sin80°] * sin60°. So, that would be (sqrt(3)/8) * sin60°.

Since sin60° = sqrt(3)/2, so the product becomes (sqrt(3)/8) * (sqrt(3)/2) = (3/16).

Wait, so sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° = 3/16.

Therefore, the original product is [3/16]^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me double-check that. Because earlier, I thought of pairing sin20° sin80° and sin40° sin60°, but then I found another approach using the identity for three sines, which gave me a simpler result. So, let me confirm.

If sin20° sin40° sin80° = sqrt(3)/8, then multiplying by sin60°, which is sqrt(3)/2, gives (sqrt(3)/8)*(sqrt(3)/2) = (3)/16. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the product inside the square is 3/16, so the entire original product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the identity. Let me rederive the identity quickly.

The identity is sinA sin(60° - A) sin(60° + A) = (sin3A)/4.

Let me verify this for A = 20°:

sin20° sin40° sin80° = sin20° sin(60° - 20°) sin(60° + 20°) = (sin60°)/4 = (sqrt(3)/2)/4 = sqrt(3)/8.

Yes, that's correct. So, the product of sin20° sin40° sin80° is indeed sqrt(3)/8.

Then, multiplying by sin60°, which is sqrt(3)/2, gives (sqrt(3)/8)*(sqrt(3)/2) = 3/16.

So, the product sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° is 3/16.

Therefore, the original product, which is [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2, is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me think again. The original product is sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80° sin100° sin120° sin140° sin160°, which we rewrote as [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2 because sin100° = sin80°, sin120° = sin60°, etc. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the value of the product is 9/256.

But wait, let me check if I can find another way to compute this, just to confirm.

Alternatively, I can use the identity for the product of multiple sines. There's a formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles. The formula is:

Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)) = sqrt(n)/2^{n-1}

But in our case, the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°, which are 8 terms, each 20° apart. So, 20° = π/9 radians, 40° = 2π/9, up to 160° = 8π/9.

So, the product is Product_{k=1}^{8} sin(kπ/9). Wait, but the formula I mentioned earlier is for Product_{k=1}^{n-1} sin(kπ/(2n)). So, in our case, if we set 2n = 18, so n=9, then the product would be Product_{k=1}^{8} sin(kπ/18). But our product is Product_{k=1}^{8} sin(kπ/9). Hmm, that's different.

Wait, so maybe I need a different approach. Alternatively, I can use the identity for the product of sines in terms of multiple angles.

Alternatively, I can use complex numbers or roots of unity, but that might be more complicated.

Wait, another thought: since we have eight terms, and we've already paired them into four pairs, each pair being sinθ sin(180° - θ) = sin^2θ. So, the product becomes [sin20° sin40° sin60° sin80°]^2, which we've already computed as (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Alternatively, let me compute the product numerically to check.

Compute each sine:

sin20° ≈ 0.3420
sin40° ≈ 0.6428
sin60° ≈ 0.8660
sin80° ≈ 0.9848
sin100° ≈ 0.9848
sin120° ≈ 0.8660
sin140° ≈ 0.6428
sin160° ≈ 0.3420

Multiply them all together:

0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.2198
0.2198 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1903
0.1903 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1879
0.1879 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.1855
0.1855 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.1607
0.1607 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.1033
0.1033 * 0.3420 ≈ 0.0353

Wait, that's approximately 0.0353. Now, 9/256 is approximately 0.03515625, which is very close to 0.0353. So, that confirms that the exact value is 9/256.

Therefore, the value of the product is 9/256.
</think>

The product of the sines is calculated by recognizing the symmetry and using trigonometric identities. By pairing supplementary angles and applying the identity for the product of sines, we find the product simplifies to \(\left(\frac{3}{16}\right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}\).

"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out what shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates. The options are a line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. Hmm, okay, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point in space is defined by these three components.

The equation given is \( z = c \). That means, for any point on this shape, the z-coordinate is fixed at some constant value \( c \). So, regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is equal to \( c \), the point lies on this shape.

Let me visualize this. If I fix \( z = c \), what does that look like in 3D space? Well, in Cartesian coordinates, \( z = c \) would represent a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But since we're in cylindrical coordinates, does this change anything? I don't think so because the z-coordinate is the same in both systems. So, in cylindrical coordinates, \( z = c \) should still represent a plane.

Wait, but let me make sure. In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary freely as long as \( z \) is fixed. So, for any \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z = c \), the point is on the shape. That means it's a flat surface extending infinitely in the radial direction and around the z-axis. That definitely sounds like a plane.

Let me consider the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. A line would require two coordinates to be fixed, but here only \( z \) is fixed. A circle would have both \( r \) and \( \theta \) varying in a specific way, but here \( r \) can be anything. A sphere would require a relationship between \( r \), \( \theta \), and \( z \), which isn't the case here. A cylinder would have \( r \) fixed, but here \( r \) can vary. A cone would have \( z \) proportional to \( r \), but here \( z \) is fixed. So, none of these other options fit.

Therefore, I'm pretty confident that \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane. So, the correct answer should be (C) தளம்.
</think>

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates represents a plane because it fixes the height \( z \) while allowing \( r \) and \( \theta \) to vary freely. This corresponds to a flat, horizontal surface at height \( c \).

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible angle between two vectors a and b. I know their magnitudes: the norm of a is 2, and the norm of b is 7. Also, I'm given their cross product, which is the vector (3, 2, 6). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors has a magnitude equal to the product of their magnitudes times the sine of the angle between them. The formula is ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta), where theta is the angle between a and b. So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can solve for sin(theta), and then find theta.

Let me write that down:

||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta)

I have the cross product vector given as (3, 2, 6). To find its magnitude, I need to compute the square root of the sum of the squares of its components. So, that would be sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²). Let me calculate that:

3 squared is 9, 2 squared is 4, and 6 squared is 36. Adding those together: 9 + 4 + 36 = 49. So, the magnitude of the cross product is sqrt(49) which is 7.

Okay, so ||a × b|| = 7. Now, plugging into the formula:

7 = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta)

I know ||a|| is 2 and ||b|| is 7, so:

7 = 2 * 7 * sin(theta)

Simplify the right side: 2*7 is 14, so:

7 = 14 sin(theta)

Divide both sides by 14:

sin(theta) = 7 / 14 = 0.5

So, sin(theta) is 0.5. Now, I need to find theta such that its sine is 0.5. I remember that sin(30°) is 0.5, and sin(150°) is also 0.5. But since we're looking for the smallest possible angle between the vectors, it should be the acute angle, which is 30 degrees.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cross product magnitude gives me the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors, and the angle between them is related to how ""perpendicular"" they are. Since sin(theta) is 0.5, theta is either 30° or 150°, but the smallest angle is 30°, so that should be the answer.

Just to recap:

1. Compute ||a × b||: sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²) = 7
2. Use the cross product formula: ||a × b|| = ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta)
3. Plug in the values: 7 = 2*7*sin(theta) => sin(theta) = 0.5
4. Find theta: theta = 30°, since it's the smallest angle.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations. So, the smallest angle between a and b is 30 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)
\]
we substitute the known values:
\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin(\theta)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin(\theta) \implies \sin(\theta) = \frac{7}{14} = 0.5
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is 0.5 is either \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we need the smallest angle, we choose \(30^\circ\).

Thus, the smallest angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I'm given a function f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015, and another function g(x) which is defined as f(x + 5). I need to find the derivative of g, which is g'(x). Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that when you have a function like g(x) = f(x + 5), it's essentially a horizontal shift of the original function f(x). Specifically, shifting f(x) to the left by 5 units. But how does that affect the derivative? I think the chain rule comes into play here. The chain rule says that if you have a composite function, the derivative is the derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function times the derivative of the inner function. In this case, the outer function is f(u) where u = x + 5, and the inner function is u = x + 5.

So, applying the chain rule, g'(x) should be f'(u) * u', which is f'(x + 5) * 1, since the derivative of u = x + 5 with respect to x is just 1. That simplifies things a bit because I don't have to worry about multiplying by anything else; I just need to find f'(x) and then evaluate it at x + 5.

Alright, let's find f'(x). The function f(x) is a cubic polynomial, so its derivative should be straightforward. The derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative of -49x² is -98x, the derivative of 623x is 623, and the derivative of a constant like -2015 is 0. So putting that all together, f'(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623.

Now, since g'(x) = f'(x + 5), I need to substitute x + 5 into f'(x). That means wherever there's an x in f'(x), I replace it with (x + 5). Let's do that step by step.

First, substitute into the 3x² term: 3(x + 5)². Then, the -98x term becomes -98(x + 5). And the constant term remains 623. So, putting it all together, g'(x) = 3(x + 5)² - 98(x + 5) + 623.

Now, I need to expand this expression to simplify it. Let's start with the squared term: (x + 5)² is x² + 10x + 25. Multiplying that by 3 gives 3x² + 30x + 75.

Next, the -98(x + 5) term: distributing the -98 gives -98x - 490.

Now, let's combine all these parts together:

3x² + 30x + 75 - 98x - 490 + 623.

Now, let's combine like terms. The x² term is just 3x². For the x terms, 30x - 98x is -68x. For the constants, 75 - 490 + 623. Let's calculate that: 75 - 490 is -415, and -415 + 623 is 208.

So, putting it all together, g'(x) = 3x² - 68x + 208.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting with the expansion:

3(x + 5)² = 3(x² + 10x + 25) = 3x² + 30x + 75. That seems right.

-98(x + 5) = -98x - 490. Yep, that's correct.

Adding the constant term 623. So, combining all:

3x² + 30x + 75 - 98x - 490 + 623.

Now, combining x terms: 30x - 98x is indeed -68x.

Constants: 75 - 490 is -415, and -415 + 623 is 208. So, 3x² - 68x + 208. That looks correct.

Alternatively, I could have approached this problem by first expanding g(x) = f(x + 5) and then taking its derivative. Maybe that's a good way to verify my answer.

Let's try that. So, f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Therefore, f(x + 5) would be (x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let's compute each term:

First, (x + 5)³. Expanding that, it's x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, -49(x + 5)². First, (x + 5)² is x² + 10x + 25, so multiplying by -49 gives -49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, 623(x + 5) is 623x + 3115.

Finally, the constant term is -2015.

Now, let's combine all these terms:

(x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125) + (-49x² - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.

Let's combine like terms:

x³ term: x³.

x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².

x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, plus 623 is 208. So, 208x.

Constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Now, let's find the derivative of g(x). The derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative of -34x² is -68x, and the derivative of 208x is 208. So, g'(x) = 3x² - 68x + 208.

Wait, that's the same result as before! So, whether I use the chain rule directly on f'(x + 5) or expand g(x) first and then take the derivative, I end up with the same expression for g'(x). That gives me confidence that my answer is correct.

Just to be thorough, let me compute f'(x + 5) again step by step.

We had f'(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623.

So, f'(x + 5) = 3(x + 5)² - 98(x + 5) + 623.

Compute each term:

3(x + 5)² = 3(x² + 10x + 25) = 3x² + 30x + 75.

-98(x + 5) = -98x - 490.

Adding 623.

So, combining all terms:

3x² + 30x + 75 - 98x - 490 + 623.

Combine like terms:

3x².

30x - 98x = -68x.

75 - 490 + 623 = 208.

So, again, 3x² - 68x + 208.

Yep, same result. So, I think I'm solid here.

Alternatively, I could have also used the definition of the derivative, but that would be more complicated. The chain rule approach is much more straightforward.

Just to recap, the key steps were:

1. Recognize that g(x) is a horizontal shift of f(x), so its derivative can be found using the chain rule.
2. Compute f'(x) by differentiating term by term.
3. Substitute (x + 5) into f'(x) to get g'(x).
4. Expand and simplify the expression.
5. Alternatively, expand g(x) first by substituting (x + 5) into f(x), then differentiate term by term to verify the result.

Both methods led me to the same derivative, so I feel confident that g'(x) = 3x² - 68x + 208 is the correct answer.

I don't think I made any calculation errors, but just to be extra sure, let me plug in a value for x and check both f'(x + 5) and g'(x) to see if they match.

Let's choose x = 0.

First, compute f'(0 + 5) = f'(5). From f'(x) = 3x² - 98x + 623, so f'(5) = 3*(25) - 98*5 + 623 = 75 - 490 + 623 = (75 + 623) - 490 = 698 - 490 = 208.

Now, compute g'(0) from our derived expression: 3*(0)^2 - 68*(0) + 208 = 0 - 0 + 208 = 208. They match.

Let's try another value, say x = 1.

Compute f'(1 + 5) = f'(6). f'(6) = 3*(36) - 98*6 + 623 = 108 - 588 + 623 = (108 + 623) - 588 = 731 - 588 = 143.

Now, compute g'(1) = 3*(1)^2 - 68*(1) + 208 = 3 - 68 + 208 = (3 + 208) - 68 = 211 - 68 = 143. They match again.

One more check, x = 2.

f'(2 + 5) = f'(7). f'(7) = 3*(49) - 98*7 + 623 = 147 - 686 + 623 = (147 + 623) - 686 = 770 - 686 = 84.

g'(2) = 3*(4) - 68*(2) + 208 = 12 - 136 + 208 = (12 + 208) - 136 = 220 - 136 = 84. Perfect, matches again.

So, all these checks confirm that my derivative is correct. Therefore, I can confidently say that the derivative of g(x) is 3x² - 68x + 208.

**Final Answer**
The derivative of \( g \) is \boxed{3x^2 - 68x + 208}.

To find the derivative of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we use the chain rule. The chain rule states that the derivative of a composite function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) is \( g'(x) = f'(x + 5) \cdot 1 \), since the derivative of \( x + 5 \) with respect to \( x \) is 1.

First, we find the derivative of \( f(x) \):
\[
f'(x) = 3x^2 - 98x + 623

Next, we substitute \( x + 5 \) into \( f'(x) \):
\[
g'(x) = f'(x + 5) = 3(x + 5)^2 - 98(x + 5) + 623

Expanding and simplifying the expression:
\[
3(x + 5)^2 = 3(x^2 + 10x + 25) = 3x^2 + 30x + 75

"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that trigonometric identities often help simplify such expressions. Let me recall some identities that might be useful here. I know that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but perhaps I can relate these angles somehow. I notice that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, and 20° is double 10°, and 40° is double 20°. Maybe there's a pattern or a relationship here.

I also remember that \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\) and \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\). Maybe expressing everything in terms of tangent and cotangent could be useful. Let me try that:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Simplifying that, I get:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, so now I have 3 plus some tangent and cotangent squared terms. I wonder if I can find a relationship between these angles. Let me think about the angles: 10°, 20°, and 40°. I know that 10° + 20° + 40° = 70°, which isn't a standard angle, but maybe there's another relationship.

Wait, 10°, 20°, and 40° are all related through doubling. 20° is 2*10°, and 40° is 2*20°. Maybe I can use double-angle identities here. Let me recall that \(\tan 2\theta = \frac{2 \tan \theta}{1 - \tan^2 \theta}\) and \(\cot 2\theta = \frac{1 - \tan^2 \theta}{2 \tan \theta}\). Maybe I can express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(\tan 10^\circ\).

Let me denote \(t = \tan 10^\circ\). Then, \(\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\), and \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{2 \tan 20^\circ}{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ}\). But I'm dealing with cotangents, so let me express \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ\) in terms of \(t\).

Since \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}\), so:

\[
\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1 - t^2}{2t}
\]
\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \tan^2 20^\circ}{2 \tan 20^\circ}
\]

But \(\tan 20^\circ = \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\), so let's compute \(\tan^2 20^\circ\):

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{2t}{1 - t^2}\right)^2 = \frac{4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}
\]

Then, \(\cot 40^\circ\) becomes:

\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \frac{4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}}{2 \cdot \frac{2t}{1 - t^2}} = \frac{\frac{(1 - t^2)^2 - 4t^2}{(1 - t^2)^2}}{\frac{4t}{1 - t^2}} = \frac{(1 - 2t^2 + t^4 - 4t^2)}{(1 - t^2)^2} \cdot \frac{1 - t^2}{4t}
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
1 - 2t^2 + t^4 - 4t^2 = 1 - 6t^2 + t^4
\]

So,

\[
\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{(1 - t^2)^2} \cdot \frac{1 - t^2}{4t} = \frac{1 - 6t^2 + t^4}{(1 - t^2)(4t)}
\]

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe there's a better approach. Let me think about another identity or perhaps using complementary angles.

Wait, I remember that \(\sin \theta = \cos(90^\circ - \theta)\). So, \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). So, maybe I can rewrite the original expression in terms of cosines:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}
\]

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe I can relate these angles in another way. Let me think about the sum of angles: 10°, 50°, and 70°. Wait, 10° + 50° + 70° = 130°, which isn't particularly helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for the sum of secants squared. I recall that sometimes, when angles are in arithmetic progression, there are identities, but I'm not sure if that applies here.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the identity for \(\sec^2 \theta + \sec^2 (60^\circ - \theta) + \sec^2 (60^\circ + \theta)\). Let me check if that applies here.

But in our case, the angles are 10°, 20°, and 40°, which are not symmetric around 60°, so maybe that's not directly applicable.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\) and relate the cotangents. Let me try that.

So, starting again, the expression is:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Expressed as:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

So, I need to find \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). Maybe I can find a relationship between these terms.

Let me denote \(A = 10^\circ\), so \(2A = 20^\circ\), and \(4A = 40^\circ\). So, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 A + \cot^2 2A + \cot^2 4A
\]

I wonder if there's a telescoping identity or a recursive relationship here. Let me try to express \(\cot 2A\) and \(\cot 4A\) in terms of \(\tan A\).

We know that:

\[
\cot 2A = \frac{1 - \tan^2 A}{2 \tan A}
\]
\[
\cot 4A = \frac{1 - \tan^2 2A}{2 \tan 2A} = \frac{1 - \left(\frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}\right)^2}{2 \cdot \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}}
\]

Let me compute \(\cot 4A\):

First, compute \(\tan 2A = \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}\), so \(\tan^2 2A = \frac{4 \tan^2 A}{(1 - \tan^2 A)^2}\).

Then,

\[
\cot 4A = \frac{1 - \frac{4 \tan^2 A}{(1 - \tan^2 A)^2}}{2 \cdot \frac{2 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}} = \frac{\frac{(1 - \tan^2 A)^2 - 4 \tan^2 A}{(1 - \tan^2 A)^2}}{\frac{4 \tan A}{1 - \tan^2 A}} = \frac{(1 - 2 \tan^2 A + \tan^4 A - 4 \tan^2 A)}{(1 - \tan^2 A)^2} \cdot \frac{1 - \tan^2 A}{4 \tan A}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
1 - 2 \tan^2 A - 4 \tan^2 A + \tan^4 A = 1 - 6 \tan^2 A + \tan^4 A
\]

So,

\[
\cot 4A = \frac{1 - 6 \tan^2 A + \tan^4 A}{(1 - \tan^2 A)^2} \cdot \frac{1 - \tan^2 A}{4 \tan A} = \frac{1 - 6 \tan^2 A + \tan^4 A}{(1 - \tan^2 A)(4 \tan A)}
\]

Hmm, this is getting quite involved. Maybe instead of trying to express everything in terms of \(\tan A\), I can find a relationship between \(\tan^2 A\), \(\cot^2 2A\), and \(\cot^2 4A\).

Let me denote \(x = \tan^2 A\). Then, \(\cot^2 2A = \left(\frac{1 - x}{2 \sqrt{x}}\right)^2 = \frac{(1 - x)^2}{4x}\), assuming \(A\) is acute, which it is since it's 10°.

Similarly, \(\cot^2 4A\) can be expressed in terms of \(x\). Let me compute that.

From earlier, we have:

\[
\cot 4A = \frac{1 - 6x + x^2}{(1 - x)(4 \sqrt{x})}
\]

So, squaring both sides:

\[
\cot^2 4A = \frac{(1 - 6x + x^2)^2}{(1 - x)^2 \cdot 16x}
\]

This seems complicated, but maybe if I plug in \(x = \tan^2 10^\circ\), I can find a relationship. However, this might not be the most efficient way.

Wait, perhaps instead of trying to express everything in terms of \(x\), I can use the identity for the sum of squares of tangent and cotangent. Let me think.

I recall that \(\tan^2 \theta + \cot^2 \theta = \sec^2 \theta + \csc^2 \theta - 2\). Wait, is that correct? Let me verify:

\[
\tan^2 \theta + \cot^2 \theta = (\sec^2 \theta - 1) + (\csc^2 \theta - 1) = \sec^2 \theta + \csc^2 \theta - 2
\]

Yes, that's correct. So, maybe I can use this identity for some of the terms.

Looking back at my expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

I can group \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 10^\circ\) as one term, but I don't have \(\cot^2 10^\circ\). Alternatively, maybe I can relate \(\cot 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 70^\circ\), since \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\). Similarly, \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). So, let me rewrite the expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, now I have three tangent squared terms: 10°, 50°, and 70°. Maybe there's a known identity for the sum of squares of tangents at these angles.

I remember that in a triangle, the sum of angles is 180°, but 10°, 50°, and 70° add up to 130°, which isn't 180°, so that might not help.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the identity for \(\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C\) when A, B, C are angles of a triangle. But again, 10°, 50°, 70° don't form a triangle.

Alternatively, maybe using the identity for \(\tan^2 A + \tan^2 (60° - A) + \tan^2 (60° + A)\). Let me check if that","[70, '\\tan^2 A + \\tan^2 (60° - A) + \\tan^2 (60° + A)']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a convex polygon. It says that if we exclude one of its interior angles, the sum of all the other interior angles is 1070 degrees. I need to figure out how many sides the polygon has. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon depends on the number of sides it has. The formula for the sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2)*180 degrees. That's a key point. So, if I can find the total sum, I can solve for n.

But wait, the problem doesn't give me the total sum directly. It says that if we exclude one interior angle, the sum of the rest is 1070 degrees. So, the total sum would be 1070 degrees plus that one excluded angle. Let me denote the excluded angle as x. So, total sum S = 1070 + x.

But since it's a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than 180 degrees. That's an important property of convex polygons. So, x < 180 degrees. That means the total sum S is less than 1070 + 180, which is 1250 degrees. So, S < 1250.

On the other hand, the total sum S is also equal to (n-2)*180. So, (n-2)*180 = 1070 + x. Since x is less than 180, we can write (n-2)*180 < 1070 + 180, which simplifies to (n-2)*180 < 1250. Let me solve for n here.

Divide both sides by 180: (n-2) < 1250/180. Calculating 1250 divided by 180, let's see, 180*6=1080, 180*7=1260. So, 1250 is between 6 and 7 times 180. Specifically, 1250/180 ≈ 6.944. So, (n-2) < 6.944, which means n < 8.944. Since n must be an integer, n ≤ 8.

But wait, let's not jump to conclusions yet. Let's also consider the lower bound. The total sum S must be greater than 1070 because we're adding a positive angle x. So, (n-2)*180 > 1070. Let's solve for n here.

Divide both sides by 180: (n-2) > 1070/180. Calculating 1070 divided by 180, 180*5=900, 180*6=1080. So, 1070 is just a bit less than 6*180. Specifically, 1070/180 ≈ 5.944. So, (n-2) > 5.944, which means n > 7.944. Since n must be an integer, n ≥ 8.

Putting both inequalities together: n must be greater than approximately 7.944 and less than approximately 8.944. So, the only integer value n can take is 8. Therefore, the polygon has 8 sides.

But wait, let me double-check. If n=8, then the total sum S should be (8-2)*180 = 6*180 = 1080 degrees. The problem states that the sum of all but one angle is 1070, so the excluded angle x would be 1080 - 1070 = 10 degrees. Wait, that seems really small. Is 10 degrees a valid interior angle for a convex polygon?

Hmm, in a convex polygon, all interior angles must be less than 180 degrees, which 10 is, but also, each interior angle must be greater than 0 degrees. So, technically, 10 degrees is possible, but it's quite a sharp angle. Is there a reason to doubt this?

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in my calculations. Let me go through it again.

Total sum S = (n-2)*180.

Given that S = 1070 + x, where x < 180.

So, (n-2)*180 = 1070 + x.

We know that x must be positive, so (n-2)*180 > 1070.

Calculating 1070 / 180 ≈ 5.944, so n-2 > 5.944, so n > 7.944, so n=8.

Then, S = 6*180=1080, so x=1080-1070=10 degrees.

Is 10 degrees acceptable? Well, in a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than 180, which it is, but also, the polygon must be simple (non-intersecting sides) and all vertices must point outward. A 10-degree angle is very sharp, but mathematically, it's still a convex polygon as long as all angles are less than 180.

Alternatively, maybe the problem expects a different approach. Let me think.

Wait, another way to approach this is to consider that the sum of interior angles is (n-2)*180. If we remove one angle, the sum becomes 1070. So, (n-2)*180 - x = 1070, where x is the excluded angle.

But since x must be less than 180, we have (n-2)*180 - 1070 < 180.

So, (n-2)*180 < 1070 + 180 = 1250.

Which again gives n < 8.944, so n=8.

Alternatively, maybe I can set up the equation as (n-2)*180 = 1070 + x, and since x < 180, then (n-2)*180 must be between 1070 and 1250.

So, 1070 < (n-2)*180 < 1250.

Divide all parts by 180:

1070/180 < n-2 < 1250/180

Which is approximately 5.944 < n-2 < 6.944

So, n-2 must be between approximately 5.944 and 6.944, meaning n-2=6, so n=8.

Yes, that confirms it again. So, n=8.

But just to be thorough, let's check if n=8 makes sense. Sum of interior angles is 6*180=1080. If we exclude one angle, the sum is 1070, so the excluded angle is 10 degrees. As I thought earlier, it's a very sharp angle, but still valid for a convex polygon.

Alternatively, if n were 9, the total sum would be 7*180=1260. Then, the excluded angle would be 1260-1070=190 degrees, which is more than 180, making the polygon concave, which contradicts the given that it's convex. So, n cannot be 9.

Similarly, if n were 7, the total sum would be 5*180=900. Then, the excluded angle would be 900-1070=-170, which is negative, which doesn't make sense. So, n can't be 7.

Therefore, the only possible value is n=8.

So, the polygon has 8 sides.

The polygon has 8 sides.

"Alright, so I have this problem here: I need to find a unique odd integer t such that 0 < t < 23, and t + 2 is congruent to t modulo 23. Hmm, okay, let me try to unpack this step by step.

First, let's make sure I understand the problem correctly. We have an integer t that's between 0 and 23, not including 0 and 23. So t is in the range 1 to 22. Also, t is an odd integer, which means it can't be even. So possible values for t are 1, 3, 5, ..., up to 21.

Now, the condition given is that t + 2 is congruent to t modulo 23. In mathematical terms, that's written as t + 2 ≡ t (mod 23). I need to find the value of t that satisfies this condition.

Let me write that equation down:

t + 2 ≡ t (mod 23)

Hmm, if I subtract t from both sides, what do I get? Let's see:

t + 2 - t ≡ t - t (mod 23)

Simplifying both sides:

2 ≡ 0 (mod 23)

Wait, that can't be right. 2 is not congruent to 0 modulo 23 because 23 doesn't divide 2. So does that mean there's no solution? But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t that satisfies this condition. Maybe I made a mistake in my reasoning.

Let me think again. The equation is t + 2 ≡ t (mod 23). If I subtract t from both sides, I get 2 ≡ 0 (mod 23), which is not true. So does that mean there's no solution? But the problem states that such a t exists. Maybe I'm interpreting the problem incorrectly.

Wait, let me read the problem again: ""0 < t < 23 and t + 2 is congruent to t modulo 23."" So t is an integer between 1 and 22, odd, and t + 2 ≡ t mod 23.

But as I saw earlier, subtracting t from both sides gives 2 ≡ 0 mod 23, which is impossible. So does that mean there's no solution? But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is not about modular congruence but something else? Wait, no, the problem clearly states ""t + 2 is congruent to t modulo 23."" So it's definitely a modular congruence.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the notation. Let me recall that a ≡ b mod m means that m divides (a - b). So in this case, t + 2 ≡ t mod 23 means that 23 divides (t + 2 - t), which simplifies to 23 divides 2. But 23 doesn't divide 2 because 23 is a prime number and 2 is less than 23. So that would mean there's no solution.

But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Maybe I'm misapplying the modular arithmetic here. Let me think differently. Perhaps the problem is not about t + 2 being congruent to t mod 23, but rather that t + 2 is congruent to t mod something else? Wait, no, the problem clearly states mod 23.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to interpret it differently. Let me consider that t + 2 is congruent to t mod 23, which would mean that t + 2 - t is a multiple of 23. So 2 is a multiple of 23, which is not possible. Therefore, there is no solution. But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Hmm, this is confusing.

Wait, perhaps the problem is written incorrectly? Or maybe I'm misinterpreting the condition. Let me read it again: ""t + 2 is congruent to t modulo 23."" So t + 2 ≡ t (mod 23). As I saw, this simplifies to 2 ≡ 0 mod 23, which is false. Therefore, there is no such t. But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Maybe I'm missing something.

Wait, perhaps the problem is not about t + 2 being congruent to t mod 23, but rather that t + 2 is congruent to t mod something else, like mod 2? But that doesn't make sense because mod 2 would just check if t + 2 and t have the same parity, which they do because adding 2 doesn't change parity. But that's trivial and doesn't help us find t.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is about t + 2 being congruent to t mod 23 in a different sense, like in a different modulus. Wait, no, the problem clearly states mod 23.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let's try plugging in the possible odd values of t and see if any satisfy t + 2 ≡ t mod 23.

So t can be 1, 3, 5, ..., 21.

Let's try t = 1: 1 + 2 = 3. Is 3 ≡ 1 mod 23? 3 - 1 = 2, which is not a multiple of 23. So no.

t = 3: 3 + 2 = 5. 5 ≡ 3 mod 23? 5 - 3 = 2, not a multiple of 23. No.

t = 5: 5 + 2 = 7. 7 - 5 = 2. No.

t = 7: 7 + 2 = 9. 9 - 7 = 2. No.

t = 9: 9 + 2 = 11. 11 - 9 = 2. No.

t = 11: 11 + 2 = 13. 13 - 11 = 2. No.

t = 13: 13 + 2 = 15. 15 - 13 = 2. No.

t = 15: 15 + 2 = 17. 17 - 15 = 2. No.

t = 17: 17 + 2 = 19. 19 - 17 = 2. No.

t = 19: 19 + 2 = 21. 21 - 19 = 2. No.

t = 21: 21 + 2 = 23. Now, 23 mod 23 is 0. So 23 ≡ 0 mod 23. But t is 21, so 21 + 2 = 23 ≡ 0 mod 23. But the condition is t + 2 ≡ t mod 23, which would mean 0 ≡ 21 mod 23. Is 0 ≡ 21 mod 23? That would mean 21 is a multiple of 23, which it's not. So no.

Wait, so none of the odd t values satisfy t + 2 ≡ t mod 23. That's strange because the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the problem.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that t + 2 is congruent to t mod 23, but in the sense that t + 2 is congruent to t mod 23, which would mean that t + 2 - t is a multiple of 23, i.e., 2 is a multiple of 23, which is impossible. Therefore, there is no solution. But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Maybe the problem is misstated.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that t + 2 is congruent to t mod something else, like mod 2, but that's trivial. Or maybe it's a different modulus. Wait, the problem says mod 23, so that's fixed.

Wait, maybe I'm supposed to interpret it as t + 2 ≡ t mod 23, which would mean that 2 ≡ 0 mod 23, which is false, so no solution. But the problem says there is a unique odd integer t. Maybe the problem is miswritten, or perhaps I'm misinterpreting it.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of the number 5 plus the square root of 3 and its conjugate. Hmm, okay, let me think about what that means. First, I remember that a conjugate of a binomial expression like a + b is a - b. So, in this case, the conjugate of 5 + √3 should be 5 - √3. That makes sense because the conjugate just changes the sign between the two terms.

Now, the problem is asking for the product of these two expressions: (5 + √3) and (5 - √3). I think this is a difference of squares situation. The formula for the product of a binomial and its conjugate is (a + b)(a - b) = a² - b². So, applying that here, I can let a be 5 and b be √3.

Let me write that out step by step. First, square the first term, which is 5. So, 5 squared is 25. Then, square the second term, which is √3. The square of √3 is just 3 because (√3)² = 3. So, putting it all together, the product should be 25 minus 3, which is 22.

Wait, let me double-check that. If I multiply (5 + √3) by (5 - √3), I can use the distributive property to make sure. Let's do that:

First, multiply 5 by 5, which is 25. Then, 5 times -√3 is -5√3. Next, √3 times 5 is 5√3. Finally, √3 times -√3 is - (√3)², which is -3. So, adding all those up: 25 - 5√3 + 5√3 - 3. The -5√3 and +5√3 cancel each other out, leaving 25 - 3, which is indeed 22. Okay, that checks out.

I think I got it right. So, the product of 5 + √3 and its conjugate is 22. That makes sense because when you multiply a binomial by its conjugate, the result is always a difference of squares, which eliminates the radical term. So, in this case, the √3 terms cancel each other out, leaving a simple integer.

Just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes, let me go through the multiplication again:

(5 + √3)(5 - √3) = 5*5 + 5*(-√3) + √3*5 + √3*(-√3)
= 25 - 5√3 + 5√3 - (√3)^2
= 25 - 5√3 + 5√3 - 3
= 25 - 3
= 22

Yep, that's consistent. So, I feel confident that the answer is 22. I don't think I made any calculation errors here. It's a straightforward application of the conjugate multiplication rule.

Another way to think about it is that the product of a number and its conjugate gives the square of the first term minus the square of the second term. Since 5 squared is 25 and (√3) squared is 3, subtracting those gives 22. That's another way to remember it without having to go through the entire distribution each time.

I guess the key takeaway here is recognizing when you have a conjugate pair and knowing that their product simplifies to a difference of squares. It's a useful shortcut, especially when dealing with more complex expressions or when trying to rationalize denominators. But in this case, it's pretty straightforward.

So, just to recap: the conjugate of 5 + √3 is 5 - √3. Multiplying them together using the difference of squares formula gives 25 - 3, which is 22. I've verified it through distribution and by recognizing the pattern, so I'm pretty sure that's the correct answer.

I don't think there's anything else to it. It's a good problem for practicing conjugate multiplication and understanding how radicals can be eliminated from expressions. It also reinforces the importance of knowing algebraic identities, like the difference of squares, which can simplify calculations a lot.

In summary, the product of 5 + √3 and its conjugate is 22. I've checked it multiple ways, and each time I get the same result, so I'm confident that's the right answer.

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) are inverse trigonometric functions. I also recall that \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is the same as \(\tan^{-1}(1/x)\), right? So maybe I can rewrite the equation using that identity. Let me check: yes, \(\cot^{-1}(x) = \tan^{-1}(1/x)\). So in this case, \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) would be \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, is that correct? Let me think. If I have \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\), then substituting \(x\) with \(1/x\), it becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x)\). So, yes, that seems right.

So, substituting that into the original equation, I get:

\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Which simplifies to:

\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Okay, so now I have \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = 1/3\). I need to find all \(x\) that satisfy this equation.

I remember that there's a double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). Maybe I can use that here. Let me set \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). So, substituting back, I have:

\[
2 \sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) \cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, I need to find expressions for \(\sin(\tan^{-1}(x))\) and \(\cos(\tan^{-1}(x))\). I remember that if \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\tan \theta = x\), which means we can think of a right triangle where the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse would be \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\).

Therefore, \(\sin(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos(\tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Substituting these back into the equation:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

So, that gives:

\[
\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Now, I can cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):

\[
2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)
\]
\[
6x = x^2 + 1
\]

Bringing all terms to one side:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). I can solve this using the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}
\]

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

But wait, I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be restrictions on the domain or range.

Let me recall the domains and ranges:

- \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is defined for all real numbers \(x\), and its range is \((- \pi/2, \pi/2)\).
- \(\cot^{-1}(x)\) is also defined for all real numbers \(x\), and its range is \((0, \pi)\).

But in our case, we have \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\). So, if \(x\) is positive, then \(1/x\) is positive, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) will be in \((0, \pi/2)\). Similarly, if \(x\) is negative, \(1/x\) is negative, and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\) will be in \((\pi/2, \pi)\).

But since we have \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\), let's see if the sum of these two angles is within the domain where sine is defined. The sine function is defined for all real numbers, so that shouldn't be a problem.

But let me verify the solutions by plugging them back into the original equation.

First, let's take \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Let me compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(1/x)\).

But actually, since we already used identities to simplify the equation, and the quadratic solution is straightforward, I think these solutions are valid. However, just to be thorough, let me compute the left side of the original equation with \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).

Compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\):

Let me denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(3 + 2\sqrt{2})\). Then, \(\tan \theta = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). I know that \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is actually \(\tan(75^\circ)\) because \(\tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{3}/3}{1 - \sqrt{3}/3} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{3})^2}{9 - 3} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{6} = \frac{12 + 6\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2 + \sqrt{3}\). Wait, that's not \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is \(\tan(67.5^\circ)\) because \(\tan(45^\circ + 22.5^\circ)\). Let me compute that:

\[
\tan(45^\circ + 22.5^\circ) = \frac{\tan 45^\circ + \tan 22.5^\circ}{1 - \tan 45^\circ \tan 22.5^\circ} = \frac{1 + \tan 22.5^\circ}{1 - \tan 22.5^\circ}
\]

I know that \(\tan 22.5^\circ = \sqrt{2} - 1\), so plugging that in:

\[
\frac{1 + (\sqrt{2} - 1)}{1 - (\sqrt{2} - 1)} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2 - \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}(2 + \sqrt{2})}{(2 - \sqrt{2})(2 + \sqrt{2})} = \frac{2\sqrt{2} + 2}{4 - 2} = \frac{2\sqrt{2} + 2}{2} = \sqrt{2} + 1
\]

Wait, that's \(\sqrt{2} + 1\), which is approximately 2.414, but \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is approximately 5.828. Hmm, so maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, perhaps \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is \(\tan(75^\circ)\). Let me check:

\[
\tan(75^\circ) = \tan(45^\circ + 30^\circ) = \frac{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}}{1 - 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}} = \frac{\frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3}}{\frac{3 - \sqrt{3}}{3}} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{3}}{3 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{(3 + \sqrt{3})^2}{9 - 3} = \frac{9 + 6\sqrt{3} + 3}{6} = \frac{12 + 6\sqrt{3}}{6} = 2 + \sqrt{3}
\]

Which is approximately 3.732, which is still less than 5.828. Hmm, so maybe \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is a different angle. Alternatively, perhaps it's better not to compute the exact angle but to just proceed with the algebra.

Alternatively, let me compute \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x))\) for \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\). From earlier, we have:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}
\]

So plugging \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\):

First, compute \(x^2\):

\[
(3 + 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 + 12\sqrt{2}
\]

So, \(x^2 + 1 = 17 + 12\sqrt{2} + 1 = 18 + 12\sqrt{2}\)

Then, \(2x = 2(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}\)

So, \(\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{6 + 4\sqrt{2}}{18 + 12\sqrt{2}}\)

Let me rationalize the denominator:

Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \(18 - 12\sqrt{2}\):

\[
\frac{(6 + 4\sqrt{2})(18 - 12\sqrt{2})}{(18 + 12\sqrt{2})(18 - 12\sqrt{2})}
\]

First, compute the denominator:

\[
18^2 - (12\sqrt{2})^2 = 324 - 144 \cdot 2 = 324 - 288 = 36
\]

Now, compute the numerator:

\[
6 \cdot 18 + 6 \cdot (-12\sqrt{2}) + 4\sqrt{2} \cdot 18 + 4\sqrt{2} \cdot (-12\sqrt{2})
\]
\[
= 108 - 72\sqrt{2} + 72\sqrt{2} - 48 \cdot 2
\]
\[
= 108 - 72\sqrt{2} + 72\sqrt{2} - 96
\]
\[
= (108 - 96) + (-72\sqrt{2} + 72\sqrt{2})
\]
\[
= 12 + 0 = 12
\]

So, the numerator is 12 and the denominator is 36, so the fraction is \(12/36 = 1/3\). That's correct, so \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) is a valid solution.

Now, let's check \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Let's compute \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x))\) again using the same formula:

\[
\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{2x}{x^2 + 1}
\]

Compute \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\):

First, \(x^2 = (3 - 2\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 - 12\sqrt{2} + 8 = 17 - 12\sqrt{2}\)

So, \(x^2 + 1 = 17 - 12\sqrt{2} + 1 = 18 - 12\sqrt{2}\)

Then, \(2x = 2(3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 6 - 4\sqrt{2}\)

So, \(\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{6 - 4\sqrt{2}}{18 - 12\sqrt{2}}\)

Again, rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by the conjugate \(18 + 12\sqrt{2}\):

\[
\frac{(6 - 4\sqrt{2})(18 + 12\sqrt{2})}{(18 - 12\sqrt{2})(18 + 12\sqrt{2})}

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the distance between two skew lines. Hmm, skew lines... I remember they are lines that don't intersect and aren't parallel, right? So, they exist in different planes. The problem gives me two parametric equations of lines, and I need to find the shortest distance between them.

Let me write down the given lines first to get a clear picture.

The first line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
So, in parametric form, this can be written as:
- \( x = 3 + 2t \)
- \( y = -10 - 9t \)
- \( z = 1 - 2t \)

The second line is:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Which translates to:
- \( x = -5 + 4u \)
- \( y = -3 - 18u \)
- \( z = 6 - 4u \)

Okay, so both lines are given in vector form with parameters t and u. Since they are skew lines, they don't intersect, and their direction vectors aren't scalar multiples of each other. Let me check the direction vectors to confirm they aren't parallel.

The direction vector of the first line is \( \mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \) and the second line is \( \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} \). Hmm, I notice that \( \mathbf{d_2} \) is exactly 2 times \( \mathbf{d_1} \). Wait, 2*2=4, 2*(-9)=-18, 2*(-2)=-4. So, actually, they are scalar multiples. That means the lines are parallel, not skew. But the problem says they are skew lines. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, no, hold on. If the direction vectors are scalar multiples, then the lines are either parallel or coincident. But since the problem says they are skew, that must mean they are parallel but not coincident. So, they don't intersect, which is why they are skew. So, okay, that makes sense.

But wait, actually, in three-dimensional space, if two lines are parallel, they can either be coincident or skew. Since they are given as skew, they must be parallel but not coincident. So, that's correct.

Now, to find the distance between two parallel lines, I remember that the distance is the length of the vector connecting any two points on the lines, projected onto the direction perpendicular to both lines. Since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors are the same (or scalar multiples), so the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line can be used to find the distance.

Let me recall the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. It's the magnitude of the cross product of the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line and the direction vector, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector.

Wait, actually, the formula is:

Distance = \( \frac{|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}|}{|\mathbf{v}|} \)

Where \( \mathbf{v} \) is the direction vector of the lines, and \( \mathbf{w} \) is the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line.

So, let me define points on each line. Let's take t=0 on the first line and u=0 on the second line for simplicity.

Point on first line when t=0: \( A = (3, -10, 1) \)
Point on second line when u=0: \( B = (-5, -3, 6) \)

So, vector \( \mathbf{AB} = B - A = (-5 - 3, -3 - (-10), 6 - 1) = (-8, 7, 5) \)

The direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \) is \( \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Now, compute the cross product \( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} \).

Let me compute that:

\( \mathbf{AB} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \)
\( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \)

Cross product formula:
\( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} (7)(-2) - (5)(-9) \\ (5)(2) - (-8)(-2) \\ (-8)(-9) - (7)(2) \end{pmatrix} \)

Calculating each component:

First component: \( 7*(-2) = -14 \), \( 5*(-9) = -45 \), so \( -14 - (-45) = -14 + 45 = 31 \)

Second component: \( 5*2 = 10 \), \( (-8)*(-2) = 16 \), so \( 10 - 16 = -6 \)

Third component: \( (-8)*(-9) = 72 \), \( 7*2 = 14 \), so \( 72 - 14 = 58 \)

So, \( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix} \)

Now, find the magnitude of this cross product:

\( |\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} \)

Calculating each term:

31^2 = 961

(-6)^2 = 36

58^2 = 3364

Adding them up: 961 + 36 = 997; 997 + 3364 = 4361

So, \( |\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{4361} \)

Now, find the magnitude of the direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \):

\( |\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89} \)

So, the distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} \)

Simplify this:

\( \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} \)

Let me compute 4361 divided by 89.

89*49 = 4361 because 89*50=4450, which is 89 more than 4361, so 4450 - 89 = 4361, so 89*49=4361.

So, \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \)

Therefore, the distance is 7 units.

Wait, that seems straightforward. Let me double-check my steps.

1. Identified the lines as parallel because direction vectors are scalar multiples.
2. Took points A and B on each line when parameters are zero.
3. Computed vector AB as (-8,7,5).
4. Cross product of AB and direction vector v gave (31, -6, 58).
5. Magnitude of cross product is sqrt(31² + (-6)² +58²) = sqrt(961 + 36 + 3364) = sqrt(4361).
6. Magnitude of direction vector v is sqrt(4 + 81 +4) = sqrt(89).
7. Divided sqrt(4361) by sqrt(89) to get sqrt(49) =7.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the distance between the two lines is 7 units.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the two skew lines is \boxed{7}.
</think>

The given problem involves finding the distance between two skew lines. The lines are given in parametric form:

First line:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Second line:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We observe that the direction vectors of both lines are scalar multiples of each other, confirming they are parallel. To find the distance between these parallel lines, we use the formula involving the cross product of the vector connecting a point on each line and the direction vector.

Points on the lines when parameters are zero:
- Point \( A = (3, -10, 1) \) on the first line.
- Point \( B = (-5, -3, 6) \) on the second line.

Vector \( \mathbf{AB} \) connecting these points:
\[
\mathbf{AB} = B - A = (-8, 7, 5)
\]

Direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \):
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Cross product \( \mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} \):
\[
\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Magnitude of the cross product:
\[
|\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

Magnitude of the direction vector \( \mathbf{v} \):
\[
|\mathbf{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Distance between the lines:
\[
\frac{|\mathbf{AB} \times \mathbf{v}|}{|\mathbf{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

So, these four points form a rectangle. Let me plot them mentally. The points (5,4) and (-5,4) are on the same horizontal line y=4, and similarly, (5,-4) and (-5,-4) are on y=-4. So, the rectangle is symmetric about both the x-axis and y-axis because the coordinates are mirrored across both axes. 

First, I should figure out the dimensions of this rectangle. The length along the x-axis can be found by looking at the x-coordinates of the points. The leftmost point is (-5,4) and the rightmost is (5,4), so the width is from -5 to 5, which is a total of 10 units. Similarly, the height is from y=-4 to y=4, which is 8 units. So, the rectangle is 10 units wide and 8 units tall.

Now, the question is about the number of lattice points inside this rectangle. Lattice points are points with integer coordinates. So, I need to count all the integer coordinate points (x, y) such that x and y are integers, and the point lies strictly inside the rectangle.

Wait, hold on. The problem says ""இந்த செவ்வகப் பகுதியின் உள்பகுதியில் முழு எண் இணக்கமான எத்தனை புள்ளிகள் இருக்கும்?"" which translates to ""How many integer coordinate points are inside this rectangular region?"" So, it's the interior points, not including the boundary.

But sometimes, in some contexts, people might include the boundary. Hmm, but the problem specifically says ""உள்பகுதி"" which means interior. So, I should count only the points strictly inside the rectangle.

So, to find the number of interior lattice points, I can use the formula related to Pick's Theorem, but maybe it's simpler to calculate it directly.

Pick's Theorem states that for a simple polygon whose vertices are lattice points, the area A is equal to I + B/2 - 1, where I is the number of interior lattice points and B is the number of boundary lattice points. But since I don't know B yet, maybe it's easier to compute I directly.

Alternatively, I can compute the number of interior points by considering the grid.

Since the rectangle is from x = -5 to x = 5 and y = -4 to y = 4, but we need points strictly inside, so x must be from -4 to 4 and y must be from -3 to 3. Because the boundary is at x = ±5 and y = ±4, so the interior points can't be on those lines.

Wait, let me think again. The rectangle is defined by the four points given, so the sides are vertical lines at x = -5 and x = 5, and horizontal lines at y = -4 and y = 4. So, the interior points must satisfy -5 < x < 5 and -4 < y < 4.

But x and y must be integers. So, x can be integers from -4 to 4 inclusive, because -5 < x < 5 means x can be -4, -3, ..., 3, 4. Similarly, y can be integers from -3 to 3 inclusive, because -4 < y < 4 means y can be -3, -2, ..., 2, 3.

So, the number of possible x-values is from -4 to 4, which is 9 values (since 4 - (-4) + 1 = 9). Similarly, the number of possible y-values is from -3 to 3, which is 7 values.

Therefore, the total number of interior lattice points is 9 * 7 = 63.

Wait, let me verify this. If x ranges from -4 to 4, inclusive, that's 9 integers: -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Similarly, y ranges from -3 to 3, inclusive, which is 7 integers: -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3. So, 9 * 7 = 63. That seems correct.

Alternatively, if I use Pick's Theorem, let's see if I get the same result. First, compute the area of the rectangle. The width is 10 units (from -5 to 5) and the height is 8 units (from -4 to 4), so area A = 10 * 8 = 80.

Now, compute the number of boundary points B. The boundary consists of the four sides. Each side is a line segment between two vertices.

First, the top side from (-5,4) to (5,4). The number of lattice points on this line segment is the number of integer x from -5 to 5, inclusive, with y=4. So, that's 11 points (from x=-5 to x=5). Similarly, the bottom side from (-5,-4) to (5,-4) also has 11 points.

Now, the left side from (-5,4) to (-5,-4). The number of lattice points here is the number of integer y from 4 to -4, inclusive. That's 9 points (y=4,3,2,1,0,-1,-2,-3,-4). Similarly, the right side from (5,4) to (5,-4) also has 9 points.

But wait, the four corners are counted twice in this method. Each corner is shared by two sides. So, total boundary points B = 11 (top) + 11 (bottom) + 9 (left) + 9 (right) - 4 (corners counted twice) = 11+11+9+9 -4 = 40 -4 = 36.

So, B = 36.

Now, using Pick's Theorem: A = I + B/2 - 1.

We have A = 80, B = 36.

So, 80 = I + 36/2 - 1 => 80 = I + 18 -1 => 80 = I +17 => I = 80 -17 = 63.

So, that confirms the earlier result. Therefore, the number of interior lattice points is 63.

I think that's solid. Both methods give the same answer, so I'm confident it's 63.
</think>

The number of interior lattice points inside the rectangle is calculated by considering the integer coordinates strictly within the boundaries. The rectangle spans from x = -5 to x = 5 and y = -4 to y = 4. Excluding the boundaries, the x-values range from -4 to 4 (9 values) and y-values from -3 to 3 (7 values). Multiplying these gives 9 * 7 = 63 interior points. This is confirmed using Pick's Theorem, yielding the same result.

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) cross (3c + a). I'm given the cross products of a, b, and c with each other: a cross b, a cross c, and b cross c. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product is distributive over vector addition, which means I can expand the expression (2b - a) cross (3c + a) using the distributive property. So, let me write that out:

(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a.

Wait, hold on, I think I need to be careful with the coefficients. The cross product is bilinear, so I can factor out the scalars. So, actually, it should be:

= 2 * 3 * (b × c) + 2 * (b × a) - 3 * (a × c) - (a × a).

Simplifying the coefficients:

= 6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c) - (a × a).

Now, I know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so a × a = 0. That term drops out. So now we have:

= 6(b × c) + 2(b × a) - 3(a × c).

Next, I recall that the cross product is anti-commutative, meaning that b × a = - (a × b). Similarly, a × c = - (c × a). Wait, but in our case, we have a × c, which is given, so maybe I can express everything in terms of the given cross products.

Let me write down the given cross products:

a × b = [6, -7, 3],
a × c = [4, 7, 2],
b × c = [1, -7, 18].

So, let's substitute these into our expression.

First, 6(b × c) is straightforward: 6 times [1, -7, 18] which is [6*1, 6*(-7), 6*18] = [6, -42, 108].

Next, 2(b × a). But b × a is equal to - (a × b). So, 2(b × a) = 2*(- (a × b)) = -2*(a × b). Since a × b is [6, -7, 3], multiplying by -2 gives [-12, 14, -6].

Then, -3(a × c). We have a × c as [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6].

Now, let's add all these together:

First vector: [6, -42, 108],
Second vector: [-12, 14, -6],
Third vector: [-12, -21, -6].

Adding them component-wise:

For the x-component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) = 6 - 12 -12 = 6 -24 = -18.

For the y-component: -42 + 14 + (-21) = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49.

For the z-component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) = 108 -6 -6 = 108 -12 = 96.

So, putting it all together, the cross product (2b - a) × (3c + a) is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting with 6(b × c): 6*1=6, 6*(-7)=-42, 6*18=108. That seems right.

Then, 2(b × a) = 2*(-a × b) = -2*[6, -7, 3] = [-12, 14, -6]. Correct.

-3(a × c) = -3*[4,7,2] = [-12, -21, -6]. That's correct.

Adding them up:

x: 6 -12 -12 = -18.

y: -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49.

z: 108 -6 -6 = 96.

Yes, that seems consistent. So, the final result is [-18, -49, 96].

I think that's it. I don't see any errors in my steps. I expanded the cross product correctly, substituted the given values, and performed the arithmetic accurately. So, I'm confident that the answer is [-18, -49, 96].

**Final Answer**
The cross product is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

To find the cross product \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we start by expanding the expression using the distributive property of the cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Simplifying the coefficients and using the properties of the cross product, we get:

\[
= 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a})
\]

Since \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 0\), this term drops out. We also use the anti-commutative property of the cross product, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})\). Substituting the given cross products:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We substitute these into our expression:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (- (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b})) = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Adding these results component-wise:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Thus, the cross product is \(\boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}\).","[Matrix([

"Alright, so I have this problem about a quadrilateral ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. It's given that ABCD is a trapezoid because it has a pair of parallel sides. Also, it's mentioned that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects the angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid ABCD is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD.

First, let me try to visualize the trapezoid. Since AD is parallel to BC, and it's a trapezoid, sides AB and CD must be the non-parallel sides. Now, AC is one of the diagonals, and it's perpendicular to CD. That's interesting because it gives us a right angle at the intersection of AC and CD.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. That tells me that point C is positioned such that when you draw diagonal AC, it splits angle BAD into two equal parts. This might be useful in applying some angle bisector theorem or properties related to similar triangles.

Let me denote some variables. Let me assume that AB is the top base and CD is the bottom base of the trapezoid, with AD and BC being the legs. Wait, but actually, since AD is parallel to BC, that would mean AD and BC are the two bases. So, AB and CD are the legs. Hmm, that might complicate things a bit because usually, in trapezoids, the bases are the two parallel sides, so AD and BC are the bases here.

Wait, hold on. Let me clarify: in a trapezoid, the two sides that are parallel are called the bases. So, if AD is parallel to BC, then AD and BC are the bases. Therefore, AB and CD are the non-parallel sides, called the legs. So, the trapezoid has bases AD and BC, and legs AB and CD.

Given that AC is perpendicular to CD, so AC ⊥ CD. That means at point C, the diagonal AC meets CD at a right angle. So, triangle ACD is a right triangle with right angle at C.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAD as 2θ, so each of the angles BAC and CAD is θ.

Since ABCD is a trapezoid with AD || BC, the consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So, angle BAD + angle ADC = 180 degrees. But since AC is perpendicular to CD, angle ACD is 90 degrees. Hmm, maybe I can use some trigonometric relationships here.

Let me try to assign some coordinates to the points to make this more concrete. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and AC is perpendicular to CD, maybe I can set up the coordinates such that calculations are easier.

Let me assume that AD is along the x-axis. So, point A is at (0,0), and point D is at (d,0) for some d > 0. Since AD is parallel to BC, point B must be somewhere above A, and point C must be somewhere above D such that BC is parallel to AD.

But wait, AC is perpendicular to CD. So, if I have point C somewhere, then the line AC must be perpendicular to CD. Let me think about how to place the points.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to use vectors or coordinate geometry here. Let me try coordinate geometry.

Let me place point A at (0,0). Let me let AD be along the x-axis, so point D is at (a,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, point B must be at some point (b,c), and point C must be at (a + b, c) because BC is parallel to AD, which is along the x-axis. So, the vector from B to C is the same as the vector from A to D, which is (a,0). So, if B is at (b,c), then C is at (b + a, c).

Now, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(b + a, c). The slope of AC is (c - 0)/(b + a - 0) = c/(a + b). The slope of CD is (c - 0)/(b + a - a) = c/b. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the product of their slopes should be -1.

So, (c/(a + b)) * (c/b) = -1.

So, (c^2)/(b(a + b)) = -1.

But since c^2 is positive, and b(a + b) is positive (assuming all lengths are positive), this would imply that the product is positive, but it's equal to -1, which is negative. That can't be. Hmm, maybe I made a mistake in assigning coordinates.

Wait, perhaps I should have considered the direction of the slopes. If AC is perpendicular to CD, then the product of their slopes is -1. But if AC is going from A(0,0) to C(b + a, c), and CD is going from C(b + a, c) to D(a,0). So, the slope of CD is (0 - c)/(a - (b + a)) = (-c)/(-b) = c/b. The slope of AC is c/(a + b). So, their product is (c/(a + b))*(c/b) = c^2/(b(a + b)).

Setting this equal to -1: c^2/(b(a + b)) = -1. But c^2 is positive, and b(a + b) is positive (assuming b and a are positive lengths). So, positive equals negative, which is impossible. That suggests that my coordinate system might be flawed.

Wait, maybe I should have placed point D at (d,0) and point C at (c, h), but I need to ensure that BC is parallel to AD. Hmm, perhaps I need a different approach.

Alternatively, maybe I should consider the properties of the trapezoid and the angle bisector.

Since AC bisects angle BAD, which is 2θ, and AC is perpendicular to CD, which is a leg. So, in triangle ACD, which is a right triangle, angle at C is 90 degrees, angle at A is θ, so angle at D is 90 - θ.

Similarly, in triangle ABC, which is not necessarily a right triangle, but since AC is a diagonal, maybe we can find some relations.

Wait, perhaps using the angle bisector theorem. In triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD. So, by the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments created on side BD.

But wait, in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it should divide the opposite side BD into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in a trapezoid, BD is a diagonal, so maybe I can apply the angle bisector theorem here.

Wait, the angle bisector theorem states that if a ray bisects an angle of a triangle, then it divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD in triangle ABD. So, AC divides BD into segments proportional to AB and AD.

So, AB/AD = BC/CD.

Wait, but in a trapezoid, AB and CD are the legs, and AD and BC are the bases.

Wait, maybe I need to clarify the sides.

Wait, in trapezoid ABCD, with AD || BC, so sides AB and CD are the legs, and AD and BC are the bases.

So, in triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so by the angle bisector theorem, AB/AD = BC/CD.

But AB is a leg, AD is a base, BC is a base, and CD is a leg.

So, AB/AD = BC/CD.

Let me denote AB = x, AD = y, BC = z, CD = w.

So, from the angle bisector theorem, x/y = z/w.

So, xw = yz.

Also, since AD || BC, the trapezoid has area equal to (1/2)*(AD + BC)*height = 42.

The height is the distance between the two bases AD and BC. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, and CD is a leg, maybe the height is related to AC.

Wait, in triangle ACD, which is a right triangle, AC is perpendicular to CD, so AC is the height from A to CD. But in the trapezoid, the height is the distance between the two bases AD and BC.

Wait, maybe I can find the height in terms of AC.

Alternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, and CD is a leg, then AC is the height of the trapezoid.

Wait, no, because the height is the perpendicular distance between the two bases AD and BC. If AC is perpendicular to CD, which is a leg, then AC is not necessarily the height of the trapezoid.

Wait, perhaps I need to find the height in terms of AC.

Let me think. Let me denote h as the height of the trapezoid. Then, the area is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*h = 42.

Also, in triangle ACD, which is right-angled at C, AC is one leg, CD is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse.

So, AC^2 + CD^2 = AD^2.

Similarly, in triangle ABC, which is not necessarily right-angled, but AC is a diagonal.

Wait, maybe I can express h in terms of AC and the angles.

Since AC bisects angle BAD, which is 2θ, and AC is perpendicular to CD, which is a leg.

In triangle ACD, angle at A is θ, angle at C is 90 degrees, so angle at D is 90 - θ.

Similarly, in triangle ABC, angle at A is θ, angle at B is something, and angle at C is something else.

Wait, maybe I can use trigonometric ratios.

In triangle ACD, tan(theta) = CD/AC.

So, CD = AC * tan(theta).

Similarly, in triangle ABC, which is part of the trapezoid, maybe we can find some relations.

Wait, but I'm getting a bit stuck here. Maybe I should try to express all sides in terms of AC and theta.

Let me denote AC = k. Then, in triangle ACD, CD = k * tan(theta), and AD = AC / cos(theta) = k / cos(theta).

Similarly, in triangle ABC, since AC is the angle bisector, and angle BAC = theta, angle ABC can be found using the properties of the trapezoid.

Wait, in trapezoid ABCD, angles at A and D are supplementary with angles at B and C. Since AD || BC, angle BAD + angle ADC = 180 degrees. But angle ADC is 90 - theta, so angle BAD = 2 theta, so 2 theta + (90 - theta) = 180.

Wait, that would mean theta + 90 = 180, so theta = 90 degrees. But that can't be because then angle BAD would be 180 degrees, which is impossible.

Wait, that suggests a mistake in my reasoning. Let me check.

In trapezoid ABCD, with AD || BC, consecutive angles between the bases are supplementary. So, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180 degrees, and angle ADC + angle BCD = 180 degrees.

Wait, no, actually, in a trapezoid, each pair of adjacent angles on the same base are supplementary. So, angle BAD + angle ABC = 180, and angle ADC + angle BCD = 180.

But in this case, AC is perpendicular to CD, so angle ACD = 90 degrees. So, in triangle ACD, angle at C is 90, angle at A is theta, so angle at D is 90 - theta.

Therefore, angle ADC = 90 - theta.

Since angle ADC + angle BCD = 180, angle BCD = 180 - (90 - theta) = 90 + theta.

Similarly, angle BAD = 2 theta, so angle ABC = 180 - 2 theta.

Now, in triangle ABC, we have angle at A is theta, angle at B is 180 - 2 theta, so angle at C is 180 - theta - (180 - 2 theta) = theta.

Wait, so triangle ABC has angles theta at A, 180 - 2 theta at B, and theta at C. So, it's an isosceles triangle with AB = BC.

Wait, that's interesting. So, AB = BC.

But in the trapezoid, AB is a leg, and BC is a base. So, AB = BC.

Wait, but in a trapezoid, the legs are usually not equal to the bases unless it's a special case.

Wait, but if AB = BC, and AD || BC, then maybe the trapezoid is actually a parallelogram? But no, because in a parallelogram, both pairs of opposite sides are parallel, but here only AD || BC is given.

Wait, but if AB = BC, and AD || BC, then maybe it's a special trapezoid.

Wait, let me think again. In triangle ABC, angles at A and C are both theta, so sides opposite these angles are equal. So, side opposite angle A is BC, and side opposite angle C is AB. So, BC = AB.

So, AB = BC.

So, in the trapezoid, AB = BC, and AD || BC.

So, AB is a leg equal in length to base BC.

Hmm, that's an interesting property.

So, AB = BC = x, let's say.

And AD is the other base, which we can denote as y.

And CD is the other leg, which we can denote as w.

From the angle bisector theorem earlier, we had AB/AD = BC/CD.

But AB = BC = x, so x/y = x/w, which implies y = w.

So, AD = CD.

Wait, that's interesting. So, AD = CD.

But AD is a base, and CD is a leg. So, in the trapezoid, one of the legs is equal in length to one of the bases.

So, AD = CD = y.

So, now, in triangle ACD, which is right-angled at C, we have AC perpendicular to CD, so AC is one leg, CD is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse.

So, AC^2 + CD^2 = AD^2.

But CD = AD = y, so AC^2 + y^2 = y^2, which implies AC^2 = 0, which is impossible.

Wait, that can't be. So, I must have made a mistake","[0, '0']",28,"[28, '28']",False
"Alright, so I've got this equation to solve: √(2x) divided by √(3x - 1) equals 3/2. Hmm, okay. Let me write that down to visualize it better. It's √(2x)/√(3x - 1) = 3/2. I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.

First, I remember that when dealing with square roots in equations, it's often helpful to eliminate them by squaring both sides. That should simplify things a bit. So, if I square both sides of the equation, I can get rid of the square roots. Let me try that.

Squaring the left side: (√(2x)/√(3x - 1))². That should be equal to (2x)/(3x - 1). And squaring the right side: (3/2)² is 9/4. So now, the equation becomes (2x)/(3x - 1) = 9/4.

Okay, so now I have a rational equation. To solve for x, I can cross-multiply. That means multiplying both sides by (3x - 1) and by 4 to eliminate the denominators. Let's do that step by step.

Multiplying both sides by (3x - 1) gives me 2x = (9/4)(3x - 1). Hmm, but maybe it's better to cross-multiply directly. So, 2x * 4 = 9 * (3x - 1). Let me compute that.

2x * 4 is 8x, and 9*(3x - 1) is 27x - 9. So now, the equation is 8x = 27x - 9. Hmm, okay, now I can solve for x by getting all the x terms on one side.

Subtracting 27x from both sides: 8x - 27x = -9. That simplifies to -19x = -9. Now, dividing both sides by -19 gives x = (-9)/(-19), which simplifies to x = 9/19.

Wait, but I should check if this solution is valid in the original equation because sometimes squaring both sides can introduce extraneous solutions. So, let me plug x = 9/19 back into the original equation and see if it holds true.

First, compute √(2x). 2x is 2*(9/19) = 18/19. So, √(18/19). Then, compute √(3x - 1). 3x is 27/19, so 3x - 1 is 27/19 - 19/19 = 8/19. So, √(8/19).

Now, the left side of the equation is √(18/19)/√(8/19). Let's simplify that. The denominators are the same, so it's √18/√8. Which is √(18/8). Simplifying 18/8, that's 9/4. So, √(9/4) is 3/2. Which is exactly the right side of the equation. So, yes, x = 9/19 is a valid solution.

I think that's it. I don't see any mistakes in my steps. I squared both sides correctly, cross-multiplied, solved for x, and then checked the solution in the original equation. Everything seems to work out. So, x is 9/19.

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{\dfrac{9}{19}}.
</think>

Given the equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x - 1}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

First, we square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\[
\left( \frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x - 1}} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{3}{2} \right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x - 1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we cross-multiply to solve for \(x\):

\[
2x \cdot 4 = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

Simplifying both sides:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

Dividing both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

We verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation and confirming it holds true. Thus, the solution is:

\[
\boxed{\dfrac{9}{19}}

"Alright, so I've got this problem here about four points on a circle, labeled A, B, C, and D, chosen randomly and independently. The question is asking about the probability that the arcs AB and CD overlap. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, I need to understand what it means for two arcs to overlap. If I have two arcs on a circle, they can either be completely separate, just touching at a point, or overlapping. Since the points are chosen randomly, the arcs AB and CD could be in any position. So, I need to figure out the chance that these two arcs actually intersect each other.

Let me think about how to model this. Since the points are chosen randomly on the circumference of a circle, I can fix one point and consider the positions of the others relative to it. This is a common technique in probability problems involving circles because it simplifies the calculations by removing one variable.

Let's fix point A at some position on the circle. Now, the positions of points B, C, and D are random. But since the circle is continuous, the exact position doesn't matter; what matters is the relative positions. So, I can consider the circle as a unit circle for simplicity, with circumference 1, and fix point A at position 0. Then, the positions of B, C, and D can be represented as three independent random variables uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

Wait, but actually, since we're dealing with arcs, the order of the points matters. So, maybe it's better to think in terms of the order of the points around the circle. If I fix A at 0, then the positions of B, C, and D can be anywhere else on the circle. But since the circle is continuous, the probability calculations can be done by considering the relative positions.

Alternatively, another approach is to fix point A and then consider the positions of B, C, and D relative to A. Since the circle is symmetric, fixing A doesn't affect the generality of the problem.

So, let's fix A at 0. Then, the positions of B, C, and D are three independent uniform random variables on [0,1). Let's denote their positions as b, c, and d, respectively.

Now, the arc AB is the arc from A to B, which can be either clockwise or counterclockwise. But since we're dealing with arcs on a circle, the length of the arc AB is the minimum of |b - 0| and 1 - |b - 0|, but actually, since we're considering arcs between two points, it's just the shorter arc. But wait, in this problem, are we considering the arcs as the minor arcs or the major arcs? The problem doesn't specify, but I think it's safe to assume that it's the minor arc, i.e., the shorter one.

But actually, when we talk about arcs between two points on a circle, unless specified otherwise, it's usually the minor arc. So, arc AB is the shorter arc between A and B, and similarly for arc CD.

But wait, the problem says ""சுற்றளவில் நான்கு புள்ளிகள், A, B, C, மற்றும் D, சீரற்ற முறையில் மற்றும் தனித்தனியாக தேர்ந்தெடுக்கப்படுகின்றன."" So, four points chosen randomly and independently on the circumference. So, the arcs AB and CD are the arcs between these points.

Now, the question is whether arcs AB and CD overlap. So, when do two arcs on a circle overlap? They overlap if they share some common points, meaning that the intervals on the circle defined by AB and CD intersect.

But since the circle is a closed loop, the arcs can be thought of as intervals on a line from 0 to 1, but with the endpoints identified. So, to model this, we can fix A at 0, and then represent the positions of B, C, D as points on [0,1). Then, the arc AB is the interval from 0 to b (assuming b is the position of B), but since it's a circle, it could also be from b to 0 going the other way. But since we're considering the minor arc, it's the shorter interval.

Wait, but actually, for the purpose of checking overlap, maybe it's better to consider the arcs as intervals on the circle without worrying about which is shorter. Because even if one arc is longer, if they cross each other, they still overlap.

Wait, no. If two arcs are on a circle, they can either be completely separate, just touching, or overlapping. So, for two arcs to overlap, their corresponding intervals on the circle must intersect.

But how do we model this? Let me think.

Let me fix point A at 0. Then, the positions of B, C, D are three independent uniform random variables on [0,1). Let's denote them as b, c, d.

Now, the arc AB is the interval from A to B, which is from 0 to b if we go clockwise, or from b to 0 if we go counterclockwise. But since we're considering the minor arc, it's the shorter one. So, the length of arc AB is min(b, 1 - b). Similarly for arc CD.

But for the purpose of checking overlap, maybe it's better to consider the arcs as intervals on the circle, regardless of their length. So, arc AB is the set of points between A and B in the clockwise direction, and arc CD is the set of points between C and D in the clockwise direction.

Wait, but actually, the arcs AB and CD can be in any direction. So, perhaps it's better to think of them as intervals on the circle, and check if these intervals overlap.

But since the circle is a loop, the intervals can wrap around. So, to check if two intervals overlap, we can ""unfold"" the circle into a line by cutting it at some point, say at point A, and then represent the positions of B, C, D on the line from 0 to 1, with 0 and 1 identified.

But this might complicate things. Alternatively, we can fix A at 0, and then consider the positions of B, C, D on [0,1). Then, the arc AB is the interval from 0 to b, and the arc CD is the interval from c to d, but we have to consider the circular nature.

Wait, no. Because if c > d, then the arc CD would wrap around from c to d, which is equivalent to [c,1) and [0,d). Similarly, arc AB is [0,b) if b < 0.5, otherwise it's [b,1).

Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the circle as a line from 0 to 1, with 0 and 1 identified. Then, the four points A, B, C, D are four points on this line. Fix A at 0, then B, C, D are three points in [0,1). Now, the arc AB is the interval from 0 to b, and the arc CD is the interval from c to d, but if c > d, then it's from c to 1 and from 0 to d.

But this seems messy. Maybe another approach is to consider the circle as a unit circumference, fix A at 0, and then the positions of B, C, D are three independent uniform points on [0,1). Then, the arc AB is the interval from 0 to b, and the arc CD is the interval from c to d, but considering the circular nature, if c > d, then CD is from c to 1 and from 0 to d.

But perhaps a better way is to consider the four points on the circle and their order. Since the points are randomly placed, the order of B, C, D around the circle relative to A is random. So, we can consider all possible orderings of B, C, D around the circle.

There are 3! = 6 possible orderings of B, C, D. Each ordering is equally likely because the points are chosen independently and uniformly.

Wait, but actually, since we fixed A at 0, the positions of B, C, D are just three points in [0,1). The order in which they appear around the circle is a random permutation. So, the probability that B comes before C, which comes before D, etc., is 1/6 for each permutation.

But how does this help us? Well, if we can figure out in how many of these permutations the arcs AB and CD overlap, then we can find the probability.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to think in terms of the positions of B, C, D relative to A. Let's fix A at 0, and then the positions of B, C, D are three points in [0,1). Let's denote their positions as x, y, z, where x, y, z are independent uniform [0,1) random variables.

Now, the arc AB is the interval from 0 to x (assuming x is the position of B). Similarly, the arc CD is the interval from y to z, but if y > z, then it's from y to 1 and from 0 to z.

But this is getting complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the circle as a line from 0 to 1, and fix A at 0. Then, the positions of B, C, D are three points in [0,1). The arc AB is the interval from 0 to b, and the arc CD is the interval from c to d, but if c > d, then CD wraps around.

But perhaps instead of worrying about the wrapping, we can consider the arcs as intervals on the circle and check if they intersect.

Wait, another idea: for two arcs to overlap, their corresponding intervals on the circle must intersect. So, if we fix A at 0, and consider the positions of B, C, D, then the arc AB is from 0 to b, and the arc CD is from c to d. But since the circle is a loop, if c > d, then CD is from c to 1 and from 0 to d.

But maybe it's easier to ""unfold"" the circle into a line by cutting it at some point, say at A, and then represent the positions of B, C, D on the line from 0 to 1. Then, the arc AB is just the interval [0, b], and the arc CD is the interval [c, d] if c < d, or [c,1) ∪ [0,d) if c > d.

But in this case, the arcs AB and CD overlap if either:

1. The interval [0, b] overlaps with [c, d], or
2. The interval [0, b] overlaps with [c,1) ∪ [0,d).

Wait, this is getting too convoluted. Maybe a better approach is to consider the four points on the circle and their order. Since the points are randomly placed, the order of B, C, D around the circle relative to A is random. So, we can consider all possible orderings of B, C, D around the circle.

There are 3! = 6 possible orderings. Each ordering is equally likely because the points are chosen independently and uniformly.

Now, for each ordering, we can determine whether arcs AB and CD overlap.

Let me list all possible orderings:

1. B, C, D
2. B, D, C
3. C, B, D
4. C, D, B
5. D, B, C
6. D, C, B

For each of these, I need to see if arcs AB and CD overlap.

Wait, but actually, since we fixed A at 0, the order of B, C, D around the circle is determined by their positions on [0,1). So, for example, if B is at position x, C at y, D at z, with x < y < z, then the order is B, C, D.

But in reality, the positions can be in any order. So, the six orderings correspond to the six permutations of B, C, D.

Now, for each permutation, I need to determine if arcs AB and CD overlap.

But how?

Let me think about what it means for arcs AB and CD to overlap. Arc AB is from A to B, and arc CD is from C to D. If these two arcs share any common point, they overlap.

But since A is fixed at 0, arc AB is from 0 to B. Arc CD is from C to D. So, if the interval [0, B] overlaps with the interval [C, D], considering the circular nature, then the arcs overlap.

But since we've fixed A at 0, and the circle is now a line from 0 to 1, with 0 and 1 identified, the interval [C, D] could wrap around if C > D.

Wait, perhaps it's better to consider the circle as a line from 0 to 1, and then the arcs AB and CD can be represented as intervals on this line, possibly wrapping around.

But this is getting too complicated. Maybe a better approach is to consider the circle as a unit circumference, fix A at 0, and then the positions of B, C, D are three points in [0,1). The arc AB is the interval from 0 to B, and the arc CD is the interval from C to D, but if C > D, then CD is from C to 1 and from 0 to D.

But perhaps instead of worrying about the wrapping, we can consider the arcs as intervals on the circle and check if they intersect.

Wait, another idea: for two arcs to overlap, their corresponding intervals on the circle must intersect. So, if we fix A at 0, and consider the positions of B, C, D, then the arc AB is the interval from 0 to B, and the arc CD is the interval from C to D. If these two intervals overlap, then the arcs overlap.

But since the circle is a loop, if C > D, then CD is from C to 1 and from 0 to D. So, in that case, the interval CD is [C,1) ∪ [0,D). So, the arc CD is actually two intervals.

Therefore, the arc AB (which is [0,B)) will overlap with CD if either:

1. [0,B) overlaps with [C,1), or
2. [0,B) overlaps with [0,D).

But [0,B) overlapping with [0,D) is only possible if D > 0, which it always is, but more specifically, if D > 0 and B > 0, which they are. Wait, no, that's not the right way to think about it.

Wait, actually, if CD is [C,1) ∪ [0,D), then for AB ([0,B)) to overlap with CD, either:

- [0,B) overlaps with [C","[0, '0']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",False
"Alright, so I have this geometry problem here with two circles sharing the same center D. The radii are 1 and 2, so one is twice as big as the other. The shaded area is supposed to be 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of angle ADC, which is the angle at the center between points A and C.

First, let me visualize this. There's a smaller circle with radius 1 and a larger circle with radius 2. Points A and C are on the larger circle, and D is the center. The shaded area is some region between the two circles, probably a segment or something similar.

The Asymptote code shows that there are two shaded regions. One is a gray region that seems to be a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, and another gray region which is a lens-shaped area formed by the two circles. Hmm, maybe I need to calculate the area of these regions and set up an equation.

Let me think about the areas. The area of the larger circle is π*(2)^2 = 4π. The smaller circle has an area of π*(1)^2 = π. The shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, so that's (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π.

So, the total shaded area is (5/3)π. Now, I need to figure out how this shaded area is composed. Looking at the Asymptote code, it seems like there are two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, and the other is a lens-shaped area formed by the overlapping segments.

Wait, maybe it's simpler. Perhaps the shaded area is the area between the two circles, which is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle, but only for a certain angle. That is, the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle, and that equals (5/3)π.

Let me denote the angle ADC as θ (theta). Then, the area of the sector in the larger circle is (θ/360)*π*(2)^2 = (θ/360)*4π. Similarly, the area of the sector in the smaller circle is (θ/360)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/360)*π.

So, the area between the two sectors (the shaded region) would be the difference between these two sectors: (θ/360)*4π - (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*3π.

According to the problem, this area is (5/3)π. So, I can set up the equation:

(θ/360)*3π = (5/3)π

Simplify both sides by dividing by π:

(θ/360)*3 = 5/3

Multiply both sides by 360:

θ*3 = (5/3)*360

Simplify the right side:

(5/3)*360 = 5*120 = 600

So, θ*3 = 600

Divide both sides by 3:

θ = 200 degrees

Wait, that seems too big. An angle of 200 degrees is more than half the circle. Let me check my reasoning.

Is the shaded area just the area between the two sectors? Or is it something else? Looking back at the Asymptote code, it seems like there are two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, and another is a lens-shaped area. Maybe I need to consider both shaded regions.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the union of two regions: one is a segment of the larger circle, and the other is a segment of the smaller circle. But that might complicate things.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector, which is what I initially thought. But if θ is 200 degrees, that would mean the shaded area is 200/360 of the annulus area.

Wait, the annulus area is π*(2^2 - 1^2) = 3π. So, 200/360 of that is (200/360)*3π = (5/9)*3π = (5/3)π, which matches the given shaded area. So, that seems correct.

But 200 degrees is a reflex angle, which is more than 180 degrees. Is that possible? In the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees, but that might just be a default. The problem doesn't specify whether the angle is acute or obtuse, just asks for the measure.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees, but in the problem, it's asking for the angle ADC, which is the angle between points A, D, and C. If the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle, which is 4π, so 5/12*4π = 5/3π.

Wait, but if the shaded area is 5/3π, and the annulus area is 3π, then 5/3π is 5/9 of the annulus. So, 5/9 of 360 degrees is 200 degrees. So, that seems correct.

But let me think again. If the angle is 200 degrees, then the sector area in the larger circle is (200/360)*4π = (5/9)*4π = 20π/9. The sector area in the smaller circle is (200/360)*π = (5/9)*π. So, the area between them is 20π/9 - 5π/9 = 15π/9 = 5π/3, which is indeed 5/3π. So, that matches.

Therefore, the angle ADC is 200 degrees. But wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees. Is there a mistake here?

Wait, maybe I misinterpreted the shaded area. The Asymptote code shows two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, and another is a lens-shaped area. Maybe the total shaded area is the sum of these two regions.

Let me recast the problem. The shaded area is the union of two regions: one is the segment of the larger circle minus the segment of the smaller circle, and the other is the lens-shaped area formed by the overlapping segments.

Wait, that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector, which is what I initially thought, giving 200 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees, which is different. Maybe the angle is actually 100 degrees, but the problem states that the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle. So, perhaps I need to recast my approach.

Wait, let's recast the problem. The shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is 4π. So, 5/12*4π = 5π/3. So, the shaded area is 5π/3.

If the shaded area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector, then:

Area = (θ/360)*4π - (θ/360)*π = (θ/360)*3π = 5π/3

So, (θ/360)*3π = 5π/3

Divide both sides by π:

(θ/360)*3 = 5/3

Multiply both sides by 360:

θ*3 = (5/3)*360

θ*3 = 600

θ = 200 degrees

So, that's consistent. So, the angle is 200 degrees.

But in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees. Maybe the Asymptote code is just an example, and the actual angle is 200 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the sum of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. Let me think.

Wait, the Asymptote code shows two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, and another is a lens-shaped area. Maybe the total shaded area is the sum of these two.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector, which is 5π/3, leading to θ = 200 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe the shaded area is the area of the larger circle's segment plus the area of the smaller circle's segment. Let me calculate that.

The area of a segment is (θ/360)*πr² - (1/2)r² sinθ.

So, for the larger circle, the segment area is (θ/360)*4π - (1/2)*4 sinθ = (θ/90)π - 2 sinθ.

For the smaller circle, the segment area is (θ/360)*π - (1/2)*1² sinθ = (θ/360)π - (1/2) sinθ.

If the shaded area is the sum of these two segments, then:

[(θ/90)π - 2 sinθ] + [(θ/360)π - (1/2) sinθ] = 5π/3

Combine like terms:

(θ/90 + θ/360)π - (2 + 1/2) sinθ = 5π/3

Convert θ/90 to 4θ/360, so total θ terms: 4θ/360 + θ/360 = 5θ/360 = θ/72.

So, (θ/72)π - (5/2) sinθ = 5π/3

This seems more complicated, and I don't know if this is the right approach. Maybe the initial approach was correct, considering the shaded area as the area between the two sectors, which is 5π/3, leading to θ = 200 degrees.

Alternatively, perhaps the shaded area is the area of the larger sector minus the area of the smaller sector, which is 5π/3, so θ = 200 degrees.

But let me check: if θ is 200 degrees, then the area between the sectors is 5π/3, which is correct. So, that seems to be the answer.

Wait, but 200 degrees is a reflex angle, which is more than 180 degrees. Is that acceptable? The problem doesn't specify, so I think it's acceptable.

Therefore, the measure of angle ADC is 200 degrees.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees. Maybe I need to consider that the shaded area is the smaller segment, not the larger one. Let me think again.

If the angle is 100 degrees, then the area between the sectors would be (100/360)*3π = (5/18)*3π = 5π/6, which is less than 5π/3. So, that's not matching.

Alternatively, if the shaded area is the smaller segment, then the area would be (100/360)*4π - (100/360)*π = (100/360)*3π = 5π/6, which is not 5π/3.

So, that doesn't match. Therefore, the angle must be 200 degrees, which gives the area between the sectors as 5π/3, which is 5/12 of the larger circle's area.

Wait, 5π/3 is indeed 5/12 of 4π, because 4π*(5/12) = (20/12)π = 5π/3. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the measure of angle ADC is 200 degrees.

But wait, in the Asymptote code, the angle is set to 100 degrees, but the problem states that the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle. So, perhaps the Asymptote code is just an example, and the actual angle is 200 degrees.

Alternatively, maybe I'm misinterpreting the shaded area. Let me look again.

The Asymptote code shows two shaded regions: one is a segment of the larger circle minus a segment of the smaller circle, and another is a lens-shaped area. Maybe the total shaded area is the sum of these two.

Wait, if the angle is 100 degrees, then the area of the larger sector is (100/360)*4π = (5/18)*4π = 10π/9. The area of the smaller sector is (100/360)*π = 5π/18. So, the area between them is 10π/9 - 5π/18 = 20π/18 - 5π/18 = 15π/18 = 5π/6.

Then, the lens-shaped area is the area of the smaller circle's segment plus the area of the larger circle's segment. Wait, no, the lens-shaped area is the intersection of the two circles, which is the sum of the two segments.

Wait, the lens area is calculated as 2*( (θ/360)*πr² - (1/2)r² sinθ ). But since the circles are concentric, the lens area would actually be zero because they don't overlap except at the center. Wait, no, concentric circles don't overlap except at the center, so the lens area is zero. Hmm, that can't be.

Wait, no, the Asymptote code shows two circles with the same center, so they are concentric. Therefore, the lens-shaped area is actually the area of the smaller circle, but that doesn't make sense. Wait, no, the lens-shaped area is formed by the intersection of two circles, but since they are concentric, their intersection is just the smaller circle. So, maybe the shaded area is the annulus sector, which is the area between the two sectors.

Therefore, the shaded area is the area between the two sectors, which is 5π/3, leading to θ = 200 degrees.

புதிய கணக்கை செய்யும் முன், எந்த வகையான பரப்பளவைகளைக் கணக்கிட வேண்டும் என்பதை ஆராய்வோம். குவளை உருளை வடிவது, அதாவது ஆடை வடிவது. ஆடையின் பரப்பளவையைக் கணக்கிடுவதற்கு வாய்ப்பு முறைப்படி:

ஆடையின் பரப்பளவை = πr²h

இங்கு, r = 3 செ.மீ, h = 8 செ.மீ.

ஆடையின் பரப்பளவை = π * 3² * 8 = π * 9 * 8 = 72π கு.செ.மீ³

அடுத்து, கோள வடிவத் தொட்டியின் பரப்பளவையைக் கணக்கிடுவதற்கு கோளத்தின் பரப்பளவையைப் பயன்படுத்துகிறோம். கோளத்தின் பரப்பளவை = (4/3)πR³

இங்கு, R = 6 செ.மீ.

கோளத்தின் பரப்பளவை = (4/3)π * 6³ = (4/3)π * 216 = 288π கு.செ.மீ³

எதிர்பார்க்கப்படும் குவளைகளின் எண்ணிக்கை = (ஆடையின் பரப்பளவை) / (கோளத்தின் பரப்பளவை) = 72π / 288π = 72/288 = 1/4

ஆனால், 1/4 என்று எதிர்பார்க்கப்படும் குவளைகளின் எண்ணிக்கை என்றால், இது தவறாக இருக்கும், ஏனென்றால் கோளத்தின் ஆரம் 6 செ.மீ ஆகிறது, ஆடையின் ஆரம் 3 செ.மீ மட்டுமே. ஆடையின் ஆரம் கோளத்தின் ஆரத்தில் ஒரு பாத்திரம் மட்டுமே, அதாவது, கோளத்தை ஆடையில் நிரப்ப முடியாது. ஆகவே, இந்த கணக்கை தவறாக செய்யப்பட்டது.

"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. I remember that there are product-to-sum formulas, but I'm not sure if they apply directly here. Alternatively, maybe I can use the sine addition and subtraction formulas. Let me think.

Let me denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). So, the expression becomes \(\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\beta - \alpha)\). That seems a bit simpler. Now, I can use the sine addition and subtraction formulas on each term.

The sine addition formula is \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), and the sine subtraction formula is \(\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\). So, applying these to \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin(\beta - \alpha)\):

\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin(\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Now, if I multiply these two expressions together, I get:

\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha)
\]

Let me expand this product:

First, multiply \(\sin \alpha \cos \beta\) with each term in the second parenthesis:
- \(\sin \alpha \cos \beta \cdot \sin \beta \cos \alpha = \sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \alpha \cos \beta\)
- \(\sin \alpha \cos \beta \cdot (-\cos \beta \sin \alpha) = -\sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta\)

Next, multiply \(\cos \alpha \sin \beta\) with each term in the second parenthesis:
- \(\cos \alpha \sin \beta \cdot \sin \beta \cos \alpha = \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta\)
- \(\cos \alpha \sin \beta \cdot (-\cos \beta \sin \alpha) = -\cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha\)

So, putting it all together:

\[
\sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \alpha \cos \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

Hmm, this looks a bit messy. Let me see if I can simplify this expression. I notice that the first and last terms are similar but with opposite signs. Let's write them out:

First term: \(\sin \alpha \sin \beta \cos \alpha \cos \beta\)
Last term: \(-\cos \alpha \sin \beta \cos \beta \sin \alpha\)

These are actually the same, just written in a different order, so they cancel each other out. So, those two terms add up to zero.

Now, we're left with:

\[
- \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta + \cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta
\]

Which can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos^2 \alpha \sin^2 \beta - \sin^2 \alpha \cos^2 \beta
\]

Hmm, this looks like a difference of squares. Let me factor it:

\[
(\cos \alpha \sin \beta - \sin \alpha \cos \beta)(\cos \alpha \sin \beta + \sin \alpha \cos \beta)
\]

Wait a second, that's interesting. The first factor is \(\sin(\beta - \alpha)\) because \(\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\), but here it's \(\cos \alpha \sin \beta - \sin \alpha \cos \beta\), which is actually \(\sin(\beta - \alpha)\). Similarly, the second factor is \(\sin(\beta + \alpha)\) because \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), which is exactly the second factor.

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\sin(\beta - \alpha) \cdot \sin(\beta + \alpha)
\]

But wait, that's exactly the original expression we started with! So, this approach seems to be going in circles. Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me think again. Maybe instead of expanding the product, I can use another identity. I remember that \(\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(A - B) - \cos(A + B)]\). Let me try applying this identity to the original expression.

So, if I let \(A = \alpha + \beta\) and \(B = \beta - \alpha\), then:

\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha)) - \cos((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha))]
\]

Simplifying the arguments inside the cosines:

First term inside the brackets: \((\alpha + \beta) - (\beta - \alpha) = \alpha + \beta - \beta + \alpha = 2\alpha\)
Second term inside the brackets: \((\alpha + \beta) + (\beta - \alpha) = \alpha + \beta + \beta - \alpha = 2\beta\)

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos(2\alpha) - \cos(2\beta)]
\]

That's a much simpler expression! Now, I just need to compute \(\cos(2\alpha)\) and \(\cos(2\beta)\).

Given that \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), so \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\). Similarly, \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), so \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

I can use the double-angle formula for cosine: \(\cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\).

So, let's compute \(\cos(2\alpha)\):

\[
\cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

Similarly, compute \(\cos(2\beta)\):

\[
\cos(2\beta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \beta = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

Now, substitute these back into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} (0.18) = 0.09
\]

So, the value of the original expression is 0.09.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Starting from the beginning, I set \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then, I used the identity for the product of sines, which transformed the expression into \(\frac{1}{2} [\cos(2\alpha) - \cos(2\beta)]\). Calculated \(\cos(2\alpha)\) as 0.68 and \(\cos(2\beta)\) as 0.5, leading to 0.09. That seems correct.

Alternatively, I can compute the original expression numerically to verify. Let's compute each part step by step.

First, compute \(\arcsin 0.4\). Using a calculator, \(\arcsin 0.4\) is approximately 0.4115 radians. Similarly, \(\arcsin 0.5\) is \(\pi/6\) or approximately 0.5236 radians.

So, \(\alpha + \beta \approx 0.4115 + 0.5236 = 0.9351\) radians, and \(\beta - \alpha \approx 0.5236 - 0.4115 = 0.1121\) radians.

Now, compute \(\sin(0.9351)\) and \(\sin(0.1121)\):

- \(\sin(0.9351)\) is approximately \(\sin(0.9351) \approx 0.8077\)
- \(\sin(0.1121)\) is approximately \(\sin(0.1121) \approx 0.1120\)

Multiplying these together: \(0.8077 \times 0.1120 \approx 0.0904\), which is approximately 0.09. So, that matches my earlier result.

Therefore, I'm confident that the value is 0.09.

**Final Answer**
The value is \boxed{0.09}.
</think>

Let \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). We need to find the value of \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the identity for the product of sines, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos(2\alpha) - \cos(2\beta)]
\]

First, we compute \(\cos(2\alpha)\) and \(\cos(2\beta)\) using the double-angle formula for cosine, \(\cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2 \theta\):

- For \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\):
  \[
  \cos(2\alpha) = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
  \]

- For \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\):
  \[
  \cos(2\beta) = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
  \]

Substituting these values back into the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} (0.18) = 0.09
\]

Thus, the value is \(\boxed{0.09}\).","[0.0900000000000000, '0.09']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",True

"Alright, so I have this equation to solve: the cube root of (x squared minus 4x plus 4) equals 16. Hmm, okay, let me write that down to make it clearer. It's ∛(x² - 4x + 4) = 16. I need to find the value of x that satisfies this equation.

First, I remember that to get rid of a cube root, I can cube both sides of the equation. That should help me simplify things. So, if I cube both sides, the left side becomes just x² - 4x + 4, and the right side becomes 16 cubed. Let me calculate 16 cubed. 16 times 16 is 256, and 256 times 16 is... let me do that step by step. 256 times 10 is 2560, and 256 times 6 is 1536. Adding those together, 2560 + 1536 is 4096. So, 16 cubed is 4096.

Now, my equation simplifies to x² - 4x + 4 = 4096. Okay, so I have a quadratic equation here. Let me rearrange it to standard form. I'll subtract 4096 from both sides to get x² - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0. Simplifying that, 4 - 4096 is -4092, so the equation becomes x² - 4x - 4092 = 0.

Alright, now I need to solve this quadratic equation. I can use the quadratic formula, which is x = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). In this equation, a is 1, b is -4, and c is -4092. Let me plug those values into the formula.

First, let's compute the discriminant, which is b² - 4ac. So, b squared is (-4)², which is 16. Then, 4ac is 4 times 1 times (-4092), which is 4 * (-4092) = -16368. So, the discriminant is 16 - (-16368). Subtracting a negative is like adding, so 16 + 16368 is 16384.

Hmm, 16384 is a perfect square, right? Let me check. I know that 128 squared is 16384 because 128 times 128 is 16384. So, the square root of 16384 is 128.

Now, plugging back into the quadratic formula: x = [-(-4) ± 128] / (2*1). Simplifying the numerator, -(-4) is 4, so we have x = [4 ± 128] / 2.

This gives us two possible solutions. The first one is (4 + 128)/2, which is 132/2 = 66. The second one is (4 - 128)/2, which is (-124)/2 = -62.

So, the solutions are x = 66 and x = -62. But wait, I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when we cube both sides, we might introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me test x = 66 first. Plugging it into the original equation: ∛(66² - 4*66 + 4). Calculating inside the cube root: 66 squared is 4356, 4 times 66 is 264, so 4356 - 264 is 4092, plus 4 is 4096. The cube root of 4096 is indeed 16, so that works.

Now, let's test x = -62. Plugging into the original equation: ∛((-62)² - 4*(-62) + 4). Calculating inside: (-62) squared is 3844, 4 times -62 is -248, so 3844 - (-248) is 3844 + 248 = 4092, plus 4 is 4096. The cube root of 4096 is 16, so that also works.

Wait, so both solutions are valid? That's interesting. I thought sometimes when dealing with roots, especially even roots, you might get extraneous solutions, but since this is a cube root, which is an odd root, both positive and negative solutions are acceptable. So, both x = 66 and x = -62 are valid solutions.

But the question specifically asks for the positive value of x. So, among the two solutions, 66 is positive and -62 is negative. Therefore, the positive solution is x = 66.

Let me just recap the steps to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I started by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root, which gave me a quadratic equation. I solved the quadratic using the quadratic formula, found two solutions, checked both in the original equation, and confirmed they both work. Since the question asks for the positive value, I selected 66.

I think that's solid. I don't see any errors in my calculations. The key steps were cubing both sides correctly, solving the quadratic, and verifying the solutions. It's always good to check because sometimes even with odd roots, depending on the equation, you might get extraneous solutions, but in this case, both worked.

So, yeah, I'm confident that x = 66 is the positive solution to the equation.

**Final Answer**
The positive value of \( x \) is \boxed{66}.
</think>

To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by cubing both sides to eliminate the cube root:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to standard quadratic form:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0 \implies x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). First, we calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4(1)(-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384
\]

The square root of the discriminant is:

\[
\sqrt{16384} = 128
\]

Substituting back into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm 128}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
\]

We verify both solutions in the original equation and find that both are valid. Since the question asks for the positive value, we select \(x = 66\).

\boxed{66}

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that there are some trigonometric identities that can help simplify products of cosines. One of them is the product-to-sum formulas, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, I recall that sometimes products of cosines can be related to roots of unity or complex numbers. Maybe that's a way to go.

Let me write down the angles involved: 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15. I notice that each angle is double the previous one. Starting from 2π/15, doubling gives 4π/15, then 8π/15, and then 16π/15. Wait, 16π/15 is more than π, so maybe I can find an equivalent angle by subtracting 2π? Let's see: 16π/15 - 2π = 16π/15 - 30π/15 = -14π/15. But cosine is an even function, so cos(-14π/15) = cos(14π/15). So, cos(16π/15) is equal to cos(14π/15). That might be useful.

So, the product becomes cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(14π/15). Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I have four cosine terms with angles that are multiples of 2π/15, specifically 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 14π/15. I wonder if these angles have any special properties or if they relate to each other in a way that can be exploited.

I remember that in some cases, products of cosines can be expressed in terms of sine functions using the identity that relates the product of cosines to a ratio of sines. Specifically, there's a formula for the product of multiple cosines when the angles are in a geometric progression. Let me try to recall that.

I think the formula is something like:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k x) = sin(2^n x) / (2^n sin x)

But wait, is that correct? Let me test it with a small n. Let's take n=2. Then, the product would be cos(x) * cos(2x). According to the formula, it should be sin(4x)/(4 sin x). Let's compute both sides.

Left side: cos(x) * cos(2x) = [cos(3x) + cos(x)] / 2, using the product-to-sum formula. Hmm, that's not the same as sin(4x)/(4 sin x). Maybe I misremembered the formula.

Wait, perhaps it's for a different kind of product. Alternatively, maybe it's for the product of sines. Let me check.

I think the correct identity is:

Product_{k=1}^{n} cos(2^{k-1} x) = sin(2^n x) / (2^n sin x)

Yes, that seems more accurate. Let me test it with n=2. Then, the product is cos(x) * cos(2x). According to the formula, it should be sin(4x)/(4 sin x). Let's compute both sides.

Left side: cos(x) * cos(2x) = [cos(3x) + cos(x)] / 2.

Right side: sin(4x)/(4 sin x) = [2 sin(2x) cos(2x)] / (4 sin x) = [2*(2 sin x cos x) * cos(2x)] / (4 sin x) = [4 sin x cos x cos(2x)] / (4 sin x) = cos x cos(2x). Wait, that's the same as the left side. So, actually, the formula holds for n=2.

Wait, but when I expanded the left side, I got [cos(3x) + cos(x)] / 2, which is equal to cos x cos 2x. So, the formula seems to hold. Therefore, the identity is correct.

So, in our case, we have four cosine terms: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), and cos(14π/15). Wait, but 14π/15 is not 16π/15, but we saw earlier that cos(16π/15) = cos(14π/15). So, the product is cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(14π/15).

Now, let's see if these angles can be expressed as 2^{k} x for some x. Let's set x = 2π/15. Then, 2x = 4π/15, 4x = 8π/15, 8x = 16π/15, which is equivalent to 14π/15 as we saw earlier. So, the angles are x, 2x, 4x, 8x, where x = 2π/15.

So, the product is cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * cos(8x). According to the identity I just recalled, the product of cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}x) is equal to sin(2^n x) / (2^n sin x). In this case, n=4, so the product should be sin(16x)/(16 sin x).

Let me write that down:

Product = cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * cos(8x) = sin(16x)/(16 sin x)

Substituting x = 2π/15, we get:

Product = sin(16*(2π/15)) / (16 sin(2π/15)) = sin(32π/15) / (16 sin(2π/15))

Now, let's simplify sin(32π/15). Since sine has a period of 2π, we can subtract 2π to find an equivalent angle:

32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15

So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Therefore, the product becomes:

sin(2π/15) / (16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16

Wait, that's interesting. So, the product simplifies to 1/16. But let me double-check that because sometimes when dealing with multiple angles, especially when they exceed π, there might be a sign change or something else.

Wait, sin(32π/15) is equal to sin(2π/15 + 2π) because 32π/15 = 2π + 2π/15. Since sine is periodic with period 2π, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, that part is correct.

Therefore, the product is indeed 1/16. But wait, let me make sure that the identity I used applies here. The identity is for the product of cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * ... * cos(2^{n-1}x) = sin(2^n x)/(2^n sin x). In our case, n=4, so 2^4 x = 16x, which is 32π/15, and that's correct.

But let me also consider the angles. The original product was cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). We converted 16π/15 to 14π/15, but in the identity, we have cos(8x) where x=2π/15, so 8x=16π/15, which is the same as 14π/15 because 16π/15 - 2π = -14π/15, and cosine is even, so cos(16π/15)=cos(14π/15). So, the identity still holds because we're considering the absolute value, but since all the cosines are positive in the first and fourth quadrants, and 14π/15 is in the second quadrant where cosine is negative. Wait, hold on.

Wait, 14π/15 is in the second quadrant, so cos(14π/15) is negative. Similarly, 8π/15 is in the first quadrant, so it's positive. 4π/15 and 2π/15 are also in the first quadrant, so positive. So, the product would be positive * positive * positive * negative = negative. But according to the identity, we have sin(32π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16, which is positive. That's a contradiction because the product should be negative.

Hmm, so I must have made a mistake somewhere. Let me check.

Wait, when I converted 16π/15 to 14π/15, I used the identity cos(θ) = cos(-θ), but 16π/15 is actually equal to π + π/15, so it's in the third quadrant where cosine is negative. Similarly, 14π/15 is in the second quadrant where cosine is also negative. So, cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15). Similarly, cos(14π/15) = cos(π - π/15) = -cos(π/15). So, both cos(16π/15) and cos(14π/15) are equal to -cos(π/15). Therefore, when I replaced cos(16π/15) with cos(14π/15), I should have considered the sign.

Wait, let's clarify:

cos(16π/15) = cos(π + π/15) = -cos(π/15)

cos(14π/15) = cos(π - π/15) = -cos(π/15)

So, both are equal to -cos(π/15). Therefore, cos(16π/15) = cos(14π/15). But wait, cos(16π/15) is in the third quadrant, so it's negative, and cos(14π/15) is in the second quadrant, also negative. So, they are equal in magnitude but both negative. So, cos(16π/15) = cos(14π/15) in terms of magnitude, but both are negative. So, when I replaced cos(16π/15) with cos(14π/15), I didn't change the value because both are equal. So, the product remains the same.

But then, according to the identity, the product is 1/16, which is positive, but the actual product is negative because we have an even number of negative terms? Wait, no, let's count:

cos(2π/15): positive (first quadrant)

cos(4π/15): positive (first quadrant)

cos(8π/15): positive (first quadrant, since 8π/15 ≈ 1.675 radians < π/2 ≈ 1.5708? Wait, no, 8π/15 is approximately 1.675, which is greater than π/2 (≈1.5708) but less than π (≈3.1416). So, 8π/15 is in the second quadrant, so cosine is negative.

Wait, hold on. 8π/15 is approximately 1.675 radians, which is more than π/2 (≈1.5708) but less than π (≈3.1416). So, it's in the second quadrant, so cos(8π/15) is negative.

Similarly, 16π/15 is approximately 3.351 radians, which is more than π (≈3.1416) but less than 3π/2 (≈4.7124). So, it's in the third quadrant, where cosine is negative.

So, in the original product:

cos(2π/15): positive

cos(4π/15): positive

cos(8π/15): negative

cos(16π/15): negative

So, the product is positive * positive * negative * negative = positive. So, the product should be positive, which aligns with the identity's result of 1/16. So, that's consistent.

Wait, but earlier I thought cos(8π/15) is in the second quadrant, so negative, and cos(16π/15) is in the third quadrant, also negative. So, two negative terms, which multiply to positive. So, overall, the product is positive, which matches the identity's result of 1/16.

Therefore, the product is indeed 1/16.

But let me double-check the identity to make sure I applied it correctly. The identity is:

Product_{k=0}^{n-1} cos(2^k x) = sin(2^n x) / (2^n sin x)

In our case, n=4, so the product is cos(x) * cos(2x) * cos(4x) * cos(8x) = sin(16x)/(16 sin x)

First, let me visualize the triangle. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the base is BC, and the altitude from A to BC is AM, which is 11 units. Point D is somewhere on AM, closer to A since AD is 10, so DM must be 1 unit because AM is 11. So, D is just 1 unit away from M.

Given that angle BDC is three times angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ. Then angle BDC is 3θ. I need to relate these angles somehow.

Since ABC is isosceles, angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote each of those as φ. So, in triangle ABC, the sum of angles is θ + 2φ = 180°, which means φ = (180° - θ)/2.

Now, looking at triangle BDC. Points B, D, and C form triangle BDC. I know angle BDC is 3θ, and I need to find some relations in this triangle. Maybe I can use the Law of Sines or Law of Cosines here.

But before that, let me note down the coordinates of the points to make it easier. Let me place point A at (0,11), M at (0,0) since it's the midpoint of BC, and then B and C will be at (-x, 0) and (x, 0) respectively for some x. Point D is on AM, 10 units from A, so since AM is 11 units, D must be at (0,1).

So, coordinates:
- A: (0,11)
- M: (0,0)
- B: (-x, 0)
- C: (x, 0)
- D: (0,1)

Now, I can compute the lengths of BD and CD. Let's compute BD first. The distance between B (-x,0) and D (0,1) is sqrt[(x)^2 + (1)^2] = sqrt(x² + 1). Similarly, CD is the distance between C (x,0) and D (0,1), which is also sqrt(x² + 1). So, BD = CD = sqrt(x² + 1).

Hmm, interesting. So triangle BDC is also isosceles with BD = CD. Therefore, angles at B and C in triangle BDC are equal. Let me denote those angles as α each. So, in triangle BDC, the sum of angles is 3θ + 2α = 180°, so α = (180° - 3θ)/2.

But I also know that in triangle ABC, angles at B and C are φ = (180° - θ)/2. So, how are these angles related?

Wait, in triangle ABC, angle at B is φ, and in triangle BDC, angle at B is α. So, angle at B in triangle ABC is φ, and angle at B in triangle BDC is α. Are these the same? No, because D is a different point. So, perhaps I need to relate these angles somehow.

Alternatively, maybe I can use trigonometric identities or the Law of Sines in triangle BDC.

In triangle BDC, sides BD and CD are equal, so it's isosceles, and angle BDC is 3θ. So, using the Law of Sines:

BD / sin(α) = CD / sin(α) = BC / sin(3θ)

But BD = CD, so BC / sin(3θ) = BD / sin(α). But BD is sqrt(x² + 1), and BC is 2x.

So, 2x / sin(3θ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / sin(α)

But from earlier, α = (180° - 3θ)/2. So, sin(α) = sin[(180° - 3θ)/2] = sin(90° - 3θ/2) = cos(3θ/2)

So, substituting back:

2x / sin(3θ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3θ/2)

Let me write that as:

2x / sin(3θ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3θ/2)

Hmm, that's one equation. Maybe I can find another relation involving θ and x.

Looking back at triangle ABC, which is isosceles with AB = AC. Let me compute AB. Since A is at (0,11) and B is at (-x,0), AB is sqrt[(x)^2 + (11)^2] = sqrt(x² + 121). Similarly, AC is the same.

In triangle ABC, using the Law of Sines:

AB / sin(φ) = BC / sin(θ)

AB is sqrt(x² + 121), BC is 2x, and φ is (180° - θ)/2.

So,

sqrt(x² + 121) / sin[(180° - θ)/2] = 2x / sin(θ)

Simplify sin[(180° - θ)/2] = sin(90° - θ/2) = cos(θ/2)

So,

sqrt(x² + 121) / cos(θ/2) = 2x / sin(θ)

Cross-multiplying:

sqrt(x² + 121) * sin(θ) = 2x * cos(θ/2)

Hmm, that's another equation. So now I have two equations:

1) 2x / sin(3θ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3θ/2)

2) sqrt(x² + 121) * sin(θ) = 2x * cos(θ/2)

I need to solve these two equations to find x and θ.

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can express everything in terms of θ and then find a relation.

Let me first work on equation 2:

sqrt(x² + 121) * sin(θ) = 2x * cos(θ/2)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

(x² + 121) * sin²(θ) = 4x² * cos²(θ/2)

Hmm, that might help. Let me note that cos²(θ/2) = (1 + cosθ)/2, and sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2). Wait, maybe I can express sin²θ in terms of cosθ.

Alternatively, let me express sinθ as 2 sin(θ/2) cos(θ/2). So, sin²θ = 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2). Let me substitute that into the left side:

(x² + 121) * 4 sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) = 4x² * (1 + cosθ)/2

Simplify both sides:

Left side: 4(x² + 121) sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2)

Right side: 4x² * (1 + cosθ)/2 = 2x² (1 + cosθ)

So, equation becomes:

4(x² + 121) sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) = 2x² (1 + cosθ)

Divide both sides by 2:

2(x² + 121) sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) = x² (1 + cosθ)

Hmm, let me note that 1 + cosθ = 2 cos²(θ/2). So, substituting that:

2(x² + 121) sin²(θ/2) cos²(θ/2) = x² * 2 cos²(θ/2)

Divide both sides by 2 cos²(θ/2) (assuming cos(θ/2) ≠ 0, which it isn't since θ is an angle in a triangle, so θ < 180°, so θ/2 < 90°, so cos(θ/2) is positive):

(x² + 121) sin²(θ/2) = x²

So,

(x² + 121) sin²(θ/2) = x²

Let me write this as:

sin²(θ/2) = x² / (x² + 121)

Taking square roots:

sin(θ/2) = x / sqrt(x² + 121)

Okay, that's a useful relation.

Now, let's go back to equation 1:

2x / sin(3θ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3θ/2)

Let me express sin(3θ) and cos(3θ/2) in terms of θ/2.

First, sin(3θ) can be written as sin(2θ + θ) = sin2θ cosθ + cos2θ sinθ.

But that might complicate things. Alternatively, use multiple-angle identities.

Alternatively, express sin(3θ) as 3 sinθ - 4 sin³θ.

Similarly, cos(3θ/2) can be expressed as cos(θ + θ/2) = cosθ cos(θ/2) - sinθ sin(θ/2).

But maybe that's also complicated.

Alternatively, let me express everything in terms of θ/2.

Let me denote φ = θ/2, so θ = 2φ, and 3θ = 6φ, 3θ/2 = 3φ.

So, equation 1 becomes:

2x / sin(6φ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3φ)

So, 2x / sin(6φ) = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3φ)

Let me write sin(6φ) as 2 sin(3φ) cos(3φ). Because sin(2A) = 2 sinA cosA, so sin(6φ) = 2 sin(3φ) cos(3φ).

So, substituting:

2x / [2 sin(3φ) cos(3φ)] = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3φ)

Simplify numerator and denominator:

2x / [2 sin(3φ) cos(3φ)] = x / [sin(3φ) cos(3φ)]

So, equation becomes:

x / [sin(3φ) cos(3φ)] = sqrt(x² + 1) / cos(3φ)

Multiply both sides by cos(3φ):

x / sin(3φ) = sqrt(x² + 1)

So,

x = sin(3φ) * sqrt(x² + 1)

Hmm, interesting. Let me square both sides:

x² = sin²(3φ) * (x² + 1)

So,

x² = sin²(3φ) x² + sin²(3φ)

Bring all terms to left:

x² - sin²(3φ) x² - sin²(3φ) = 0

Factor:

x² (1 - sin²(3φ)) - sin²(3φ) = 0

But 1 - sin²(3φ) = cos²(3φ), so:

x² cos²(3φ) - sin²(3φ) = 0

Hmm, that's:

x² cos²(3φ) = sin²(3φ)

Divide both sides by cos²(3φ):

x² = tan²(3φ)

So,

x = tan(3φ)

Since x is positive, we can write x = tan(3φ)

Okay, so x = tan(3φ). Let me note that.

Earlier, from equation 2, we had:

sin(θ/2) = x / sqrt(x² + 121)

But θ = 2φ, so θ/2 = φ. So,

sinφ = x / sqrt(x² + 121)

So,

sinφ = x / sqrt(x² + 121)

But x = tan(3φ), so substitute:

sinφ = tan(3φ) / sqrt(tan²(3φ) + 121)

Simplify denominator:

sqrt(tan²(3φ) + 121) = sqrt( (sin²(3φ)/cos²(3φ)) + 121 ) = sqrt( (sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ)) / cos²(3φ) ) = sqrt(sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ)) / |cos(3φ)|

Since 3φ is an angle in a triangle, it's less than 180°, so cos(3φ) is positive if 3φ < 90°, which I don't know yet. But let's assume it's positive for now.

So,

sinφ = [tan(3φ)] / [sqrt(sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ)) / cos(3φ)]

Simplify numerator:

tan(3φ) = sin(3φ)/cos(3φ)

So,

sinφ = [sin(3φ)/cos(3φ)] / [sqrt(sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ)) / cos(3φ)] = sin(3φ) / sqrt(sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ))

So,

sinφ = sin(3φ) / sqrt(sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ))

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

sin²φ = sin²(3φ) / (sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ))

Multiply both sides by denominator:

sin²φ (sin²(3φ) + 121 cos²(3φ)) = sin²(3φ)

Expand left side:

sin²φ sin²(3φ) + 121 sin²φ cos²(3φ) = sin²(3φ)

Bring all terms to left:

sin²φ sin²(3φ) + 121 sin²φ cos²(3φ) - sin²(3φ) = 0

Factor sin²(3φ):

sin²(3φ)(sin²φ - 1) + 121 sin²φ cos²","[121, '1) + 121']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False

"Alright, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I'm a bit nervous because inequalities can sometimes be tricky, especially with higher-degree polynomials, but I'll take it slow.

First, I notice that the expression in the middle is x⁴ + 4x². That looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it simpler. Let me try that.

So, if y = x², then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. That seems more manageable. Now, I can split this compound inequality into two separate inequalities:

1. -4 < y² + 4y
2. y² + 4y < 21

I'll solve each part separately and then find the intersection of the solutions since both conditions need to be satisfied.

Starting with the first inequality: -4 < y² + 4y.

Let me rearrange this to bring all terms to one side:

y² + 4y + 4 > 0

Wait, that's because I added 4 to both sides. So, y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Hmm, that looks like a perfect square. Let me check:

y² + 4y + 4 = (y + 2)²

Yes, that's correct. So, the inequality becomes (y + 2)² > 0. Now, a square is always non-negative, and it's only equal to zero when y + 2 = 0, which is y = -2. So, (y + 2)² > 0 means y ≠ -2. But since y = x², and x² is always non-negative, y can't be negative. So, y is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, y ≠ -2 is automatically satisfied because y can't be -2. So, the first inequality doesn't restrict y any further. It just tells us that y can be any real number except -2, but since y is x², which is non-negative, this condition is always true. So, the first inequality doesn't impose any new restrictions.

Now, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.

Again, let's bring all terms to one side:

y² + 4y - 21 < 0

Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. First, let's find the roots of the quadratic equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a)

Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.

So, discriminant D = b² - 4ac = 16 - 4(1)(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100.

That's a perfect square, so the roots are:

y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2

Calculating both roots:

First root: (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3

Second root: (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7

So, the quadratic can be factored as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.

Now, to solve the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0, I can use a sign chart.

The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3. These divide the number line into three intervals:

1. y < -7
2. -7 < y < 3
3. y > 3

Now, let's test each interval:

1. For y < -7, say y = -8: (-8 - 3)(-8 + 7) = (-11)(-1) = 11 > 0
2. For -7 < y < 3, say y = 0: (0 - 3)(0 + 7) = (-3)(7) = -21 < 0
3. For y > 3, say y = 4: (4 - 3)(4 + 7) = (1)(11) = 11 > 0

We are looking for where the product is less than 0, so the solution is -7 < y < 3.

But remember, y = x², which is always non-negative. So, y cannot be less than 0. Therefore, the interval -7 < y < 3 becomes 0 ≤ y < 3.

So, combining both inequalities, from the first part we had y ≠ -2 (which is always true since y ≥ 0), and from the second part, 0 ≤ y < 3.

Therefore, y must satisfy 0 ≤ y < 3.

But y = x², so substituting back:

0 ≤ x² < 3

Now, solving for x:

First, x² ≥ 0 is always true, so we focus on x² < 3.

Taking square roots on both sides:

|x| < √3

Which means:

-√3 < x < √3

So, the solution in terms of x is all real numbers between -√3 and √3.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

Starting from the original inequality: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21.

I substituted y = x², leading to -4 < y² + 4y < 21.

First inequality: y² + 4y + 4 > 0 → (y + 2)² > 0, which is always true except y = -2, but y can't be negative, so no issue.

Second inequality: y² + 4y - 21 < 0 → roots at y = 3 and y = -7, so solution is -7 < y < 3. But since y ≥ 0, it's 0 ≤ y < 3.

Thus, x² < 3 → |x| < √3.

Yes, that seems correct.

I think I'm confident with this solution. So, the values of x that satisfy the inequality are all real numbers between -√3 and √3.

**Final Answer**
The solution is all real numbers between \boxed{-\sqrt{3}} and \boxed{\sqrt{3}}. So, the final answer is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.

Wait, hold on. The user asked to put the final answer in a single box. So, I should present it as an interval.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, consider the inequality \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\):

1. Rearrange to get \(y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0\).
2. This simplifies to \((y + 2)^2 > 0\), which is always true for all \(y \neq -2\). Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, this condition is always satisfied.

Next, consider the inequality \(y^2 + 4y < 21\):

1. Rearrange to get \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\).
2. Solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]
   The roots are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\).
3. The quadratic inequality \((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\) is satisfied for \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, this interval becomes \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root, we find \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the solution is \(\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}\).","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations first to get a clear picture:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, okay. I remember that in problems involving symmetric equations, sometimes it's helpful to use symmetric sums or identities. Let me recall some relevant formulas.

First, I know that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Maybe this identity can help since I have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) and \( xyz \) given.

Let me compute \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \):

Given \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \) and \( xyz = 4 \), so:

\( 4 - 3 \times 4 = 4 - 12 = -8 \)

So, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = -8 \)

According to the identity, this equals \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). Also, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) can be expressed in terms of \( S \) and \( P \) as \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \).

So substituting into the identity:

\( -8 = S \times ( (S^2 - 2P) - P ) = S(S^2 - 3P) \)

So, \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \). Let me note this as equation (4):

4. \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \)

Now, looking at the third equation given:

\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, this looks a bit complicated. Let me see if I can factor or rewrite this expression. Notice that each term is a product of two variables, one squared. Maybe I can factor it as:

\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \)

Wait, let me check:

\( xy(y + x) = xy^2 + x^2 y \)

Similarly, \( xz(z + x) = xz^2 + x^2 z \)

And \( yz(z + y) = yz^2 + y^2 z \)

So, yes, the entire expression is \( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \). So, that's equal to 12.

Alternatively, I can factor this as:

\( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) \) ?

Wait, let me check that. Let me expand \( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) \):

First, multiply \( (x + y)(y + z) = xy + xz + y^2 + yz \)

Then multiply by \( (z + x) \):

\( (xy + xz + y^2 + yz)(z + x) \)

Multiply term by term:

- \( xy \times z = xyz \)
- \( xy \times x = x^2 y \)
- \( xz \times z = x z^2 \)
- \( xz \times x = x^2 z \)
- \( y^2 \times z = y^2 z \)
- \( y^2 \times x = x y^2 \)
- \( yz \times z = y z^2 \)
- \( yz \times x = x y z \)

So, combining all terms:

\( x^2 y + x^2 z + x y^2 + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 + 2xyz \)

Wait, so \( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = x^2 y + x^2 z + x y^2 + x z^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 + 2xyz \)

But in our third equation, we have \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). So, that's equal to \( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) - 2xyz \). Because the expansion has an extra \( 2xyz \).

So, \( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = 12 + 2xyz \)

Given that \( xyz = 4 \), so:

\( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = 12 + 2 \times 4 = 12 + 8 = 20 \)

So, \( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = 20 \)

Hmm, okay. Now, I also know that \( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) \) can be expressed in terms of \( S \), \( P \), and \( Q \). Let me recall the formula:

\( (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - xyz \)

Which is \( S \times P - Q \)

So, substituting the known values:

\( S \times P - Q = 20 \)

We know \( Q = 4 \), so:

\( S P - 4 = 20 \)

Thus, \( S P = 24 \). Let me note this as equation (5):

5. \( S P = 24 \)

So, now I have two equations:

From equation (4): \( S^3 - 3 S P = -8 \)

From equation (5): \( S P = 24 \)

Let me substitute equation (5) into equation (4):

\( S^3 - 3 \times 24 = -8 \)

So, \( S^3 - 72 = -8 \)

Therefore, \( S^3 = 72 - 8 = 64 \)

Thus, \( S = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4 \)

So, \( S = x + y + z = 4 \)

Now, from equation (5): \( S P = 24 \), so \( 4 P = 24 \), which gives \( P = 6 \)

Therefore, \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \)

Wait, let me just verify if this makes sense.

So, if \( x + y + z = 4 \), \( xy + yz + zx = 6 \), and \( xyz = 4 \), then the monic cubic equation with roots \( x, y, z \) is \( t^3 - 4 t^2 + 6 t - 4 = 0 \)

Let me see if this cubic factors nicely. Maybe it has rational roots. Let's try \( t = 1 \):

\( 1 - 4 + 6 - 4 = -1 \neq 0 \)

\( t = 2 \):

\( 8 - 16 + 12 - 4 = 0 \). Yes, \( t = 2 \) is a root.

So, we can factor it as \( (t - 2)(t^2 - 2t + 2) = 0 \)

So, the roots are \( t = 2 \), and the roots of \( t^2 - 2t + 2 = 0 \), which are \( t = [2 \pm \sqrt{4 - 8}]/2 = 1 \pm i \)

So, the roots are \( 2 \), \( 1 + i \), and \( 1 - i \). So, \( x, y, z \) are 2, 1+i, 1-i.

Let me check if these satisfy the original equations.

First, \( xyz = 2 \times (1 + i) \times (1 - i) = 2 \times (1 - i^2) = 2 \times (1 - (-1)) = 2 \times 2 = 4 \). That's correct.

Second, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \). Let's compute each:

\( 2^3 = 8 \)

\( (1 + i)^3 = 1 + 3i + 3i^2 + i^3 = 1 + 3i - 3 - i = (-2 + 2i) \)

Similarly, \( (1 - i)^3 = 1 - 3i + 3i^2 - i^3 = 1 - 3i - 3 + i = (-2 - 2i) \)

Adding them up: \( 8 + (-2 + 2i) + (-2 - 2i) = 8 - 4 = 4 \). Correct.

Third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z \)

Let me compute each term:

First, \( x = 2 \), \( y = 1 + i \), \( z = 1 - i \)

Compute \( xy^2 \):

\( 2 \times (1 + i)^2 = 2 \times (1 + 2i + i^2) = 2 \times (1 + 2i -1) = 2 \times 2i = 4i \)

Compute \( x^2 y \):

\( 4 \times (1 + i) = 4 + 4i \)

Compute \( xz^2 \):

\( 2 \times (1 - i)^2 = 2 \times (1 - 2i + i^2) = 2 \times (1 - 2i -1) = 2 \times (-2i) = -4i \)

Compute \( x^2 z \):

\( 4 \times (1 - i) = 4 - 4i \)

Compute \( yz^2 \):

\( (1 + i) \times (1 - i)^2 = (1 + i) \times (1 - 2i + i^2) = (1 + i) \times (1 - 2i -1) = (1 + i) \times (-2i) = -2i - 2i^2 = -2i + 2 \)

Compute \( y^2 z \):

\( (1 + i)^2 \times (1 - i) = (1 + 2i + i^2) \times (1 - i) = (1 + 2i -1) \times (1 - i) = 2i \times (1 - i) = 2i - 2i^2 = 2i + 2 \)

Now, let's add all these terms:

\( 4i + (4 + 4i) + (-4i) + (4 - 4i) + (-2i + 2) + (2i + 2) \)

Let me compute term by term:

1. \( 4i \)
2. \( +4 + 4i \) → total so far: \( 4 + 8i \)
3. \( -4i \) → total: \( 4 + 4i \)
4. \( +4 - 4i \) → total: \( 8 \)
5. \( -2i + 2 \) → total: \( 10 - 2i \)
6. \( +2i + 2 \) → total: \( 12 \)

So, the sum is 12, which matches the third equation. Perfect, so all equations are satisfied.

Therefore, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is indeed 6.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is \boxed{6}.
</think>

Given the equations:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

We need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[ x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \]

Substituting the given values:
\[ 4 - 3 \times 4 = -8 \]
Thus,
\[ (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = -8 \]

Let \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). We know:
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P \]

Substituting into the identity:
\[ S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \]

Next, we consider the third equation:
\[ xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) - 2xyz = 12 \]
Given \( xyz = 4 \), we have:
\[ (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = 20 \]

Using the identity:
\[ (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = S \times P - Q \]
Substituting the known values:
\[ S \times P - 4 = 20 \]
Thus,
\[ S \times P = 24 \]

We now have two equations:
1. \( S^3 - 3SP = -8 \)
2. \( SP = 24 \)

Substituting \( SP = 24 \)","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

"Alright, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions, I need to be careful about the signs of the numerator and the denominator.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

I know that the absolute value in the numerator, \(|x^2 - 81|\), is always non-negative because absolute values can't be negative. So, the numerator is either zero or positive. The denominator is \(x^2 - 36x\), which is a quadratic expression. I should factor that to find its roots.

Let me factor the denominator:

\(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\)

So, the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are the points where the denominator is zero, which means the expression is undefined at these points. So, \(x\) cannot be 0 or 36.

Now, the numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\). Let me factor that as well:

\(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). Therefore, the numerator is \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since it's an absolute value, it's always non-negative, as I thought earlier.

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)} < 0
\]

Now, since the numerator is an absolute value, it's either positive or zero. The denominator is a quadratic, which can be positive or negative depending on the value of \(x\). The inequality is asking where this fraction is less than zero, which means the fraction must be negative. Since the numerator is non-negative, the denominator must be negative for the entire fraction to be negative.

So, the fraction is negative when the denominator is negative. Therefore, I need to find the values of \(x\) where \(x(x - 36) < 0\).

Let me solve the inequality \(x(x - 36) < 0\). To do this, I can find the critical points where the expression equals zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These points divide the real number line into intervals. I can test each interval to see where the product is negative.

The intervals are:

1. \(x < 0\)
2. \(0 < x < 36\)
3. \(x > 36\)

Let me test each interval:

1. For \(x < 0\), let's pick \(x = -1\):
   \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive. So, the product is positive here.

2. For \(0 < x < 36\), let's pick \(x = 1\):
   \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative. So, the product is negative here.

3. For \(x > 36\), let's pick \(x = 37\):
   \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive. So, the product is positive here.

Therefore, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative only in the interval \(0 < x < 36\). So, the fraction \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\).

But wait, I also need to consider where the numerator is zero because the fraction would be zero there, and the inequality is strict (less than zero, not less than or equal to). The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which is when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\).

So, at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, making the entire fraction zero. Since the inequality is strict, these points are not included in the solution.

Additionally, the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so these points are excluded as well.

Putting it all together, the solution is the interval where the denominator is negative, excluding the points where the numerator is zero or the expression is undefined. So, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\), but we need to exclude \(x = 9\) because at \(x = 9\), the fraction is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check that. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). But in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), \(x = 9\) is included. So, at \(x = 9\), the fraction is zero, which is not less than zero. Therefore, we need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the solution.

Similarly, \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), so it doesn't affect our solution here.

So, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\). Therefore, the solution set is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

But wait, let me think again. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). So, in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), the numerator is zero only at \(x = 9\). So, the fraction is zero at \(x = 9\), which doesn't satisfy the inequality. Therefore, we need to exclude \(x = 9\) from the interval \(0 < x < 36\).

So, the solution is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

But let me also check if the numerator is positive in these intervals. Since the numerator is an absolute value, it's always positive except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). So, in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), the numerator is positive except at \(x = 9\). Therefore, the fraction is negative in \(0 < x < 36\) except at \(x = 9\), where it's zero.

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 36\) excluding \(x = 9\), which can be written as \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

Wait, but I should also consider the behavior around \(x = -9\). Since \(x = -9\) is not in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), it doesn't affect the solution. So, the solution is indeed \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

Let me summarize:

- The expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).
- The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but only \(x = 9\) is in the interval \(0 < x < 36\).
- The denominator is negative in \(0 < x < 36\), making the fraction negative there.
- Excluding \(x = 9\) because the fraction is zero there.

Therefore, the solution is \(0 < x < 9\) or \(9 < x < 36\).

I think that's it. Let me just write it in interval notation to make sure:

\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)
\]

Yes, that looks correct.
</think>

The solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is all real numbers between 0 and 36, excluding 0, 9, and 36. Therefore, the solution is:

"Alright, so I have this problem about a rectangular field with a running track around it. The track has two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is given as 400 meters. I need to find the maximum possible area of the field in square meters. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch it out in my mind. There's a rectangle, and around it, there's a track. The track has two straight parts and two semicircular parts. So, if I imagine looking at the field from above, the track would form a sort of oval around the rectangle. The straight parts of the track are along the length of the rectangle, and the semicircular parts are at the ends, connecting the two straight parts.

Let me denote the length of the rectangle as 'L' and the width as 'W'. The track goes around the rectangle, so the straight parts of the track are each equal to the length of the rectangle, which is 'L'. The semicircular parts are at each end of the rectangle. Since each end has a semicircle, together they make a full circle. The diameter of each semicircle would be equal to the width of the rectangle, 'W'. So, the radius of each semicircle is W/2.

Now, the total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight parts and the circumference of the two semicircular parts. The two straight parts each have a length of 'L', so together they contribute 2L to the total length. The two semicircular parts make up a full circle with radius W/2, so their combined circumference is 2π*(W/2) = πW. Therefore, the total length of the track is 2L + πW.

According to the problem, this total length is 400 meters. So, I can write the equation:

2L + πW = 400

I need to find the maximum possible area of the field. The area of the rectangle is given by A = L * W. So, I need to maximize A = L * W, given the constraint 2L + πW = 400.

This sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint. I remember from calculus that I can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or substitution to solve such problems. Since this seems straightforward, substitution might be easier here.

Let me solve the constraint equation for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for L:

2L = 400 - πW

So,

L = (400 - πW)/2

Now, substitute this expression for L into the area formula:

A = L * W = [(400 - πW)/2] * W = (400W - πW²)/2

So, A = (400W - πW²)/2

Now, to find the maximum area, I need to find the value of W that maximizes A. Since A is a quadratic function of W, and the coefficient of W² is negative (-π/2), the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

Alternatively, I can take the derivative of A with respect to W, set it equal to zero, and solve for W.

Let me do that. First, write A as:

A(W) = (400W - πW²)/2 = 200W - (π/2)W²

Now, take the derivative of A with respect to W:

dA/dW = 200 - πW

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical point:

200 - πW = 0

Solving for W:

πW = 200

W = 200 / π

Okay, so the width W that maximizes the area is 200/π meters.

Now, let's find the corresponding length L using the earlier expression:

L = (400 - πW)/2

Substitute W = 200/π:

L = (400 - π*(200/π))/2 = (400 - 200)/2 = 200/2 = 100

So, L = 100 meters.

Now, let's compute the area A:

A = L * W = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π

Hmm, 20000 divided by π. Let me compute that numerically to get an idea, but since the question asks for the answer in terms of π, I can leave it as 20000/π.

Wait, but let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I defined L as the length and W as the width of the rectangle.
2. The track has two straight sides of length L each and two semicircular ends with diameter W, so circumference πW.
3. Total track length: 2L + πW = 400.
4. Expressed L in terms of W: L = (400 - πW)/2.
5. Substituted into area: A = L*W = (400W - πW²)/2.
6. Took derivative: dA/dW = 200 - πW, set to zero, got W = 200/π.
7. Plugged back into L: L = 100.
8. Calculated area: 100*(200/π) = 20000/π.

Seems correct. But let me think again: is the track around the field, so the field itself is the inner rectangle, and the track is the outer part. So, does the width of the track affect the dimensions of the field? Wait, in the Asymptote code, it shows a rectangle with some arcs. The arcs are drawn with radius 1, but in the problem, the radius would be W/2.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the rectangle is from (0,0) to (3,0) to (3,2) to (0,2). So, the length is 3 units, width is 2 units. The arcs are drawn with radius 1, which is half the width. So, in the problem, the radius is W/2, which is consistent with what I did earlier.

So, the track is formed by two straight sides of length L and two semicircular ends with radius W/2. So, the total length is 2L + πW, which is correct.

Therefore, my calculations seem correct. So, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

But wait, let me think about whether this is indeed the maximum. Since the area function is a quadratic in W, opening downward, the vertex is indeed the maximum. So, yes, that should be correct.

Alternatively, I can use the method of completing the square or use the formula for the vertex of a parabola. The vertex occurs at W = -b/(2a) for a quadratic ax² + bx + c. In this case, A = - (π/2)W² + 200W, so a = -π/2, b = 200. So, W = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = -200/(-π) = 200/π. So, same result.

Therefore, I'm confident that W = 200/π and L = 100, giving the maximum area of 20000/π.

But just to make sure, let me compute the numerical value. π is approximately 3.1416, so 20000/3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977 square meters. That seems reasonable.

Wait, but let me think again: is the track around the field, so the field is inside the track. So, the field's dimensions are L and W, and the track is around it. So, the track's straight parts are each L, and the semicircular parts have diameter W. So, the total length is 2L + πW = 400. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, sometimes in track problems, the track has a certain width, but in this case, the problem doesn't mention the width of the track, just that it's a path around the field. So, I think my initial approach is correct.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

The maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.

Given a rectangular field with a running track around it, the track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the track is 400 meters. We need to find the maximum possible area of the field.

1. Let \( L \) be the length and \( W \) be the width of the rectangular field.
2. The total length of the track is given by the sum of the lengths of the two straight parts and the circumference of the two semicircular parts:
   \[
   2L + \pi W = 400
   \]
3. Express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
   \[
   L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
   \]
4. The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
   \[
   A = L \times W
   \]
5. Substitute the expression for \( L \) into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) \times W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2}
   \]
6. Simplify the area function:
   \[
   A = 200W - \frac{\pi}{2} W^2
   \]
7. To maximize the area, take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
   \[
   \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
   \]
8. Solve for \( W \):
   \[
   \pi W = 200 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
   \]
9. Substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
   \[
   L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
   \]
10. Calculate the maximum area:
    \[
    A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
    \]

The maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.","[20000/pi, '\\frac{20000}{\\pi}']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem here about triangle RST. It says that in triangle RST, sin R is 2/5, and I need to find sin T. Hmm, okay. Let me try to visualize the triangle first. The Asymptote code draws a right-angled triangle with a right angle at S. So, triangle RST is a right-angled triangle at S. That means angle S is 90 degrees, and the other two angles, R and T, must add up to 90 degrees because the total sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees.

Looking at the Asymptote code, it defines points T at (0,0), S at (2,0), and R at (2, sqrt(21)). So, plotting these points, T is at the origin, S is two units to the right of T on the x-axis, and R is directly above S at (2, sqrt(21)). So, the triangle has a base from T(0,0) to S(2,0), which is 2 units long, and then from S(2,0) up to R(2, sqrt(21)), which is sqrt(21) units high. Then, the hypotenuse is from R(2, sqrt(21)) back to T(0,0), which is given as 5 units long. So, the sides are 2, sqrt(21), and 5.

Wait, let me confirm that. The distance from T(0,0) to S(2,0) is 2 units. The distance from S(2,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)) is sqrt( (2-2)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2 ) = sqrt(0 + 21) = sqrt(21). The distance from R(2, sqrt(21)) back to T(0,0) is sqrt( (2-0)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2 ) = sqrt(4 + 21) = sqrt(25) = 5. Okay, that checks out. So, the sides are 2, sqrt(21), and 5.

Given that, angle R is at point R, which is the top of the triangle. So, angle R is opposite side ST, which is 2 units, and adjacent to side RS, which is sqrt(21) units. Wait, no, in a right-angled triangle, the sides are opposite and adjacent relative to the angle. So, for angle R, the sides opposite and adjacent would be relative to angle R.

Wait, let me think. In triangle RST, right-angled at S, so sides are:

- RS: from R to S, which is sqrt(21) units.

- ST: from S to T, which is 2 units.

- RT: from R to T, which is 5 units.

So, angle R is at point R, which is the top vertex. So, in triangle RST, angle R is opposite side ST, which is 2 units, and adjacent to side RS, which is sqrt(21) units. So, sin R is opposite over hypotenuse, which would be ST / RT. Wait, but in the problem, it's given that sin R is 2/5. Let me check that.

Wait, sin R is opposite over hypotenuse. The side opposite angle R is ST, which is 2 units, and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5 units. So, sin R = 2/5, which matches the given information. So, that's correct.

Now, I need to find sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is the origin. So, in triangle RST, angle T is opposite side RS, which is sqrt(21) units, and adjacent to side ST, which is 2 units. So, sin T would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is RS / RT. RS is sqrt(21), and RT is 5, so sin T would be sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me make sure I'm not mixing up anything. So, in a right-angled triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the hypotenuse. For angle R, the opposite side is ST (2 units), and hypotenuse is RT (5 units), so sin R = 2/5. For angle T, the opposite side is RS (sqrt(21) units), and hypotenuse is RT (5 units), so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, since the triangle is right-angled at S, angles R and T are complementary, meaning R + T = 90 degrees. So, sin R = cos T, and sin T = cos R. But wait, let me think about that. If R and T are complementary, then sin R = cos T, and sin T = cos R. So, if sin R is 2/5, then cos T is 2/5, which would mean sin T is sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. So, that's another way to get the same result.

Alternatively, using the sides, since we have the triangle sides as 2, sqrt(21), and 5, we can directly compute sin T as opposite over hypotenuse, which is sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me just confirm all the sides again. From T(0,0) to S(2,0) is 2 units. From S(2,0) to R(2, sqrt(21)) is sqrt(21) units. From R(2, sqrt(21)) back to T(0,0) is 5 units. So, yes, the sides are 2, sqrt(21), and 5. So, angle T is at (0,0), so the sides adjacent to T are ST (2 units) and RT (5 units). Wait, no, adjacent side would be ST, which is 2 units, and the opposite side is RS, which is sqrt(21) units. So, sin T is opposite over hypotenuse, which is sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, using the coordinates, we can compute the sine of angle T. Since angle T is at (0,0), the sides from T are along the x-axis (ST) and the hypotenuse RT. The coordinates of R are (2, sqrt(21)), so the vector from T to R is (2, sqrt(21)). The length of RT is 5, as we saw. So, the sine of angle T would be the y-component divided by the length of RT, which is sqrt(21)/5. That's another way to see it.

So, all methods point to sin T being sqrt(21)/5. Therefore, the answer should be sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my reasoning. Let me recap:

1. Triangle RST is right-angled at S, so sides are 2, sqrt(21), 5.

2. Angle R is at (2, sqrt(21)), so opposite side is ST (2), hypotenuse RT (5), so sin R = 2/5, which is given.

3. Angle T is at (0,0), so opposite side is RS (sqrt(21)), hypotenuse RT (5), so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

4. Alternatively, since angles R and T are complementary, sin T = cos R. Since sin R = 2/5, cos R = sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(21)/5, so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Yes, that all makes sense. I think I'm confident that sin T is sqrt(21)/5.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.
</think>

Given triangle \( \triangle RST \) is a right-angled triangle at \( S \). The sides of the triangle are 2, \( \sqrt{21} \), and 5 units. We know that \( \sin R = \frac{2}{5} \).

1. **Identify the sides relative to the angles:**
   - For angle \( R \), the opposite side is \( ST = 2 \) units, and the hypotenuse is \( RT = 5 \) units. Thus, \( \sin R = \frac{2}{5} \).
   - For angle \( T \), the opposite side is \( RS = \sqrt{21} \) units, and the hypotenuse is \( RT = 5 \) units.

2. **Calculate \( \sin T \):**
   - Since \( \sin T \) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse, we have:
     \[
     \sin T = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
     \]

3. **Verification using complementary angles:**
   - Angles \( R \) and \( T \) are complementary, so \( \sin T = \cos R \).
   - Given \( \sin R = \frac{2}{5} \), we find \( \cos R \) as:
     \[
     \cos R = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{4}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
     \]
   - Thus, \( \sin T = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \).

Therefore, the value of \( \sin T \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"Alright, so I have this problem here where I need to find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the curve given by the equation \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The answer is supposed to be in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. Then, I need to find \( a + b \).

Okay, let me start by understanding the problem. I need to find the point on the curve that is closest to the origin. The distance from the origin to any point \( (x, y) \) is given by the distance formula: \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since the square root function is increasing, minimizing the distance is equivalent to minimizing the square of the distance, which is \( x^2 + y^2 \). That might be easier to work with because it avoids dealing with the square root.

So, let me define the distance squared function \( D = x^2 + y^2 \). But since \( y \) is given in terms of \( x \), I can substitute that into the equation. The curve is \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), so substituting that into \( D \) gives:

\( D = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \)

Let me simplify that. First, square the \( y \) term:

\( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

So, substituting back into \( D \):

\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)

Now, I need to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( D \). To do this, I can take the derivative of \( D \) with respect to \( x \), set it equal to zero, and solve for \( x \). That should give me the critical points, which could be minima or maxima. Then, I can check to make sure it's a minimum.

So, let's compute the derivative \( D' \).

First, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \)

So, substituting back into \( D \):

\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \)

Let me distribute the \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

Combine like terms:

\( D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 + (x^2 - 3x^2) + \frac{9}{2} \)
\( D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)

Now, take the derivative with respect to \( x \):

\( D' = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) \)
\( D' = 2x^3 - 4x \)

Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \)
Factor out 2x:

\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \)

So, the critical points are at \( x = 0 \) and \( x^2 - 2 = 0 \), which gives \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimum distance. Let's evaluate \( D \) at each of these points.

First, at \( x = 0 \):

\( D = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \)

So, the distance squared is \( \frac{9}{2} \), which means the distance is \( \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Next, at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

Compute \( y \):

\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

So, the point is \( (\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).

Compute \( D \):

\( D = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \)

Similarly, at \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} \)

So, the point is \( (-\sqrt{2}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}) \).

Compute \( D \):

\( D = (-\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \)

So, both \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \) give a distance squared of \( \frac{5}{2} \), which is less than the distance squared at \( x = 0 \) which was \( \frac{9}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance occurs at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

So, the minimum distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimum distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \). Let me rationalize the denominator:

\( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \)

Wait, hold on. Let me check that again. \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \) is equal to \( \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \), which can be rationalized as \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \). So, the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

But let me double-check my calculations because sometimes when dealing with derivatives, it's easy to make a mistake.

So, starting from the distance squared function:

\( D = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \)
\( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \)
Expanding \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):
\( x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \)
So, \( D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)
Combine like terms:
\( D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \)
Derivative:
\( D' = 2x^3 - 4x \)
Set to zero:
\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \)
Factor:
\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \)
Solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), \( x = -\sqrt{2} \)

Evaluating \( D \) at these points:

At \( x = 0 \):
\( D = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(0 - 3)^2 = \frac{9}{2} \)

At \( x = \sqrt{2} \):
\( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \)
\( D = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \)

Same for \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). So, yes, that seems correct.

Therefore, the minimum distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \), which is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \). So, in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 12 \).

Wait, but hold on. Let me make sure that \( a \) is square-free. \( 10 \) factors into \( 2 \times 5 \), neither of which is a square, so yes, \( a = 10 \) is square-free. So, that should be correct.

Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is by using the formula for the distance from a point to a curve. But in this case, since the curve is a function, the method I used is appropriate.

Alternatively, I could parametrize the point on the curve as \( (x, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)) \) and then compute the distance squared as \( x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \), which is exactly what I did. So, that seems consistent.

Another way to think about it is using calculus, which I did, so I think that's solid.

Wait, just to be thorough, let me check the second derivative to ensure that the critical points at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \) are indeed minima.

Compute the second derivative \( D'' \):

From \( D' = 2x^3 - 4x \), the second derivative is:

\( D'' = 6x^2 - 4 \)

Evaluate at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\( D'' = 6(\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \), which is positive, so it's a local minimum.

Similarly, at \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\( D'' = 6(-\sqrt{2})^2 - 4 = 6(2) - 4 = 12 - 4 = 8 \), also positive, so local minimum.

At \( x = 0 \):

\( D'' = 6(0)^2 - 4 = -4 \), which is negative, so it's a local maximum.

Therefore, the points at \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \) are indeed minima, confirming that the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

So, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{12}.
</think>

To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the curve given by the equation \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by defining the distance squared function \( D \) from the origin to a point \( (x, y) \) on the curve. 

The distance squared function is:
\[ D = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \]

Simplifying this, we get:
\[ D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]
\[ D = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \]
\[ D = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( D \) with respect to \( x \):
\[ D' = 2x^3 - 4x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero:
\[ 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives the critical points:
\[ x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]

Evaluating \( D \) at these points:
- At \( x = 0 \):
  \[ D = \frac{9}{2} \]
- At \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
  \[ D = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimum distance is:
\[ \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the minimum distance is in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 12 \).

The value of \( a + b \) is \boxed{12}.","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"Alright, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise, and I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, okay. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me write down the function again to make sure I have it right:

f(x) = {
3 - x, if x ≤ 3,
- x³ + 2x² + 3x, if x > 3.
}

So, f is defined differently depending on whether x is less than or equal to 3 or greater than 3. That means I might have to consider both cases when finding the inverses.

I need to find f⁻¹(0) and f⁻¹(6), then add them together. To find the inverse function values, I need to solve for x in each case where f(x) equals 0 and 6.

Let me start with f⁻¹(0). That means I need to find all x such that f(x) = 0.

Since f is piecewise, I should check both pieces.

First, check the case when x ≤ 3. So, f(x) = 3 - x. Let's set that equal to 0:

3 - x = 0
=> x = 3

Okay, so x = 3 is a solution. But wait, I should check if x = 3 is in the domain of this piece, which it is because x ≤ 3. So, that's one solution.

Now, check the other piece where x > 3. So, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's set that equal to 0:

- x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0

Hmm, let's factor this equation. I can factor out an x:

x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0

So, either x = 0 or -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

But wait, in this case, we're considering x > 3, so x = 0 is not in this domain. So, we can ignore x = 0.

Now, solve -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

Let me rewrite that equation:

- x² + 2x + 3 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

x² - 2x - 3 = 0

Now, factor this quadratic:

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, that would be -3 and +1.

So, (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0

Thus, x = 3 or x = -1.

But again, in this case, we're looking for x > 3, so x = 3 is the boundary, but x = -1 is negative, which is not in the domain x > 3. So, neither of these solutions are valid in this piece.

Therefore, the only solution for f(x) = 0 is x = 3. So, f⁻¹(0) = 3.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. When x = 3, f(x) = 3 - 3 = 0, which is correct. And for x > 3, the equation didn't give any valid solutions, so yes, f⁻¹(0) is 3.

Now, moving on to f⁻¹(6). So, I need to find all x such that f(x) = 6.

Again, check both pieces.

First, for x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. Set that equal to 6:

3 - x = 6
=> -x = 6 - 3
=> -x = 3
=> x = -3

Okay, so x = -3 is a solution. Is x = -3 ≤ 3? Yes, it is. So, that's a valid solution.

Now, check the other piece where x > 3. So, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Set that equal to 6:

- x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Let me rearrange this equation:

- x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

Hmm, this is a cubic equation. Let me see if I can factor this.

First, let me factor out a negative sign to make it easier:

- (x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6) = 0

So, x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = 0

Let me try to factor this cubic. Maybe I can use rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Let me test x = 1:

1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 ≠ 0

x = 2:

8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root.

So, (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Using synthetic division with x = 2:

Coefficients: 1 | -2 | -3 | 6

Bring down the 1.

Multiply 1 by 2: 2. Add to -2: 0.

Multiply 0 by 2: 0. Add to -3: -3.

Multiply -3 by 2: -6. Add to 6: 0.

So, the cubic factors as (x - 2)(x² + 0x - 3) = (x - 2)(x² - 3)

So, x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6 = (x - 2)(x² - 3)

Therefore, the equation becomes:

(x - 2)(x² - 3) = 0

So, solutions are x = 2, x = sqrt(3), x = -sqrt(3)

But wait, in this case, we're considering x > 3, so x = 2 is less than 3, so it's not in the domain. Similarly, sqrt(3) is approximately 1.732, which is less than 3, and -sqrt(3) is negative, so none of these are in x > 3.

Therefore, in the x > 3 piece, there are no solutions for f(x) = 6.

So, the only solution is x = -3, which is in the x ≤ 3 piece. Therefore, f⁻¹(6) = -3.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check. When x = -3, f(x) = 3 - (-3) = 6, which is correct. And for x > 3, we saw that the equation didn't yield any solutions, so yes, f⁻¹(6) is -3.

Therefore, f⁻¹(0) is 3 and f⁻¹(6) is -3. So, adding them together: 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me make sure I didn't make a mistake.

For f⁻¹(0):

- In the first piece, x = 3 gives f(x) = 0. Correct.
- In the second piece, solving f(x) = 0 didn't give any x > 3. Correct.

For f⁻¹(6):

- In the first piece, x = -3 gives f(x) = 6. Correct.
- In the second piece, solving f(x) = 6 didn't give any x > 3. Correct.

So, adding 3 and -3 gives 0. Hmm, that seems right.

But wait, let me think again. Is there a possibility that f(x) = 6 could have another solution in the second piece? Maybe I made a mistake in factoring or solving.

Let me re-examine the equation for x > 3:

- x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Wait, no, that's not correct. Wait, the function is -x³ + 2x² + 3x. So, setting that equal to 6:

- x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6

Which rearranges to:

- x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0

I factored this as - (x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6) = 0, which is correct.

Then, factoring x³ - 2x² - 3x + 6, I found that x = 2 is a root, leading to (x - 2)(x² - 3). So, the roots are x = 2, x = sqrt(3), x = -sqrt(3). None of these are greater than 3, so no solutions in x > 3. So, that's correct.

Therefore, f⁻¹(6) is indeed -3.

So, adding f⁻¹(0) + f⁻¹(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, but is that possible? The function f is piecewise, so maybe I should check if there are multiple inverses or something. But since f is defined piecewise, each piece is a function, so each y value should correspond to at most one x in each piece.

In the first piece, f(x) = 3 - x is a linear function, strictly decreasing, so it's one-to-one. Similarly, the second piece is a cubic function. Let me check if it's one-to-one for x > 3.

Wait, the second piece is f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let me find its derivative to see if it's increasing or decreasing.

f'(x) = -3x² + 4x + 3

Set derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

-3x² + 4x + 3 = 0

Multiply both sides by -1:

3x² - 4x - 3 = 0

Using quadratic formula:

x = [4 ± sqrt(16 + 36)] / 6 = [4 ± sqrt(52)] / 6 = [4 ± 2*sqrt(13)] / 6 = [2 ± sqrt(13)] / 3

Approximately, sqrt(13) is about 3.605, so:

x ≈ (2 + 3.605)/3 ≈ 5.605/3 ≈ 1.868

x ≈ (2 - 3.605)/3 ≈ negative, which we can ignore since we're considering x > 3.

So, the critical point is around x ≈ 1.868, which is less than 3. So, for x > 3, the derivative f'(x) is:

Let me plug in x = 4 into f'(x):

f'(4) = -3*(16) + 4*(4) + 3 = -48 + 16 + 3 = -29, which is negative.

So, for x > 3, the function is decreasing because the derivative is negative. Therefore, the second piece is strictly decreasing for x > 3, so it's one-to-one in that interval.

Therefore, for each y, there is at most one x in x > 3 such that f(x) = y. But in our case, when solving f(x) = 6, we found no solutions in x > 3, so f⁻¹(6) is only -3.

Similarly, for f(x) = 0, only x = 3 is the solution.

Therefore, adding them together, 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, but let me think again. Is f⁻¹(0) = 3 and f⁻¹(6) = -3? So, 3 + (-3) = 0.

Yes, that seems correct.

But just to be thorough, let me check the function at x = 3 and x = -3.

At x = 3, f(3) = 3 - 3 = 0. Correct.

At x = -3, f(-3) = 3 - (-3) = 6. Correct.

And for x > 3, f(x) is decreasing, so as x increases beyond 3, f(x) decreases from f(3) = 0 to negative infinity. So, f(x) = 6 is not achieved in x > 3, which is why f⁻¹(6) is only -3.

Therefore, the sum is 0.

I think that's the answer. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.
</think>

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise, and we need to find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \).

1. **Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0:
     \[
     3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
     \]
   - For \( x > 3 \), solving \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \) yields no solutions greater than 3.
   - Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \):**
   - For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6:
     \[
     3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
     \]
   - For \( x > 3 \), solving \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \) yields no solutions greater than 3.
   - Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results together:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

"Alright, so I've got this problem here about a regular octahedron. Hmm, okay, a regular octahedron is one of the Platonic solids, right? It has eight triangular faces, twelve edges, and six vertices. I remember that in a regular octahedron, all the edges are of equal length, and each face is an equilateral triangle. 

The problem says that from one point P inside the octahedron, the distances to five of its vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 units. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. 

First, I should probably visualize the octahedron. The Asymptote code provided draws a 3D figure with points A, B, C, D, E, F, and P. From the code, it looks like A is at (1,0,0), B at (-1,0,0), C at (0,1,0), D at (0,-1,0), E at (0,0,1), and F at (0,0,-1). So, it's centered at the origin, and each vertex is along one of the coordinate axes, either positive or negative. 

Point P is at (1.2, 1.5, 1). Wait, but in the problem statement, P is just some point inside the octahedron, not necessarily at that specific coordinate. So, maybe the Asymptote code is just an example. 

I think the key here is to use some geometric properties of the octahedron. Since it's regular, it's symmetric, and all the vertices are equidistant from the center. The center is at the origin, so each vertex is at a distance of 1 from the origin if we consider the octahedron inscribed in a unit sphere. But in this case, the distances from P to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and we need to find the sixth. 

Wait, hold on. If the octahedron is regular, then all its vertices are equidistant from the center. So, if we consider the center as the origin, each vertex is at a distance of, say, 'a' from the origin. But in the Asymptote code, the vertices are at (1,0,0), etc., so the distance from the origin is 1. But in the problem, the distances from P to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11. So, maybe the octahedron is scaled up? Or perhaps the distances are not from the origin but from point P.

Wait, no. The problem says the distances from P to five vertices are 3,7,8,9,11. So, P is inside the octahedron, and we need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex.

I remember that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any interior point to the vertices is constant. Is that true? Let me think. For a regular octahedron, which is dual to a cube, there might be some properties similar to the ones in a cube.

Wait, in a cube, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant, right? It's something like 6 times the square of the edge length plus 6 times the square of the distance from the center. But is there a similar property for an octahedron?

Let me try to recall. For a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices might also be constant. Let me check.

Suppose the octahedron is centered at the origin, with vertices at (±1, 0, 0), (0, ±1, 0), and (0, 0, ±1). Let P be a point (x, y, z). Then, the distances from P to each vertex are:

- To (1,0,0): sqrt((x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)
- To (-1,0,0): sqrt((x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2)
- To (0,1,0): sqrt(x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2)
- To (0,-1,0): sqrt(x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2)
- To (0,0,1): sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2)
- To (0,0,-1): sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2)

If I square these distances, I get:

- (x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
- (x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
- x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2
- x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2
- x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2
- x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2

If I sum all these squared distances, let's compute:

Sum = [(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2]

Let's expand each term:

First term: (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
Second term: (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
Third term: x^2 + (y^2 - 2y + 1) + z^2
Fourth term: x^2 + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + z^2
Fifth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1)
Sixth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1)

Now, let's add them all up:

Sum = [x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1]

Now, let's combine like terms:

For x^2: There are 6 terms, each with x^2, so 6x^2.

For y^2: Similarly, 6y^2.

For z^2: Similarly, 6z^2.

For the linear terms:

-2x + 2x -2y + 2y -2z + 2z. These all cancel out.

For constants: Each term has a +1, and there are 6 terms, so 6*1 = 6.

So, Sum = 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6.

But wait, 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 is 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2). So, Sum = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 6.

But x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is the square of the distance from P to the origin, right? Let's denote that as d^2, where d is the distance from P to the center.

So, Sum = 6d^2 + 6.

But in our case, the octahedron might not be of edge length sqrt(2), because in the Asymptote code, the vertices are at (1,0,0), etc., which would make the edge length sqrt[(1-(-1))^2 + 0 + 0] = sqrt(4) = 2. Wait, no, the edge length is the distance between two adjacent vertices. For example, between (1,0,0) and (0,1,0) is sqrt[(1-0)^2 + (0-1)^2 + 0] = sqrt(2). So, edge length is sqrt(2). 

But in any case, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point P to the six vertices is 6d^2 + 6, where d is the distance from P to the center.

Wait, but in our problem, the distances are given as 3,7,8,9,11, and we need to find the sixth. So, if I denote the sixth distance as 'k', then the sum of the squares is 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + k^2.

Let me compute that:

3^2 = 9

7^2 = 49

8^2 = 64

9^2 = 81

11^2 = 121

So, sum of these is 9 + 49 = 58; 58 + 64 = 122; 122 + 81 = 203; 203 + 121 = 324.

So, 324 + k^2 = 6d^2 + 6.

But wait, in our earlier calculation, the sum is 6d^2 + 6. So, 324 + k^2 = 6d^2 + 6.

But we don't know d, the distance from P to the center. Hmm, so maybe we need another approach.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the octahedron is defined with vertices at (1,0,0), etc., so the edge length is sqrt(2), as I thought earlier. So, the distance from the center to each vertex is 1. So, if the octahedron is scaled such that the distance from center to vertex is 1, then the sum of the squares of the distances from any point P to the six vertices is 6d^2 + 6, where d is the distance from P to the center.

But in our problem, the distances are 3,7,8,9,11, and k. So, if we can find d, we can find k.

But we don't know d. Hmm. Is there another way?

Wait, maybe the octahedron is scaled. Because in the Asymptote code, the vertices are at distance 1 from the center, but in our problem, the distances from P to the vertices are 3,7,8,9,11, which are all larger than 1. So, perhaps the octahedron is scaled by some factor.

Let me think. Suppose the octahedron is scaled by a factor 's', so that the distance from the center to each vertex is 's' instead of 1. Then, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point P to the six vertices would be 6d^2 + 6s^2, where d is the distance from P to the center.

Wait, let me verify that. If each vertex is scaled by 's', then the coordinates become (s,0,0), (-s,0,0), etc. Then, the distance from P=(x,y,z) to (s,0,0) is sqrt((x-s)^2 + y^2 + z^2). Squaring that gives (x-s)^2 + y^2 + z^2. Similarly for the others.

Summing all six squared distances:

Sum = [(x-s)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x+s)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y-s)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y+s)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z-s)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z+s)^2]

Expanding each term:

First term: x^2 - 2sx + s^2 + y^2 + z^2

Second term: x^2 + 2sx + s^2 + y^2 + z^2

Third term: x^2 + y^2 - 2sy + s^2 + z^2

Fourth term: x^2 + y^2 + 2sy + s^2 + z^2

Fifth term: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2sz + s^2

Sixth term: x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2sz + s^2

Adding all these up:

Sum = [x^2 - 2sx + s^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + 2sx + s^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 - 2sy + s^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + 2sy + s^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2sz + s^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2sz + s^2]

Combine like terms:

x^2 terms: 6x^2

y^2 terms: 6y^2

z^2 terms: 6z^2

Linear terms: -2sx + 2sx -2sy + 2sy -2sz + 2sz = 0

Constants: 6s^2

So, Sum = 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6s^2

But x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is d^2, the square of the distance from P to the center. So, Sum = 6d^2 + 6s^2.

Therefore, in our problem, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to the six vertices is 6d^2 + 6s^2.

But we don't know 's' or 'd'. However, in the Asymptote code, the octahedron is of edge length sqrt(2), with vertices at distance 1 from the center. So, if our octahedron is scaled by a factor 's', then the edge length","[1, '1']",\sqrt{66},[],False

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find how many common digits are there between the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number 629. Hmm, okay, let me break this down step by step.

First, I think I need to convert 629 from base 10 to base 7 and base 8 separately. Then, once I have both representations, I can compare the digits to see which ones are common. That makes sense.

Starting with converting 629 to base 7. I remember that to convert a decimal number to another base, I can use the division method where I divide the number by the base and keep track of the remainders. Let me try that.

So, 629 divided by 7. Let me calculate that. 7 goes into 629 how many times? Well, 7 times 80 is 560, right? So 7*80=560. Subtracting that from 629 gives 629-560=69. Now, 7 goes into 69 exactly 9 times because 7*9=63, but wait, 7*9 is 63, which is less than 69. Wait, no, 7*9 is 63, so 69-63=6. So the first remainder is 6. Then, I take the quotient, which was 89 (since 629 divided by 7 is 89 with a remainder of 6). Now, I need to divide 89 by 7.

89 divided by 7 is 12 with a remainder. 7*12=84, so 89-84=5. So the next remainder is 5. Now, take the quotient 12 and divide by 7. 7 goes into 12 once, with a remainder of 5 because 7*1=7, so 12-7=5. So the next remainder is 5. Now, the quotient is 1, which when divided by 7 gives 0 with a remainder of 1. So the remainders, from last to first, are 1, 5, 5, 6. Therefore, 629 in base 7 is 1 5 5 6, which is 1556 base 7. Let me double-check that.

Calculating 1*7^3 + 5*7^2 + 5*7 + 6. 7^3 is 343, so 1*343=343. 7^2 is 49, so 5*49=245. 5*7=35, and 6 is 6. Adding them up: 343 + 245 is 588, plus 35 is 623, plus 6 is 629. Perfect, that checks out.

Now, moving on to base 8. Let me convert 629 to base 8. Again, using the division method. 629 divided by 8. 8*78=624, so 629-624=5. So the first remainder is 5. The quotient is 78. Now, divide 78 by 8. 8*9=72, so 78-72=6. Remainder is 6. Quotient is 9. Divide 9 by 8, which is 1 with a remainder of 1. Then, divide 1 by 8, which is 0 with a remainder of 1. So the remainders, from last to first, are 1, 1, 6, 5. Therefore, 629 in base 8 is 1 1 6 5, which is 1165 base 8. Let me verify that.

Calculating 1*8^3 + 1*8^2 + 6*8 +5. 8^3 is 512, so 1*512=512. 8^2 is 64, so 1*64=64. 6*8=48, and 5 is 5. Adding them up: 512 +64=576, plus 48=624, plus 5=629. Perfect, that's correct.

So now, I have the base 7 representation as 1556 and base 8 as 1165. Now, I need to find the common digits between these two numbers. Let's list out the digits in each.

Base 7: 1, 5, 5, 6.

Base 8: 1, 1, 6, 5.

So, the digits in base 7 are 1, 5, 5, 6. The digits in base 8 are 1, 1, 6, 5. Now, let's see which digits are common.

Looking at each digit in base 7:

- 1: Is 1 present in base 8? Yes, base 8 has two 1s.
- 5: Is 5 present in base 8? Yes, base 8 has one 5.
- 5: Again, 5 is present.
- 6: Is 6 present in base 8? Yes, base 8 has one 6.

Similarly, looking at base 8 digits:

- 1: Present in base 7.
- 1: Same.
- 6: Present in base 7.
- 5: Present in base 7.

So, all digits in base 7 are present in base 8, and vice versa. Wait, but the question is asking how many common digits are there. So, the digits that appear in both representations.

Looking at the digits, the unique digits in base 7 are 1, 5, 6. The unique digits in base 8 are 1, 5, 6 as well. So, all three digits are common. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, the problem says ""how many common digits are there in both representations."" So, it's the count of digits that appear in both, regardless of how many times they appear. So, the digits 1, 5, and 6 are present in both. So that's three digits.

But wait, let me make sure. The example given was 121 base 3 and 413 base 5, which have one common digit, which is 1. So, in that case, the count was 1. So, in our case, since 1,5,6 are all present in both, the count is 3.

Wait, but let me check the digits again. Base 7: 1,5,5,6. Base 8:1,1,6,5. So, the digits are 1,5,6 in both. So, three unique digits are common. So, the answer should be 3.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the conversion. Let me recheck the base 7 conversion.

629 divided by 7: 7*89=623, remainder 6. Then 89 divided by 7: 7*12=84, remainder 5. 12 divided by 7: 7*1=7, remainder 5. 1 divided by 7: 0, remainder 1. So, writing the remainders from last to first: 1,5,5,6. Correct.

Base 8: 629 divided by 8: 8*78=624, remainder 5. 78 divided by 8: 8*9=72, remainder 6. 9 divided by 8: 8*1=8, remainder 1. 1 divided by 8: 0, remainder 1. So, remainders from last to first:1,1,6,5. Correct.

So, digits in base7:1,5,5,6. Digits in base8:1,1,6,5. So, the unique digits common to both are 1,5,6. So, three digits.

Wait, but the example given in the problem had 121 base3 and 413 base5, which have one common digit, which is 1. So, in that case, the count was 1. So, in our case, it's 3.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says ""how many common digits are there in both representations."" So, it's the number of digits that appear in both, regardless of their frequency. So, 1,5,6 are present in both, so three digits.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not overcomplicating. The example had 121 base3 and 413 base5. The digits in base3 are 1,2,1. The digits in base5 are 4,1,3. So, the common digit is 1. So, count is 1.

Similarly, in our case, base7 digits are 1,5,5,6. Base8 digits are 1,1,6,5. So, the digits present in both are 1,5,6. So, three digits. So, the answer is 3.

Wait, but let me make sure that in the problem statement, it's asking for how many digits are common, not how many times they appear. So, it's the count of unique digits that appear in both representations. So, 1,5,6 are three unique digits common to both. So, the answer is 3.

But wait, let me think again. The problem says ""how many common digits are there in both representations."" So, it's the number of digits that are present in both, regardless of their frequency. So, yes, 1,5,6 are three digits.

Wait, but let me check if I'm not missing something. For example, in base7, the digits are 1,5,5,6. So, digits are 1,5,6. In base8, digits are 1,1,6,5. So, digits are 1,5,6. So, all three digits are common. So, the count is 3.

Yes, that seems correct. So, the answer is 3.

The number 629 in base 7 is 1556 and in base 8 is 1165. The common digits between these two representations are 1, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are three common digits.

"Alright, so I have this problem here where I'm given a function f(x) = 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Then there's another function g(x) which is equal to f(x - 1). I need to find the sum of the coefficients of g(x). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial can be found by evaluating the polynomial at x = 1. That's a useful shortcut because plugging in 1 for x essentially adds up all the coefficients. So, if I can find g(1), that should give me the sum of the coefficients of g(x). 

But wait, g(x) is defined as f(x - 1). So, g(x) = f(x - 1). That means to find g(1), I need to substitute x - 1 into f(x) and then evaluate at x = 1. Let me write that down:

g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0).

Oh, that's interesting. So, g(1) is just f(0). That simplifies things a lot because I don't have to expand the entire polynomial f(x - 1). I can just compute f(0) directly.

Let me compute f(0). The function f(x) is 3x⁴ + 5x² - 9x - 2. Plugging in x = 0:

f(0) = 3*(0)^4 + 5*(0)^2 - 9*(0) - 2 = 0 + 0 - 0 - 2 = -2.

So, f(0) is -2, which means g(1) is also -2. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is -2.

Wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. Sometimes, when dealing with function transformations, it's easy to get confused. So, g(x) = f(x - 1). To find the sum of coefficients, I plug in x = 1 into g(x), which is f(1 - 1) = f(0). That seems correct.

Alternatively, if I were to expand g(x) = f(x - 1), I would have to substitute x - 1 into f(x):

g(x) = 3(x - 1)^4 + 5(x - 1)^2 - 9(x - 1) - 2.

If I were to expand this, it would take some time, but let's see if the sum of coefficients is indeed -2. The sum of coefficients is the value when x = 1, so let's compute g(1):

g(1) = 3(1 - 1)^4 + 5(1 - 1)^2 - 9(1 - 1) - 2 = 3*0 + 5*0 - 9*0 - 2 = -2.

Yep, that's the same result. So, whether I compute f(0) directly or substitute x = 1 into g(x), I get -2. Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of g(x) is indeed -2.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning. It's a good reminder that sometimes, instead of expanding everything out, you can use properties of functions and coefficients to find the answer more efficiently.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the coefficients of \( g \) is \boxed{-2}.
</think>

To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we note that \( g(x) = f(x - 1) \). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial can be found by evaluating the polynomial at \( x = 1 \). Therefore, we need to compute \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x - 1) \), we have:
\[ g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0). \]

Next, we evaluate \( f(0) \) for the given polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) = f(0) = -2 \).

"Alright, so I have this problem where I need to find the sum of the products of the roots of a quartic equation taken two at a time, but in a specific way. The equation given is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), and the roots are \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). I need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) and then sum them up. Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for polynomials, Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. Since this is a quartic equation, Vieta's formulas will give me expressions for sums of roots, sums of products of roots two at a time, three at a time, and the product of all four roots. Maybe I can use these to find the required sum.

Let me write down the general form of a quartic equation and Vieta's formulas for it. A quartic equation is \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\), and the roots are \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). Then, Vieta's formulas tell us:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\)

In our case, the equation is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Comparing this to the general form, I can see that \(a = 2\), \(b = 0\) (since there's no \(x^2\) term), \(c = 0\) (since there's no \(x\) term), and \(d = 2\).

So applying Vieta's formulas:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

Okay, so I need to find the sum of the three expressions: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let me denote these as \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). So, I need to find \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\).

Looking at the second Vieta's formula, it gives me the sum of all possible products of two roots, which is 0. That is:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0
\]

If I group these terms differently, I can see that:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = 0
\]

But wait, that's exactly \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\)! So, does that mean \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\)? That seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Yes, because each pair of roots is being multiplied and then grouped in such a way that each term in the original Vieta's sum is included exactly once in the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\). Therefore, \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\).

But wait, the problem says ""variance"" or ""unordered sum"". Hmm, maybe I misread. Let me check the original problem again.

It says: ""வரிசையில்லாத தொகுப்பை கண்டறிக"" which translates to ""find the unordered sum"". So, it's asking for the sum of the three expressions, which is exactly what I just found as 0.

But just to be thorough, let me think if there's another way to approach this. Maybe by considering symmetric sums or something else.

Alternatively, I can think of the three expressions \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) as the elementary symmetric sums of degree 2 for the roots, but grouped differently. But in this case, since all the products are already accounted for in the second Vieta's formula, adding them up gives the total sum of all two-element products, which is 0.

Wait, but let me think again. The second Vieta's formula is the sum of all two-element products, which is 0. So, if I group them into three pairs, each pair being two-element products, then the sum of these three groups is equal to the total sum, which is 0. So, yes, \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\).

Is there a possibility that I'm missing something? For example, could the problem be asking for something else, like the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, but in a different way? Or maybe the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time, but considering different groupings?

Wait, no, the problem specifically says the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\), and then asks for the unordered sum. So, it's the sum of these three terms, each of which is a sum of two products.

So, adding them together, as I did before, gives 0. Therefore, the answer should be 0.

But just to make sure, let me consider another approach. Maybe by considering the roots and their properties.

Given the equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), perhaps I can factor it or find some relationships between the roots.

Let me try to factor the equation. Maybe it can be factored into quadratics.

Suppose \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d)\). Let's try to find a, b, c, d.

Expanding the right-hand side:

\[
(x^2 + a x + b)(x^2 + c x + d) = x^4 + (a + c)x^3 + (ac + b + d)x^2 + (ad + bc)x + b d
\]

Comparing coefficients with \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2\), we get:

1. \(a + c = 2\)
2. \(ac + b + d = 0\)
3. \(ad + bc = 0\)
4. \(b d = 2\)

So, we have a system of equations:

1. \(a + c = 2\)
2. \(ac + b + d = 0\)
3. \(ad + bc = 0\)
4. \(b d = 2\)

Let me try to solve this system.

From equation 1: \(c = 2 - a\).

From equation 4: \(b d = 2\). So, possible integer pairs for (b, d) are (1,2), (2,1), (-1,-2), (-2,-1). Let's try these.

Let me try b=1, d=2.

Then, equation 2: \(a c + 1 + 2 = 0\) => \(a c = -3\).

But since c = 2 - a, substitute:

\(a(2 - a) = -3\)

=> \(2a - a^2 = -3\)

=> \(a^2 - 2a - 3 = 0\)

Solving: \(a = [2 ± sqrt(4 + 12)] / 2 = [2 ± sqrt(16)] / 2 = [2 ± 4]/2\)

So, a = (2 + 4)/2 = 3 or a = (2 - 4)/2 = -1.

So, if a=3, then c=2 - 3 = -1.

Check equation 3: \(a d + b c = 3*2 + 1*(-1) = 6 -1 =5 ≠0\). Not good.

If a=-1, then c=2 - (-1)=3.

Check equation 3: \(a d + b c = (-1)*2 + 1*3 = -2 +3=1≠0\). Not good.

So, b=1, d=2 doesn't work.

Next, try b=2, d=1.

Equation 2: \(a c + 2 +1=0\) => \(a c = -3\).

Again, c=2 - a.

So, \(a(2 - a) = -3\)

Same as before: \(2a - a^2 = -3\) => \(a^2 -2a -3=0\), so a=3 or a=-1.

If a=3, c=-1.

Equation 3: \(a d + b c = 3*1 + 2*(-1)=3 -2=1≠0\). Not good.

If a=-1, c=3.

Equation 3: (-1)*1 + 2*3 = -1 +6=5≠0. Not good.

So, b=2, d=1 doesn't work.

Next, try b=-1, d=-2.

Equation 2: \(a c + (-1) + (-2)=0\) => \(a c =3\).

c=2 - a.

So, \(a(2 - a)=3\)

=> \(2a -a^2=3\)

=> \(a^2 -2a +3=0\)

Discriminant: 4 -12= -8 <0. No real solutions. So, discard.

Next, b=-2, d=-1.

Equation 2: \(a c + (-2) + (-1)=0\) => \(a c=3\).

Again, c=2 - a.

So, \(a(2 - a)=3\)

Same as above: \(2a -a^2=3\) => \(a^2 -2a +3=0\). No real solutions.

So, factoring into quadratics with integer coefficients doesn't seem possible. Maybe it's irreducible over integers, but perhaps can be factored into quadratics with real coefficients.

Alternatively, maybe I can use substitution to solve the quartic equation.

Let me try substituting \(y = x + k\) to eliminate the cubic term. Wait, but the cubic term is already present, so maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps using the substitution \(x = z - \frac{b}{4a}\) for quartic equations, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can write the quartic as \(x^4 + 2x^3 = -2\), and then factor as \(x^3(x + 2) = -2\). Hmm, not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, perhaps using the rational root theorem. The possible rational roots are ±1, ±2. Let me test x=1: 1 + 2 + 2=5≠0. x=-1: 1 -2 +2=1≠0. x=2: 16 + 16 +2=34≠0. x=-2: 16 -16 +2=2≠0. So, no rational roots. Therefore, it's irreducible over rationals, so factoring into quadratics with integer coefficients isn't possible.

Therefore, maybe I need to stick with Vieta's formulas.

So, going back, since the sum \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to compute this sum.

Alternatively, consider that the three terms \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the sums of products of roots two at a time, but grouped differently. So, each of these terms is a sum of two products, and when we add all three, we get the total sum of all products two at a time, which is 0.

Therefore, the sum is 0.

Wait, but let me think about the problem statement again. It says ""வரிசையில்லாத தொகுப்பை கண்டறிக"", which is ""find the unordered sum"". So, it's the sum of the three terms, each of which is a sum of two products. So, yes, that's exactly what I computed as 0.

"Alright, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. I need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to O than to any of the four corners. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the rectangle in my mind. ABCD is a rectangle, so opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center is O, which is the intersection point of the diagonals. The ratio AB/AD is given as k. So, if I let AB = k * AD, that means the rectangle is k times longer along AB compared to AD. So, if AD is the height, AB is the width, and the rectangle is k times wider than it is tall.

Now, the problem is about choosing a random point inside the rectangle and finding the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four corners A, B, C, D. So, essentially, I need to find the region within the rectangle where any point in that region is closer to O than to A, B, C, or D. Then, the probability would be the area of that region divided by the area of the entire rectangle.

Okay, so let's denote the rectangle with coordinates to make it easier. Let me place the rectangle on a coordinate system with center O at (0, 0). Since it's a rectangle, the coordinates of the corners can be defined in terms of its width and height. Let me assume that the length AB is 2a and the length AD is 2b. So, the rectangle extends from (-a, -b) to (a, b). Therefore, the coordinates of the corners are A(-a, b), B(a, b), C(a, -b), D(-a, -b). The center O is at (0, 0).

Given that AB/AD = k, so AB = 2a and AD = 2b, so (2a)/(2b) = a/b = k. Therefore, a = k*b. So, the rectangle's width is k times its height.

Now, I need to find the set of points (x, y) inside the rectangle such that the distance from (x, y) to O is less than the distance from (x, y) to any of the four corners A, B, C, D.

So, mathematically, for a point (x, y), the distance to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distance to A is sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), to B is sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²), to C is sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²), and to D is sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²).

We need the region where sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²), sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²), sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²), and sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²).

Since sqrt is a monotonic function, we can square both sides without changing the inequality. So, the conditions become:

1. x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y - b)²
2. x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y - b)²
3. x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y + b)²
4. x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y + b)²

Let me expand each of these inequalities.

Starting with the first one:

1. x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y - b)²
Expanding the right side: x² + 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b²
Subtracting x² + y² from both sides: 0 < 2a x + a² - 2b y + b²
So, 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

Similarly, let's do the second inequality:

2. x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y - b)²
Expanding: x² - 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b²
Subtract x² + y²: 0 < -2a x + a² - 2b y + b²
So, -2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

Third inequality:

3. x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y + b)²
Expanding: x² - 2a x + a² + y² + 2b y + b²
Subtract x² + y²: 0 < -2a x + a² + 2b y + b²
So, -2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

Fourth inequality:

4. x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y + b)²
Expanding: x² + 2a x + a² + y² + 2b y + b²
Subtract x² + y²: 0 < 2a x + a² + 2b y + b²
So, 2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

So, now we have four inequalities:

1. 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0
2. -2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0
3. -2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0
4. 2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

These are linear inequalities, so each represents a half-plane. The region where all four inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of these four half-planes, which should form a polygon inside the rectangle.

Let me try to find the boundaries of these inequalities by setting them equal to zero.

1. 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
2. -2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
3. -2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
4. 2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0

These are four lines. Let me write them in a more familiar form.

1. 2a x - 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide both sides by 2: a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2

2. -2a x - 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by -2: a x + b y = (a² + b²)/2

3. -2a x + 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by 2: -a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

4. 2a x + 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by 2: a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Wait, hold on, that doesn't seem right. Let me check the fourth equation again.

Wait, equation 4: 2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
So, 2a x + 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by 2: a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Similarly, equation 3: -2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
So, -2a x + 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by 2: -a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Equation 2: -2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
So, -2a x - 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by -2: a x + b y = (a² + b²)/2

Equation 1: 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) = 0
So, 2a x - 2b y = -(a² + b²)
Divide by 2: a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2

So, now we have four lines:

1. a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2
2. a x + b y = (a² + b²)/2
3. -a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2
4. a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Wait, equation 4 is a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2, which is the same as equation 2 but with the right-hand side negative. Similarly, equation 3 is -a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2, which can be rewritten as a x - b y = (a² + b²)/2.

Wait, hold on, equation 3: -a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2
Multiply both sides by -1: a x - b y = (a² + b²)/2

So, equation 3 is equivalent to a x - b y = (a² + b²)/2

Similarly, equation 1 is a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2

So, equations 1 and 3 are parallel lines, and equations 2 and 4 are also parallel lines.

Wait, let me list them again:

1. a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2
2. a x + b y = (a² + b²)/2
3. a x - b y = (a² + b²)/2
4. a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

So, equations 1 and 3 are parallel because they have the same coefficients for x and y, just different constants. Similarly, equations 2 and 4 are parallel.

So, the four lines form a parallelogram. The region where all four inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of the four half-planes, which is the interior of this parallelogram.

Wait, but in the rectangle, so the region where the point is closer to O than to any corner is the intersection of the four half-planes, which is a convex polygon, likely a smaller rectangle or a diamond shape.

But let me think about the shape. Since the four lines are two pairs of parallel lines, their intersection would form a parallelogram. But given the symmetry, perhaps it's a rectangle or a square.

Wait, let me find the points of intersection of these lines to determine the vertices of the region.

First, find the intersection of equation 1 and equation 2.

Equation 1: a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Equation 2: a x + b y = (a² + b²)/2

Let me solve these two equations.

Adding equation 1 and equation 2:

(a x - b y) + (a x + b y) = -(a² + b²)/2 + (a² + b²)/2

2a x = 0 => x = 0

Substitute x = 0 into equation 2: 0 + b y = (a² + b²)/2 => y = (a² + b²)/(2b)

Similarly, substitute x = 0 into equation 1: 0 - b y = -(a² + b²)/2 => y = (a² + b²)/(2b)

So, the intersection point is (0, (a² + b²)/(2b))

Similarly, find the intersection of equation 2 and equation 3.

Equation 2: a x + b y = (a² + b²)/2

Equation 3: a x - b y = (a² + b²)/2

Subtract equation 3 from equation 2:

(a x + b y) - (a x - b y) = (a² + b²)/2 - (a² + b²)/2

2b y = 0 => y = 0

Substitute y = 0 into equation 2: a x = (a² + b²)/2 => x = (a² + b²)/(2a)

So, the intersection point is ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0)

Next, intersection of equation 3 and equation 4.

Equation 3: a x - b y = (a² + b²)/2

Equation 4: a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Add equations 3 and 4:

(a x - b y) + (a x + b y) = (a² + b²)/2 + (-(a² + b²)/2)

2a x = 0 => x = 0

Substitute x = 0 into equation 3: -b y = (a² + b²)/2 => y = -(a² + b²)/(2b)

So, the intersection point is (0, -(a² + b²)/(2b))

Finally, intersection of equation 4 and equation 1.

Equation 4: a x + b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Equation 1: a x - b y = -(a² + b²)/2

Subtract equation 1 from equation 4:

(a x + b y) - (a x - b y) = -(a² + b²)/2 - (-(a² + b²)/2)

2b y = 0 => y = 0

Substitute y = 0 into equation 4: a x = -(a² + b²)/2 => x = -(a² + b²)/(2a)

So, the intersection point is (-(a² + b²)/(2a), 0)

Therefore, the four vertices of the region are:

1. (0, (a² + b²)/(2b))
2. ((a² + b²)/(2a), 0)
3. (0, -(a² + b²)/(2b))
4. (-(a² + b²)/(2a), 0)

So, connecting these points, the region is a diamond (a rhombus) centered at the origin, with vertices","[0, '0)\n']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False

"Alright, so I have this function f(n) defined piecewise. Let me make sure I understand it correctly. It says that if n is greater than or equal to 4, then f(n) is the floor of n. If n is less than 4, then f(n) is the ceiling of n. Okay, so floor function rounds down to the nearest integer, and ceiling function rounds up to the nearest integer. Got it.

Now, I need to compute f(π/3) + f(√45) + f(8^(2/3)). Hmm, let's break this down term by term.

First, let's tackle f(π/3). I know that π is approximately 3.1416, so π/3 would be roughly 1.0472. Since 1.0472 is definitely less than 4, I should use the ceiling function for this. The ceiling of 1.0472 is 2 because it's the smallest integer greater than or equal to 1.0472. So, f(π/3) is 2.

Next up is f(√45). Let me calculate √45. I know that 6^2 is 36 and 7^2 is 49, so √45 is somewhere between 6 and 7. To get a better estimate, 6.7^2 is 44.89, which is just a bit less than 45. 6.7^2 = 44.89, so 6.7^2 is 44.89, so 6.7^2 is 44.89, so 6.7^2 is 44.89, so 6.7^2 is 44.89. Wait, that's the same number. Maybe I should try 6.7082, because I remember that √45 is 3√5, which is approximately 6.7082. So, √45 ≈ 6.7082. Since 6.7082 is greater than 4, I need to take the floor of this value. The floor of 6.7082 is 6. So, f(√45) is 6.

Now, the last term is f(8^(2/3)). Let me compute 8^(2/3). I know that 8^(1/3) is 2 because 2^3 is 8. So, 8^(2/3) is (8^(1/3))^2, which is 2^2, which is 4. So, 8^(2/3) is exactly 4. Now, since 4 is equal to 4, I should use the floor function. The floor of 4 is just 4. So, f(8^(2/3)) is 4.

Wait a second, let me double-check that. 8^(2/3) is indeed 4 because 8^(1/3) is 2, and squaring that gives 4. So, yes, that's correct. So, f(4) is floor(4) which is 4.

Now, adding them all up: f(π/3) is 2, f(√45) is 6, and f(8^(2/3)) is 4. So, 2 + 6 is 8, and 8 + 4 is 12. Therefore, the total sum is 12.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For f(π/3), π is about 3.14, so π/3 is about 1.047, which is less than 4, so ceiling is 2. Correct. For √45, it's approximately 6.708, which is more than 4, so floor is 6. Correct. For 8^(2/3), it's exactly 4, so floor is 4. Correct. So, 2 + 6 + 4 is indeed 12. I think that's right.

I don't see any errors in my calculations. So, the final answer should be 12.
</think>

The function \( f(n) \) is evaluated for each term as follows:

1. \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \): Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function, resulting in 2.
2. \( f(\sqrt{45}) \): Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function, resulting in 6.
3. \( f(8^{2/3}) \): Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function, resulting in 4.

Adding these results: \( 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \).

"Alright, so I've got this magic square puzzle here. I remember magic squares are grids where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are all the same. The goal is to find the value of 'n' in this 3x3 magic square. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me visualize the magic square based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like it's a 3x3 grid with some numbers filled in and some expressions involving 'n'. Let me write down the grid as per the labels given:

The first row (top row) has the numbers: n-3, 3, n+1.

The second row has: n+2, 2n-9, 1.

The third row has: 2, n, n-1.

So, arranging them in a grid:

```
n-3 | 3   | n+1
n+2 | 2n-9| 1
2   | n   | n-1
```

Now, in a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals add up to the same number, which is called the magic constant. Let's denote this magic constant as S.

So, I can write equations based on the rows, columns, and diagonals.

First, let's consider the first row. The sum of the first row is (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1). Let me compute that:

(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1.

So, the magic constant S is 2n + 1.

Now, let's check the second row. The sum is (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1. Let's compute that:

(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6.

Since this is also equal to S, we have:

3n - 6 = 2n + 1.

Let me solve for n:

3n - 6 = 2n + 1  
Subtract 2n from both sides:  
n - 6 = 1  
Add 6 to both sides:  
n = 7.

Wait, so n is 7? Let me verify this because sometimes when you set up equations, you might make a mistake.

Let me plug n = 7 back into the grid and see if all rows, columns, and diagonals add up to the same number.

First, compute the magic constant S when n = 7:

From the first row: 2n + 1 = 2*7 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15.

So, S should be 15.

Now, let's fill in the grid with n = 7:

First row: 7 - 3 = 4, 3, 7 + 1 = 8. So, 4, 3, 8. Sum: 4 + 3 + 8 = 15. Good.

Second row: 7 + 2 = 9, 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, 1. So, 9, 5, 1. Sum: 9 + 5 + 1 = 15. Perfect.

Third row: 2, 7, 7 - 1 = 6. So, 2, 7, 6. Sum: 2 + 7 + 6 = 15. Nice.

Now, let's check the columns.

First column: 4, 9, 2. Sum: 4 + 9 + 2 = 15. Good.

Second column: 3, 5, 7. Sum: 3 + 5 + 7 = 15. Perfect.

Third column: 8, 1, 6. Sum: 8 + 1 + 6 = 15. Nice.

Now, the diagonals.

Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): 4, 5, 6. Sum: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): 8, 5, 2. Sum: 8 + 5 + 2 = 15.

Everything adds up to 15. So, n = 7 seems correct.

But wait, let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in my initial equations. Sometimes, when setting up equations, especially with multiple variables, it's easy to slip up.

I used the first row to find S = 2n + 1, then the second row gave me 3n - 6 = S. So, 3n - 6 = 2n + 1, leading to n = 7. That seems straightforward.

Alternatively, I could have used other rows or columns to set up equations. Let me try that to confirm.

Looking at the third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1. Which is the same as the first row, so that's consistent.

What about the main diagonal? The main diagonal is (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1). Let's compute that:

(n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13.

Since the magic constant is 15, 4n - 13 = 15.

Solving for n:

4n - 13 = 15  
4n = 28  
n = 7.

Same result. Good.

Another way: let's check the other diagonal, which is (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2.

Compute that:

(n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = n + 1 + 2n - 9 + 2 = 3n - 6.

Which is equal to S, which is 15. So, 3n - 6 = 15.

Solving:

3n = 21  
n = 7.

Consistent again.

So, all methods point to n = 7. I think that's solid.

Just to be thorough, let me check another column. Let's take the second column: 3, (2n - 9), n.

Sum: 3 + (2n - 9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6.

Set equal to S = 15:

3n - 6 = 15  
3n = 21  
n = 7.

Same result. Perfect.

I think I've verified it from multiple angles. All the equations lead to n = 7, and plugging it back into the grid confirms that all rows, columns, and diagonals sum to 15. So, I'm confident that n is 7.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To solve for \( n \) in the given 3x3 magic square, we need to ensure that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and the two main diagonals are all equal. The magic square is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline

\]

First, we calculate the sum of the first row:
\[
(n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1
\]
This sum is the magic constant \( S \).

Next, we calculate the sum of the second row:
\[
(n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must equal the magic constant \( S \), we set up the equation:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \\
n - 6 = 1 \\
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and check the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals. The magic constant \( S \) becomes:
\[
2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
\]

Checking the sums:
- First row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- First column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

All sums are equal to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct.

"Alright, so I have this problem here where ω is a cube root of unity, meaning ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, okay. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω ≠ 1. These satisfy the equation ω³ = 1, and also, I think, ω² + ω + 1 = 0. Yeah, that's right because if you factor ω³ - 1, you get (ω - 1)(ω² + ω + 1) = 0, so the non-real roots satisfy ω² + ω + 1 = 0.

So, since ω is a cube root of unity and not equal to 1, it must satisfy ω² + ω + 1 = 0. That might be useful later.

Now, the expression I need to evaluate is 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let me write that down:

S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²)

I need to simplify this expression. Maybe I can combine the two fractions. To do that, I need a common denominator. The denominators are (1 + ω) and (1 + ω²), so the common denominator would be (1 + ω)(1 + ω²). Let me compute that.

First, let's compute the numerator when I combine the fractions:

Numerator = (1)(1 + ω²) + (1)(1 + ω) = 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω²

So, S = (2 + ω + ω²) / [(1 + ω)(1 + ω²)]

Now, let's compute the denominator:

(1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1*1 + 1*ω² + ω*1 + ω*ω² = 1 + ω² + ω + ω³

But wait, ω³ = 1, so ω³ = 1. Therefore, the denominator becomes:

1 + ω² + ω + 1 = 2 + ω + ω²

So, the denominator is 2 + ω + ω², which is the same as the numerator. Therefore, S = (2 + ω + ω²)/(2 + ω + ω²) = 1.

Wait, that can't be right. If both numerator and denominator are the same, then S = 1. But let me double-check my steps because that seems too straightforward.

Let me verify the numerator:

1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = (2 + ω + ω²)/(1 + ω + ω² + ω³)

But since ω³ = 1, the denominator becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω², which is the same as the numerator. So yes, S = 1.

But wait, is that the case for all cube roots of unity? Let me test with specific values.

I know that the cube roots of unity are 1, ω, and ω², where ω = e^(2πi/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2 and ω² = e^(4πi/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.

Let me compute S for ω = -1/2 + i√3/2.

First, compute 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Similarly, 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.

So, 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). To simplify this, multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

1/(1/2 + i√3/2) * (1/2 - i√3/2)/(1/2 - i√3/2) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/(1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

1/(1/2 - i√3/2) * (1/2 + i√3/2)/(1/2 + i√3/2) = (1/2 + i√3/2)/(1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Now, adding these two results:

(1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.

So, indeed, S = 1 when ω is a primitive cube root of unity. But wait, what if ω = 1? Then, let's see:

If ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So, even when ω = 1, S = 1.

But hold on, in the problem statement, it says ω is a cube root of unity, which includes 1, ω, and ω². So, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, S = 1.

But wait, is that correct? Let me think again. If ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive root, as I computed earlier, it's also 1. So, in all cases, S = 1.

But wait, the problem says ""all possible values"". So, is S always equal to 1, regardless of which cube root of unity ω is? That seems to be the case.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently. Let me consider that since ω³ = 1, we can write ω² = ω⁻¹ because ω³ = 1 implies ω² = ω⁻¹.

So, let's rewrite the expression:

S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω⁻¹)

But 1/(1 + ω⁻¹) can be rewritten as ω/(ω + 1). So, S becomes:

1/(1 + ω) + ω/(1 + ω) = (1 + ω)/(1 + ω) = 1.

So, that's another way to see it. Therefore, S = 1 regardless of the value of ω, as long as ω is a cube root of unity.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in that step. So, 1/(1 + ω²) = ω/(1 + ω). Let me verify that:

1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1 + ω⁻¹) because ω² = ω⁻¹. Then, multiplying numerator and denominator by ω:

(1 * ω)/( (1 + ω⁻¹) * ω ) = ω/(ω + 1). Yes, that's correct.

So, adding 1/(1 + ω) + ω/(1 + ω) gives (1 + ω)/(1 + ω) = 1.

Therefore, regardless of whether ω is 1, ω, or ω², the expression S equals 1.

But wait, if ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² = 2 as well, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive root, as I computed earlier, it's also 1. So, yes, in all cases, S = 1.

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is 1.

I think that's solid. I approached it in two different ways: first by combining the fractions and simplifying, and second by using the property that ω² = ω⁻¹. Both methods led me to the same conclusion that S = 1.

So, the answer should be 1, and since the problem asks for all possible values, and it's always 1, the only value is 1.

**Final Answer**
The value of the expression is \boxed{1}.
</think>

Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, meaning \(\omega^3 = 1\), we need to find the value of the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

First, we note that the cube roots of unity satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\). 

We start by combining the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}
\]

To combine these, we find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Simplifying the numerator:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + 1 + \omega = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), the denominator becomes:

\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2} = 1
\]

We also verified this result by considering the properties of cube roots of unity and using the fact that \(\omega^2 = \omega^{-1}\). This led us to the same conclusion that the expression equals 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{1}

"Alright, so I've got this problem here with four points: A, B, C, and D. The question is asking me to figure out the shortest possible distance I can travel if I start at any one of these points and then visit the other three exactly once. It's like a traveling salesman problem but with four points instead of more. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, I need to understand the layout of these points. The Asymptote code gives me coordinates for each point. Let me jot those down:

- Point A is at (-3, 3)
- Point B is at (3, 0)
- Point C is at (0, -4)
- Point D is at (0, 0)

So, plotting these in my mind, A is in the northwest, B is to the east, C is directly south, and D is at the origin. The Asymptote code also labels some distances between the points:

- D to B is 3 units
- A to B is 6 units
- A to C is 6 units
- D to C is 4 units
- A to D is 5 units
- C to B is 5 units

Wait, hold on, let me make sure I got that right. The labels are:

- ""3"" on D--B
- ""6"" on A--B
- ""6"" on A--C
- ""4"" on D--C
- ""5"" on A--D
- ""5"" on C--B

So, the distances between the points are as follows:

- AB = 6
- AC = 6
- AD = 5
- BC = 5
- BD = 3
- CD = 4

Alright, so now I need to find the shortest path that starts at any point and visits the other three exactly once. Since it's four points, the number of possible paths is 4! = 24, but since we can start at any point, maybe we can consider each starting point and find the shortest path from there.

But wait, actually, in the traveling salesman problem, the path is a cycle, but here it's a path that starts at one point and ends at another, visiting all four. So, it's more like a Hamiltonian path. So, the number of possible paths is 4! = 24, but since we can start at any point, maybe we can fix a starting point and then find the shortest path from there.

But the question says ""start at any one of these points,"" so maybe I need to consider all four starting points and find the minimal total distance for each, then pick the smallest one.

Alternatively, perhaps the minimal path is the same regardless of the starting point, but I don't think so. Let me think.

Alternatively, maybe it's better to model this as a graph with four nodes and the given edge weights, and then find the shortest Hamiltonian path.

So, let me list all possible Hamiltonian paths and calculate their total distances. But that's 24 paths, which is a lot, but maybe I can find a smarter way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the minimal spanning tree or something, but no, that's for connecting all points with minimal total distance without necessarily visiting each exactly once.

Wait, maybe I can use the distances to find the shortest possible path.

Let me list all the possible paths starting from each point and calculate their total distances.

Starting from A:

1. A -> B -> C -> D
2. A -> B -> D -> C
3. A -> C -> B -> D
4. A -> C -> D -> B
5. A -> D -> B -> C
6. A -> D -> C -> B

Similarly, starting from B:

1. B -> A -> C -> D
2. B -> A -> D -> C
3. B -> C -> A -> D
4. B -> C -> D -> A
5. B -> D -> A -> C
6. B -> D -> C -> A

Starting from C:

1. C -> A -> B -> D
2. C -> A -> D -> B
3. C -> B -> A -> D
4. C -> B -> D -> A
5. C -> D -> A -> B
6. C -> D -> B -> A

Starting from D:

1. D -> A -> B -> C
2. D -> A -> C -> B
3. D -> B -> A -> C
4. D -> B -> C -> A
5. D -> C -> A -> B
6. D -> C -> B -> A

That's 24 paths. Now, I need to calculate the total distance for each.

But maybe I can find a pattern or a way to minimize the distance without calculating all 24.

Alternatively, perhaps I can look for the shortest possible connections.

Looking at the distances:

From A, the shortest edge is AD = 5.

From B, the shortest edge is BD = 3.

From C, the shortest edge is CD = 4.

From D, the shortest edges are BD = 3 and CD = 4.

So, maybe starting from B or D would be better since they have shorter initial edges.

Let me try starting from B.

From B, the shortest edge is BD = 3. So, B -> D.

From D, the next shortest edge is CD = 4. So, D -> C.

From C, the next shortest edge is CB = 5. Wait, but we already came from B to D to C, so from C, we can go to A or back to B, but we can't go back. So, from C, the next point is A, which is AC = 6.

So, the path would be B -> D -> C -> A. The total distance is BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

Alternatively, from B, after D, maybe go to A instead of C.

So, B -> D -> A.

From A, the next point can be C or B, but B is already visited. So, A -> C.

So, the path is B -> D -> A -> C. The total distance is BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Hmm, so 13 is better.

Alternatively, from B, instead of going to D first, maybe go to A.

So, B -> A.

From A, the next shortest is AD = 5. So, A -> D.

From D, the next is C, which is 4. So, D -> C.

Total distance: BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

Alternatively, from A, after B, go to C instead of D.

So, B -> A -> C.

From C, go to D. So, C -> D.

Total distance: BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16.

So, that's worse.

Alternatively, from B, go to C first.

B -> C.

From C, the next shortest is CD = 4. So, C -> D.

From D, go to A. So, D -> A.

Total distance: BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14.

Alternatively, from C, after B, go to A instead of D.

So, B -> C -> A.

From A, go to D. So, A -> D.

Total distance: BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

So, the best from B is 13.

Now, let's try starting from D.

From D, the shortest edges are BD = 3 and CD = 4. Let's try BD first.

D -> B.

From B, the next shortest is BA = 6 or BC = 5. Let's take BC = 5.

So, B -> C.

From C, go to A. So, C -> A.

Total distance: DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14.

Alternatively, from B, after D, go to A instead of C.

So, D -> B -> A.

From A, go to C. So, A -> C.

Total distance: DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15.

Alternatively, from D, go to C first.

D -> C.

From C, the next shortest is CB = 5 or CA = 6. Let's take CB = 5.

So, C -> B.

From B, go to A. So, B -> A.

Total distance: DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Alternatively, from C, after D, go to A instead of B.

So, D -> C -> A.

From A, go to B. So, A -> B.

Total distance: DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16.

So, the best from D is 14.

Now, starting from A.

From A, the shortest edge is AD = 5.

A -> D.

From D, the next shortest is BD = 3 or CD = 4. Let's take BD = 3.

So, D -> B.

From B, go to C. So, B -> C.

Total distance: AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Alternatively, from D, after A, go to C instead of B.

So, A -> D -> C.

From C, go to B. So, C -> B.

Total distance: AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14.

Alternatively, from A, go to B first.

A -> B.

From B, go to D. So, B -> D.

From D, go to C. So, D -> C.

Total distance: AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13.

Alternatively, from B, after A, go to C instead of D.

So, A -> B -> C.

From C, go to D. So, C -> D.

Total distance: AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15.

Alternatively, from A, go to C first.

A -> C.

From C, go to B. So, C -> B.

From B, go to D. So, B -> D.

Total distance: AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14.

Alternatively, from C, after A, go to D instead of B.

So, A -> C -> D.

From D, go to B. So, D -> B.

Total distance: AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13.

So, starting from A, the minimal path is 13.

Similarly, starting from C.

From C, the shortest edge is CD = 4.

C -> D.

From D, the next shortest is BD = 3. So, D -> B.

From B, go to A. So, B -> A.

Total distance: CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13.

Alternatively, from D, after C, go to A instead of B.

So, C -> D -> A.

From A, go to B. So, A -> B.

Total distance: CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15.

Alternatively, from C, go to B first.

C -> B.

From B, go to D. So, B -> D.

From D, go to A. So, D -> A.

Total distance: CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

Alternatively, from B, after C, go to A instead of D.

So, C -> B -> A.

From A, go to D. So, A -> D.

Total distance: CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16.

Alternatively, from C, go to A first.

C -> A.

From A, go to D. So, A -> D.

From D, go to B. So, D -> B.

Total distance: CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14.

Alternatively, from A, after C, go to B instead of D.

So, C -> A -> B.

From B, go to D. So, B -> D.

Total distance: CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15.

So, starting from C, the minimal path is 13.

So, summarizing:

- Starting from A: minimal distance 13
- Starting from B: minimal distance 13
- Starting from C: minimal distance 13
- Starting from D: minimal distance 14

Wait, so the minimal distance is 13, achieved by starting from A, B, or C.

But wait, let me double-check the paths that give 13.

From A:

- A -> D -> B -> C: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
- A -> B -> D -> C: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13

From B:

- B -> D -> C -> A: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

From C:

- C -> D -> B -> A: 4 + 3 + 6 = 13
- C -> B -> D -> A: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

So, all these paths give a total distance of 13.

Is there a way to get lower than 13? Let me see.

Looking at the distances, the minimal edges are BD = 3, CD = 4, AD = 5, etc.

If I try to find a path that uses the two shortest edges, BD and CD, which are 3 and 4.

So, if I can traverse BD and CD in the path, that would be good.

For example, B -> D -> C, which is 3 + 4 = 7, and then from C to A is 6, total 13.

Alternatively, D -> B -> C, which is 3 + 5 = 8, but that's worse.

Wait, no, D to B is 3, B to C is 5, so D -> B -> C is 8, but then from C to A is 6, total 14.

Wait, but in the path B -> D -> C -> A, it's 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.

Similarly, A -> D -> B -> C is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

So, 13 seems to be the minimal.

Is there a way to get a shorter path? Let's see.

If I can find a path that uses the two shortest edges without adding too much.

The two shortest edges are BD = 3 and CD = 4.

If I can connect them, that's 7, and then connect the remaining points with the shortest possible.
