"Okay, so I have this problem where I'm given a right triangle, and I need to find the length of side DE. The diagram shows a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E. They've given me that the sine of angle D is 0.7, and the side opposite to angle D, which is EF, is 7 units long. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me recall what sine means in a right triangle. Sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. So, in this case, sin D = opposite side / hypotenuse. The opposite side to angle D is EF, which is 7, and the hypotenuse is DF. So, sin D = EF / DF = 0.7.

So, if I write that out, 0.7 = 7 / DF. To find DF, I can rearrange this equation. DF = 7 / 0.7. Let me calculate that. 7 divided by 0.7 is the same as 70 divided by 7, which is 10. So, DF is 10 units long.

Now, I need to find DE. DE is one of the legs of the right triangle, and since we have a right triangle, I can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, DF² = DE² + EF².

We already know DF is 10 and EF is 7. Plugging those values in, we get 10² = DE² + 7². That simplifies to 100 = DE² + 49. To find DE², I subtract 49 from both sides: DE² = 100 - 49 = 51. Therefore, DE is the square root of 51.

Wait, let me double-check that. If DE² is 51, then DE is sqrt(51). That makes sense because sqrt(51) is approximately 7.141, which is a bit longer than EF, which is 7. That seems reasonable because in a right triangle, the side adjacent to the angle with sine 0.7 should be longer than the opposite side.

Alternatively, I could have used cosine to find DE. Since sin D = 0.7, then cos D would be adjacent over hypotenuse, which is DE / DF. So, cos D = DE / 10. But I don't know cos D yet. However, since sin² D + cos² D = 1, I can find cos D.

Calculating cos D: sin D is 0.7, so sin² D is 0.49. Therefore, cos² D = 1 - 0.49 = 0.51. Taking the square root, cos D is sqrt(0.51). So, DE = DF * cos D = 10 * sqrt(0.51). But sqrt(0.51) is the same as sqrt(51)/10, so DE = 10 * (sqrt(51)/10) = sqrt(51). Yep, same result.

So, both methods give me DE = sqrt(51). That seems consistent. I think that's the correct answer.

**Final Answer**
The length of DE is \boxed{\sqrt{51}}.
</think>

Given a right triangle DEF with a right angle at E, we know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and the side opposite to angle D (EF) is 7 units long. 

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Given \(EF = 7\), we can solve for the hypotenuse DF:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF} \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find DE. The theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of DE is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians in the counterclockwise direction. Hmm, okay, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that rotating a complex number around another point isn't just a simple multiplication by a complex exponential. I think I need to translate the complex plane so that the point \( c \) becomes the origin, perform the rotation, and then translate back. That makes sense because rotations in the complex plane are easier when the center is at the origin.

So, let me write down the steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \):** This will move the center \( c \) to the origin. So, I need to compute \( z - c \).

2. **Rotate the translated point by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):** To rotate a complex number by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). Since it's counterclockwise, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so the rotation factor is \( e^{i\pi/4} \).

3. **Translate back by adding \( c \):** After rotation, we need to move the center back to its original position by adding \( c \) to the result.

Let me compute each step carefully.

**Step 1: Translate \( z \) by subtracting \( c \).**

Given:
\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)
\( c = 2 - 3i \)

So, \( z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) ] \)

Simplify the real part:
\( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \)

Simplify the imaginary part:
\( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i = (-3 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = (-3\sqrt{2})i \)

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \)

Wait, let me double-check that:

Real part: \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 = \sqrt{2} \) – correct.

Imaginary part: \( - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) = -3i - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = (-3\sqrt{2})i \) – correct.

So, \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Got that.

**Step 2: Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).**

The rotation factor is \( e^{i\pi/4} \). I know that \( e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta \). So, for \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):

\( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)
\( \sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Therefore, \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

So, I need to multiply \( z - c \) by this factor.

Let me denote \( z - c = a + bi \), where \( a = \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = -3\sqrt{2} \).

Multiplying \( (a + bi) \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} \):

\( (a + bi)(\cos\theta + i\sin\theta) = a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta + i(a\sin\theta + b\cos\theta) \)

Plugging in the values:

\( a = \sqrt{2} \), \( b = -3\sqrt{2} \), \( \cos\theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), \( \sin\theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Compute the real part:
\( a\cos\theta - b\sin\theta = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (-3\sqrt{2}) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Simplify each term:

First term: \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second term: \( - (-3\sqrt{2}) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{2} = 3 \)

So, real part: \( 1 + 3 = 4 \)

Now, compute the imaginary part:
\( a\sin\theta + b\cos\theta = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (-3\sqrt{2}) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)

Simplify each term:

First term: \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \)

Second term: \( -3\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \cdot \frac{2}{2} = -3 \)

So, imaginary part: \( 1 - 3 = -2 \)

Therefore, after rotation, the translated point is \( 4 - 2i \).

Wait, let me verify that:

Real part: \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \), and \( - (-3\sqrt{2}) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \). So, 1 + 3 = 4. Correct.

Imaginary part: \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \), and \( (-3\sqrt{2}) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \). So, 1 - 3 = -2. Correct.

So, the rotated translated point is \( 4 - 2i \).

**Step 3: Translate back by adding \( c \).**

We have the rotated point as \( 4 - 2i \). Now, we need to add \( c = 2 - 3i \) to it.

So, \( w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = (4 + 2) + (-2i - 3i) = 6 - 5i \)

Wait, let me compute that again:

Real parts: 4 + 2 = 6

Imaginary parts: -2i - 3i = -5i

So, \( w = 6 - 5i \). Hmm, that seems straightforward.

But let me double-check all steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. Translating \( z \) by subtracting \( c \):

\( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \)
\( c = 2 - 3i \)
So, \( z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + [ - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i - (-3i) ] = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Correct.

2. Rotation:

Multiply \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Let me compute this multiplication step by step:

\( (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) \)

Multiply each term:

First, \( \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Second, \( \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = i \)

Third, \( -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \cdot \frac{2}{2}i = -3i \)

Fourth, \( -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3 \cdot \frac{2}{2}i^2 = -3 \cdot (-1) = 3 \)

Now, add all these terms together:

1 (from first term) + i (second term) - 3i (third term) + 3 (fourth term)

Combine real parts: 1 + 3 = 4

Combine imaginary parts: i - 3i = -2i

So, the result is 4 - 2i. Correct.

3. Translate back by adding \( c = 2 - 3i \):

\( 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i \). Correct.

So, all steps check out. Therefore, \( w = 6 - 5i \).

Wait, but just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using vectors or coordinate geometry.

Alternatively, in coordinate terms, \( z \) is a point in the complex plane, \( c \) is another point, and we're rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by 45 degrees. So, in vector terms, the vector from \( c \) to \( z \) is \( z - c \), which we've already computed as \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Rotating this vector by 45 degrees counterclockwise gives us the new vector, which we then add back to \( c \) to get \( w \). So, that's consistent with what I did earlier.

Another way to think about it is using the rotation matrix. Since complex numbers can be represented as vectors, the rotation can be done using a rotation matrix. The rotation matrix for counterclockwise rotation by \( \theta \) is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\theta & -\sin\theta \\
\sin\theta & \cos\theta
\end{pmatrix}
\]

So, if I represent \( z - c \) as a vector \( \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2} \\ -3\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} \), then multiplying by the rotation matrix with \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) should give me the rotated vector.

Let me compute that:

\[
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos\frac{\pi}{4} & -\sin\frac{\pi}{4} \\
\sin\frac{\pi}{4} & \cos\frac{\pi}{4}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\sqrt{2} \\
-3\sqrt{2}
\end{pmatrix}
\]

Compute each component:

First component (real part):

\( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \sqrt{2} + (-\sin\frac{\pi}{4}) \cdot (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Which is:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot 3\sqrt{2} \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{2}{2} + \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4 \)

Second component (imaginary part):

\( \sin\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot \sqrt{2} + \cos\frac{\pi}{4} \cdot (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Which is:

\( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (-3\sqrt{2}) \)

Simplify:

\( \frac{2}{2} - \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2} = 1 - 3 = -2 \)

So, the rotated vector is \( \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \), which corresponds to the complex number \( 4 - 2i \). Then, adding back \( c = 2 - 3i \) gives \( 6 - 5i \). So, same result. That's reassuring.

Just to make sure, let me compute the magnitude and angle before and after rotation to see if the rotation makes sense.

Original vector \( z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). Its magnitude is:

\( |z - c| = \sqrt{ (\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2 } = \sqrt{2 + 18} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \)

After rotation, the magnitude should remain the same. The rotated vector is \( 4 - 2i \). Its magnitude is:

\( |4 - 2i| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 4} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \). So, same magnitude. Good.

The angle of the original vector \( z - c \):

The original vector is \( \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \). So, in terms of angle \( \phi \):

\( \tan\phi = \frac{-3\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = -3 \). So, \( \phi = \arctan(-3) \). Since the real part is positive and the imaginary part is negative, it's in the fourth quadrant. So, \( \phi = -\arctan(3) \) or \( 2\pi - \arctan(3) \).

After rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), the new angle should be \( \phi + \frac{\pi}{4} \).

Let me compute the angle of the rotated vector \( 4 - 2i","[2, '2']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
"To simplify the square root of 242, I start by factoring 242 into its prime components. I recognize that 242 divided by 2 equals 121, and 121 is 11 squared. This means 242 can be expressed as 2 multiplied by 11 squared.

Next, I apply the property of square roots that allows me to separate the factors. The square root of 242 becomes the square root of 2 times the square root of 11 squared. Since the square root of 11 squared is simply 11, the expression simplifies to 11 multiplied by the square root of 2.

Therefore, the simplified form of the square root of 242 is 11 times the square root of 2.

To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), follow these steps:

1. **Factor 242 into its prime components:**
   
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121

   Since \(121 = 11^2\), we can rewrite 242 as:
   
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11^2
   \]

2. **Apply the square root to each factor:**
   
   \[
   \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2}

   Using the property of square roots that \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we get:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when expanding expressions raised to a power, the binomial theorem is really useful. The binomial theorem says that \((a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n - k} b^k\). So, in this case, \(a\) is \(10x^3\) and \(b\) is \(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\), right?

Alright, so I need to apply the binomial theorem here. The expansion will have terms from \(k = 0\) to \(k = 5\). Each term will look like \(\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5 - k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\). My goal is to find the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero because that's the constant term.

Let me write out the general term more clearly:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times (10x^3)^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying each part step by step. First, let's handle the constants and the exponents separately.

Starting with the constants:

- The binomial coefficient is \(\binom{5}{k}\).
- From \((10x^3)^{5 - k}\), the constant part is \(10^{5 - k}\).
- From \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\), the constant part is \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k\).

Multiplying these together, the constant part of each term is:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times 10^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k
\]

Now, let's handle the exponents of \(x\):

- From \((10x^3)^{5 - k}\), the exponent is \(3(5 - k)\).
- From \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\), the exponent is \(-2k\).

So, the total exponent of \(x\) in each term is:

\[
3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We want the exponent to be zero for the constant term, so we set up the equation:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \\
k = 3
\]

Okay, so the constant term occurs when \(k = 3\). Now, let's compute the constant term by plugging \(k = 3\) into the constant part expression.

First, compute the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5 - 3)!} = \frac{120}{6 \times 2} = \frac{120}{12} = 10
\]

Next, compute \(10^{5 - 3}\):

\[
10^{2} = 100
\]

Then, compute \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Now, multiply all these together:

\[
10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculating step by step:

First, \(10 \times 100 = 1000\).

Then, \(1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125\).

Wait, let me double-check that division. 1000 divided by 8 is 125, so with the negative sign, it's -125. That seems right.

So, putting it all together, the constant term is \(-125\).

Just to make sure I didn't make a mistake, let me recap:

1. Identified the general term using the binomial theorem.
2. Calculated the exponent of \(x\) in terms of \(k\).
3. Set the exponent equal to zero and solved for \(k\), getting \(k = 3\).
4. Plugged \(k = 3\) back into the constant part of the term.
5. Calculated each component step by step, ensuring no arithmetic errors.

Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, yeah, the constant term is \(-125\).

**Final Answer**
The constant term is \boxed{-125}.
</think>

To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the binomial theorem. The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} \times (10x^3)^{5 - k} \times \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need the term where the exponent of \(x\) is zero. The exponent of \(x\) in each term is:

\[
3(5 - k) - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting this equal to zero, we solve for \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0 \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we compute the constant term for \(k = 3\):

1. The binomial coefficient is \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\).
2. The constant part from \((10x^3)^{2}\) is \(10^2 = 100\).
3. The constant part from \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\) is \(\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}\).

Multiplying these together:

\[
10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

Thus, the constant term is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem here: I need to find the sum of a, b, and c where a and b are the vertical asymptotes and c is the horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (2x)/(x² - 5x - 14). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided that the numerator isn't also zero at those points. So, I need to factor the denominator to find those x-values. The denominator is x² - 5x - 14. Let me try factoring that.

Looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add up to -5. Hmm, 2 and -7? Because 2 * (-7) = -14 and 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes, that works. So, the denominator factors to (x + 2)(x - 7). So, the function becomes f(x) = (2x)/[(x + 2)(x - 7)].

Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at x = -2 and x = 7. So, a = -2 and b = 7. Got that part.

Now, for the horizontal asymptote. I remember that for rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator here is 2x, which is degree 1, and the denominator is x² - 5x - 14, which is degree 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0. So, c = 0.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the degree of the numerator is less than the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is indeed y = 0. If they were equal, it would be the ratio of the leading coefficients, and if the numerator's degree was higher, there wouldn't be a horizontal asymptote, but an oblique one. So, yes, c is 0.

So, now I have a = -2, b = 7, and c = 0. The problem asks for a + b + c. Let me add them up: -2 + 7 + 0. That equals 5.

Wait, is that right? Let me make sure I didn't make any mistakes in factoring. The denominator was x² - 5x -14. Factoring: looking for two numbers that multiply to -14 and add to -5. 2 and -7: 2 * (-7) = -14, and 2 + (-7) = -5. Yes, that's correct. So, the vertical asymptotes are indeed at x = -2 and x = 7.

And for the horizontal asymptote, since the numerator's degree is 1 and the denominator's is 2, it's y = 0. So, c is 0. So, adding them up: -2 + 7 is 5, plus 0 is still 5.

I think that's correct. So, the final answer should be 5.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{5}
</think>

To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we factor the denominator:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x + 2)(x - 7) \]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = -2 \) and \( x = 7 \). Therefore, \( a = -2 \) and \( b = 7 \).

For the horizontal asymptote, we compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is degree 1 and the denominator is degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Adding these values together, we get:

\[ a + b + c = -2 + 7 + 0 = 5 \]

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that for any two-dimensional vector \( \mathbf{v} \), the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

holds true. Hmm, I remember that this has something to do with the operator norm of a matrix. The operator norm, or the induced norm, is the smallest such \( C \) that satisfies this inequality for all vectors \( \mathbf{v} \). So, essentially, I need to find the operator norm of the given matrix.

Let me recall how to compute the operator norm. For a matrix \( A \), the operator norm induced by the Euclidean norm is equal to the largest singular value of \( A \). Alternatively, it can be found by computing the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). That sounds a bit complicated, but I think I can handle it.

First, let me write down the matrix \( A \):

\[
A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, to find the operator norm, I need to compute \( A^T A \). Let me compute the transpose of \( A \) first:

\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, multiplying \( A^T \) and \( A \):

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me perform the multiplication step by step.

First row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 2 \times 2 + 0 \times 0 = 4 + 0 = 4 \)

First row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 2 \times 3 + 0 \times (-2) = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times first column of \( A \):

\( 3 \times 2 + (-2) \times 0 = 6 + 0 = 6 \)

Second row of \( A^T \) times second column of \( A \):

\( 3 \times 3 + (-2) \times (-2) = 9 + 4 = 13 \)

So, putting it all together, \( A^T A \) is:

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to find the eigenvalues of this matrix because the operator norm is the square root of the largest eigenvalue. To find the eigenvalues, I need to solve the characteristic equation:

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0
\]

So, let's compute the determinant:

\[
\det\left( \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} \right) = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - (6)(6)
\]

Calculating this:

First, expand the product:

\( (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) = 4 \times 13 - 4 \lambda - 13 \lambda + \lambda^2 = 52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2 \)

Then subtract \( 6 \times 6 = 36 \):

So, the determinant is:

\( 52 - 17\lambda + \lambda^2 - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 \)

So, the characteristic equation is:

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0
\]

Now, solving for \( \lambda \):

Using the quadratic formula:

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 16}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]

So, the two eigenvalues are:

1. \( \lambda = \frac{17 + 15}{2} = \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
2. \( \lambda = \frac{17 - 15}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of 16, which is 4.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check my calculations because 16 seems a bit high. Let me verify the multiplication of \( A^T A \):

First element: 2*2 + 0*0 = 4, correct.

First row, second column: 2*3 + 0*(-2) = 6, correct.

Second row, first column: 3*2 + (-2)*0 = 6, correct.

Second row, second column: 3*3 + (-2)*(-2) = 9 + 4 = 13, correct.

So, \( A^T A \) is indeed correct. Then, the determinant calculation:

(4 - λ)(13 - λ) - 36 = (52 - 17λ + λ²) - 36 = λ² -17λ +16, correct.

Solving quadratic: discriminant is 289 - 64 = 225, sqrt(225)=15, so roots at (17 ±15)/2, which gives 16 and 1. So, yes, that's correct.

Therefore, the largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm is sqrt(16)=4.

But wait, let me think again. The operator norm is the maximum stretching factor of the matrix, so it's the maximum of ||A v|| over all unit vectors v. So, is 4 the correct value?

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it using another method to confirm.

Another approach is to parametrize the vector \( \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \), compute ||A v|| and ||v||, then find the maximum of ||A v|| / ||v||.

So, let's try that.

Compute \( A \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ 0x -2y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \)

Then, ||A v||² = (2x + 3y)² + (-2y)² = (4x² + 12xy + 9y²) + 4y² = 4x² + 12xy + 13y²

And ||v||² = x² + y²

So, the ratio is:

\[
\frac{4x² + 12xy + 13y²}{x² + y²}
\]

We need to find the maximum of this expression over all real numbers x and y, not both zero.

This is equivalent to finding the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix \( A^T A \), which we already found to be 16. So, the maximum value of the ratio is 16, so the operator norm is sqrt(16)=4.

Wait, but let me think again. If the maximum of ||A v||² / ||v||² is 16, then the maximum of ||A v|| / ||v|| is sqrt(16)=4. So, yes, that's correct.

Alternatively, maybe I can use Lagrange multipliers to maximize the function f(x,y) = 4x² + 12xy + 13y² subject to the constraint g(x,y) = x² + y² - 1 = 0.

Set up the Lagrangian:

\[
\mathcal{L}(x, y, \lambda) = 4x² + 12xy + 13y² - \lambda(x² + y² - 1)
\]

Take partial derivatives:

∂L/∂x = 8x + 12y - 2λx = 0

∂L/∂y = 12x + 26y - 2λy = 0

∂L/∂λ = -(x² + y² - 1) = 0

So, we have the system:

1. 8x + 12y = 2λx ⇒ (8 - 2λ)x + 12y = 0

2. 12x + 26y = 2λy ⇒ 12x + (26 - 2λ)y = 0

3. x² + y² = 1

Let me write equations 1 and 2 as:

(8 - 2λ)x + 12y = 0

12x + (26 - 2λ)y = 0

This is a homogeneous system, so for non-trivial solutions, the determinant of the coefficients must be zero.

So, the determinant:

| (8 - 2λ)   12     |

| 12      (26 - 2λ) |  = 0

Compute determinant:

(8 - 2λ)(26 - 2λ) - (12)(12) = 0

Let me compute this:

First, expand (8 - 2λ)(26 - 2λ):

= 8*26 - 8*2λ - 2λ*26 + (2λ)^2

= 208 - 16λ - 52λ + 4λ²

= 208 - 68λ + 4λ²

Subtract 144 (since 12*12=144):

So, 208 - 68λ + 4λ² - 144 = 0 ⇒ 64 - 68λ + 4λ² = 0

Divide both sides by 4:

16 - 17λ + λ² = 0 ⇒ λ² -17λ +16=0

Which is the same quadratic as before. So, solutions are λ=16 and λ=1.

Therefore, the maximum value of f(x,y) is 16, so the maximum of ||A v|| is sqrt(16)=4.

Therefore, the smallest such C is 4.

Wait, but just to make sure, let me test with a specific vector. Let's take a vector that might be stretched the most.

Suppose I take the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue 16. Let me find it.

From the matrix \( A^T A \), the eigenvector for λ=16.

We have \( A^T A - 16I = \begin{pmatrix} 4 -16 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 -16 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 & 6 \\ 6 & -3 \end{pmatrix} \)

So, the system is:

-12x + 6y = 0

6x -3y = 0

Which simplifies to:

-12x +6y=0 ⇒ -2x + y=0 ⇒ y=2x

So, the eigenvector is any scalar multiple of (1, 2). Let's take (1,2).

Compute ||A v|| where v=(1,2):

A v = [2*1 + 3*2, 0*1 -2*2] = [2 +6, 0 -4] = [8, -4]

||A v|| = sqrt(8² + (-4)^2) = sqrt(64 +16)=sqrt(80)=4*sqrt(5)

||v|| = sqrt(1 +4)=sqrt(5)

So, ||A v|| / ||v|| = (4 sqrt(5))/sqrt(5)=4, which matches our earlier result.

Therefore, the maximum ratio is indeed 4, so the smallest C is 4.

I think that's solid. So, the answer is 4.

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{v} \right\| \le C \|\mathbf{v}\|
\]

First, we compute the transpose of \( A \):

\[

"Okay, so I have this problem where z is a complex number such that z^5 = 1 and z is not equal to 1. I need to compute the expression z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the equation z^5 = 1 means that z is a 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation z^5 - 1 = 0. These roots can be expressed in the form e^(2πik/5) where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. Since z ≠ 1, we're looking at the roots where k = 1, 2, 3, 4.

So, z can be written as e^(2πik/5) for k = 1, 2, 3, 4. That means z is a complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane, making an angle of 2πk/5 with the positive real axis.

Now, the expression I need to compute is z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2. Let me see if I can simplify this expression. I notice that 1/z is the reciprocal of z, and since z is on the unit circle, 1/z is the complex conjugate of z. So, 1/z = \overline{z}.

Similarly, 1/z^2 is the complex conjugate of z^2. So, the expression becomes z + \overline{z} + z^2 + \overline{z^2}.

I remember that for any complex number w, w + \overline{w} is equal to 2 times the real part of w. So, applying this, z + \overline{z} = 2 Re(z) and z^2 + \overline{z^2} = 2 Re(z^2). Therefore, the entire expression simplifies to 2 Re(z) + 2 Re(z^2).

So, the expression is 2[Re(z) + Re(z^2)]. Now, I need to find Re(z) and Re(z^2) for z being a primitive 5th root of unity.

Let me write z as e^(2πik/5). Then, Re(z) is cos(2πk/5) and Re(z^2) is cos(4πk/5). So, the expression becomes 2[cos(2πk/5) + cos(4πk/5)].

Hmm, so I need to compute 2[cos(2πk/5) + cos(4πk/5)] for k = 1, 2, 3, 4. But wait, since the roots come in conjugate pairs, maybe the value is the same for k and 5 - k. Let me check.

For k = 1: cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5)
For k = 2: cos(4π/5) + cos(8π/5)
But 8π/5 is equivalent to 8π/5 - 2π = -2π/5, and cosine is even, so cos(8π/5) = cos(2π/5). Similarly, for k = 3: cos(6π/5) + cos(12π/5). 12π/5 is equivalent to 12π/5 - 2π = 2π/5, so cos(12π/5) = cos(2π/5). And cos(6π/5) is cos(π + π/5) = -cos(π/5). Wait, maybe I'm complicating things.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use some trigonometric identities to simplify cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5). Let me recall that cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]. Applying this identity:

cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5) = 2 cos[(2π/5 + 4π/5)/2] cos[(2π/5 - 4π/5)/2] = 2 cos(3π/5) cos(-π/5). Since cosine is even, cos(-π/5) = cos(π/5). So, this becomes 2 cos(3π/5) cos(π/5).

But cos(3π/5) is equal to cos(π - 2π/5) = -cos(2π/5). So, substituting back, we have 2*(-cos(2π/5)) * cos(π/5) = -2 cos(2π/5) cos(π/5).

Hmm, that seems a bit messy. Maybe there's another approach. Let me think about the sum of the roots of unity.

The sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero. So, 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0. Therefore, z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1.

But in our expression, we have z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2. Let me note that 1/z = z^4 and 1/z^2 = z^3 because z^5 = 1, so z^4 = 1/z and z^3 = 1/z^2.

Therefore, the expression z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2 is equal to z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. From the earlier equation, we know that z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1. So, substituting, the expression is equal to -1.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me verify.

Given that z^5 = 1, so z^5 - 1 = 0, which factors as (z - 1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0. Since z ≠ 1, we have z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. Therefore, z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1.

But in our expression, we have z + 1/z + z^2 + 1/z^2. As I noted, 1/z = z^4 and 1/z^2 = z^3. So, substituting, the expression becomes z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3, which is exactly z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4, which is equal to -1.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -1.

Wait, but earlier I tried to compute it using cosines and got an expression involving cos(2π/5) and cos(4π/5). Let me check if that also gives -1.

We had 2[cos(2π/5) + cos(4π/5)]. Let me compute this numerically.

cos(2π/5) is approximately cos(72 degrees) ≈ 0.3090
cos(4π/5) is approximately cos(144 degrees) ≈ -0.8090
Adding them together: 0.3090 + (-0.8090) = -0.5
Multiply by 2: 2*(-0.5) = -1

Yes, that matches. So both methods give the same result, which is reassuring.

Therefore, the value of the expression is -1.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{-1}
</think>

Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we need to compute the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, we recognize that \( z \) is a 5th root of unity, which can be written as \( z = e^{2\pi i k / 5} \) for \( k = 1, 2, 3, 4 \). The expression we need to compute is \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

Since \( z \) is a root of unity, we know that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

We also know that the sum of all 5th roots of unity is zero:
\[ 1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0. \]
Excluding 1, we have:
\[ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1. \]

Thus, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) simplifies to:
\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1. \]

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of two quadratic polynomials, right? The polynomials are given as \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\), and their product is supposed to be \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). I need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and then add them together to get \(a + b\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that when you multiply two polynomials, you have to use the distributive property, also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but since these are quadratics, it's a bit more involved. So, I should probably multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms. Let me write that out step by step.

Let me denote the first polynomial as \(P(t) = 3t^2 + 5t + a\) and the second one as \(Q(t) = 4t^2 + bt - 2\). Their product \(P(t) \times Q(t)\) should give me the given quartic polynomial. So, let's compute the product term by term.

Starting with the first term of \(P(t)\), which is \(3t^2\), I need to multiply it by each term in \(Q(t)\):

1. \(3t^2 \times 4t^2 = 12t^4\)
2. \(3t^2 \times bt = 3b t^3\)
3. \(3t^2 \times (-2) = -6t^2\)

Next, the second term of \(P(t)\) is \(5t\). Multiplying this by each term in \(Q(t)\):

4. \(5t \times 4t^2 = 20t^3\)
5. \(5t \times bt = 5b t^2\)
6. \(5t \times (-2) = -10t\)

Now, the third term of \(P(t)\) is \(a\). Multiplying this by each term in \(Q(t)\):

7. \(a \times 4t^2 = 4a t^2\)
8. \(a \times bt = ab t\)
9. \(a \times (-2) = -2a\)

So, now I have all the terms from the multiplication. Let me list them all out:

- \(12t^4\)
- \(3b t^3\)
- \(-6t^2\)
- \(20t^3\)
- \(5b t^2\)
- \(-10t\)
- \(4a t^2\)
- \(ab t\)
- \(-2a\)

Now, I need to combine like terms. Let's group them by the power of \(t\):

1. **\(t^4\) terms**: Only one term, which is \(12t^4\).
2. **\(t^3\) terms**: \(3b t^3 + 20t^3\). Combining these gives \((3b + 20)t^3\).
3. **\(t^2\) terms**: \(-6t^2 + 5b t^2 + 4a t^2\). Combining these gives \((-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2\).
4. **\(t\) terms**: \(-10t + ab t\). Combining these gives \((-10 + ab)t\).
5. **Constant terms**: Only one term, which is \(-2a\).

So, putting it all together, the product polynomial is:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

Now, according to the problem, this product is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). That means the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) must be equal. So, I can set up equations by equating the coefficients:

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\). Well, that's already satisfied, so no new information here.
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

Alright, let's solve these equations step by step.

Starting with the constant term equation:

5. \(-2a = 6\)

Divide both sides by -2:

\(a = 6 / (-2) = -3\)

So, \(a = -3\). Got that.

Now, moving to the \(t^3\) term:

2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)

Subtract 20 from both sides:

\(3b = 26 - 20 = 6\)

Divide both sides by 3:

\(b = 6 / 3 = 2\)

So, \(b = 2\). Okay, so far, \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Let me check if these values satisfy the other equations, just to make sure.

First, let's check the \(t^2\) term:

3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)

Plugging in \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):

\(-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = (-6 - 12) + 10 = (-18) + 10 = -8\)

Yes, that works out.

Now, the \(t\) term:

4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)

Plugging in \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):

\(-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16\)

Perfect, that also checks out.

So, both \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) satisfy all the equations. Therefore, the values are correct.

Now, the question asks for \(a + b\). So, let's compute that:

\(a + b = (-3) + 2 = -1\)

So, the sum of \(a\) and \(b\) is \(-1\).

Wait, just to make sure I didn't make any calculation mistakes, let me go through the steps again.

Starting with the constant term: \(-2a = 6\) leads to \(a = -3\). Correct.

Then, \(3b + 20 = 26\) gives \(3b = 6\), so \(b = 2\). Correct.

Then, plugging into the \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 -12 = -8\). Correct.

And the \(t\) term: \(-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 -6 = -16\). Correct.

So, all equations are satisfied. Therefore, \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), so \(a + b = -1\).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

**Final Answer**
The value of \(a + b\) is \boxed{-1}.

To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

First, we multiply each term in \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):

1. \(3t^2 \times 4t^2 = 12t^4\)
2. \(3t^2 \times bt = 3bt^3\)
3. \(3t^2 \times (-2) = -6t^2\)
4. \(5t \times 4t^2 = 20t^3\)
5. \(5t \times bt = 5bt^2\)
6. \(5t \times (-2) = -10t\)
7. \(a \times 4t^2 = 4at^2\)
8. \(a \times bt = abt\)
9. \(a \times (-2) = -2a\)

Combining like terms, we get:

- \(12t^4\)
- \((3b + 20)t^3\)
- \((-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2\)
- \((-10 + ab)t\)
- \(-2a\)

We equate the coefficients of the resulting polynomial to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\) (satisfied)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

Solving these equations step by step:

- From the constant term: \(-2a = 6\) gives \(a = -3\).
- From the \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\) gives \(3b = 6\) and \(b = 2\).

We verify these values with the other equations:

- For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8\)
- For \(t\): \(-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16\)

Both values satisfy all equations. Therefore, \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), so \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

"Okay, so I have this problem about a cylindrical reservoir filling up with water. The problem says that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of 20π cubic meters per hour, and as it fills, the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. I need to find the radius of the reservoir in meters and express it in the simplest radical form. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr²h, where r is the radius and h is the height. Since the reservoir is cylindrical, this formula should apply. Now, the problem is about rates, so I think I need to use related rates here. That means I should consider how the volume changes with respect to time and how the height changes with respect to time.

The rate at which the volume is increasing is given as 20π cubic meters per hour. So, dV/dt = 20π m³/h. The rate at which the water level is rising is given as 4 meters per hour, so dh/dt = 4 m/h. I need to find the radius, r, so I should relate these rates somehow.

Let me write down the volume formula again: V = πr²h. If I differentiate both sides with respect to time t, I can relate the rates. So, dV/dt = πr² dh/dt + 2πr h dr/dt. Wait, but in this case, is the radius changing? Hmm, the reservoir is a fixed cylinder, right? So the radius isn't changing as it fills up. That means dr/dt = 0. So, the term with dr/dt will disappear.

So, simplifying, dV/dt = πr² dh/dt. That makes sense because if the radius isn't changing, the rate of volume change is just the area of the base times the rate of height change. So, plugging in the known values: 20π = πr² * 4.

Let me write that equation again: 20π = πr² * 4. I can cancel out the π from both sides, so that gives me 20 = 4r². Then, dividing both sides by 4, I get 5 = r². So, r² = 5. Taking the square root of both sides, r = √5 meters.

Wait, let me double-check that. If the radius is √5, then the area of the base is π*(√5)² = 5π. Then, the volume rate would be 5π * 4 = 20π, which matches the given rate. Yeah, that seems right.

So, the radius is √5 meters. I think that's the answer. It's already in the simplest radical form, so I don't need to do anything else.

**Final Answer**
The radius of the reservoir is \boxed{\sqrt{5}} meters.
</think>

The problem involves a cylindrical reservoir being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, with the water level rising at 4 meters per hour. To find the radius of the reservoir, we use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, \(V = \pi r^2 h\), and consider the rates of change.

Given:
- The rate of volume increase, \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) cubic meters per hour.
- The rate of height increase, \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) meters per hour.

Since the radius is constant, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

Simplifying by canceling \(\pi\) from both sides:
\[
20 = 4r^2
\]

Solving for \(r^2\):
\[
r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the radius of the reservoir is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"Okay, so I have this function f(x) defined piecewise. It's ax² when x is greater than or equal to a, and ax + 2a when x is less than a. I need to find the largest value of a such that the graph of y = f(x) intersects every horizontal line at least once. Hmm, that means for every y-value, there should be some x such that f(x) = y. So, the function needs to be surjective, right? Or at least, every horizontal line must intersect the graph somewhere.

Let me think about what this function looks like. For x ≥ a, it's a quadratic function opening upwards if a is positive, or downwards if a is negative. For x < a, it's a linear function with slope a. The function is continuous at x = a because both pieces should meet there. Let me check that.

When x = a, the quadratic part gives f(a) = a*(a)² = a³. The linear part gives f(a) = a*a + 2a = a² + 2a. For the function to be continuous at x = a, these two must be equal. So, a³ = a² + 2a. Let me write that equation:

a³ = a² + 2a

Subtracting a² + 2a from both sides:

a³ - a² - 2a = 0

Factor out an a:

a(a² - a - 2) = 0

So, either a = 0 or a² - a - 2 = 0. Solving the quadratic equation:

a = [1 ± sqrt(1 + 8)] / 2 = [1 ± 3] / 2

So, a = 2 or a = -1. Therefore, the possible values for a where the function is continuous are a = 0, a = 2, and a = -1. But wait, if a = 0, then the function becomes f(x) = 0 for x ≥ 0 and f(x) = 0 + 0 = 0 for x < 0. So, it's just the zero function, which is a horizontal line. That can't be surjective because it only takes the value 0. So, a = 0 is not a valid solution for our problem.

So, the possible a's are 2 and -1. But the question is asking for the largest value of a. So, 2 is larger than -1, so maybe a = 2 is the answer? But I need to make sure that for a = 2, the function actually intersects every horizontal line.

Wait, let me think again. The function is continuous, but does it cover all y-values? For a = 2, the function is:

f(x) = 2x² when x ≥ 2, and f(x) = 2x + 4 when x < 2.

Let me analyze the behavior of this function.

First, for x < 2, it's a linear function with slope 2. So, as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. As x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 2*2 + 4 = 8.

For x ≥ 2, it's a quadratic function opening upwards. At x = 2, f(2) = 2*(2)² = 8. As x increases beyond 2, f(x) increases to infinity.

So, the function goes from negative infinity up to 8 on the left side, and from 8 to infinity on the right side. So, does this function cover all real numbers? Let's see. For y < 8, the linear part will cover all those y-values because as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity, and as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches 8. So, for any y < 8, there's an x < 2 such that f(x) = y.

For y ≥ 8, the quadratic part will cover those y-values because as x increases beyond 2, f(x) goes to infinity. So, for any y ≥ 8, there's an x ≥ 2 such that f(x) = y.

Therefore, for a = 2, the function f(x) is surjective; it intersects every horizontal line. So, a = 2 is a candidate.

But wait, what about a = -1? Let me check that too. For a = -1, the function is:

f(x) = -1x² when x ≥ -1, and f(x) = -1x + 2*(-1) = -x - 2 when x < -1.

So, for x < -1, it's a linear function with slope -1. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity (since slope is negative, going to the left, y increases). As x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -(-1) - 2 = 1 - 2 = -1.

For x ≥ -1, it's a quadratic function opening downwards (since a = -1). At x = -1, f(-1) = -1*(-1)² = -1. As x increases beyond -1, the quadratic function decreases because it's opening downward. So, as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity.

So, the function for a = -1 goes from positive infinity down to -1 on the left side, and from -1 down to negative infinity on the right side. So, does this function cover all real numbers? Let's see.

For y > -1, the left side (x < -1) will cover those y-values because as x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity, and as x approaches -1 from the left, f(x) approaches -1. So, for any y > -1, there's an x < -1 such that f(x) = y.

For y ≤ -1, the right side (x ≥ -1) will cover those y-values because as x increases beyond -1, f(x) decreases to negative infinity. So, for any y ≤ -1, there's an x ≥ -1 such that f(x) = y.

Therefore, for a = -1, the function f(x) is also surjective. So, both a = 2 and a = -1 make the function surjective.

But the question is asking for the largest value of a. So, between 2 and -1, 2 is larger. So, is 2 the answer? Wait, but I need to make sure that for a > 2, the function is not surjective. Because maybe a can be larger than 2 and still satisfy the condition.

Wait, let me think. Suppose a is larger than 2, say a = 3. Then, the function is:

f(x) = 3x² when x ≥ 3, and f(x) = 3x + 6 when x < 3.

Let me analyze this.

For x < 3, it's a linear function with slope 3. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. As x approaches 3 from the left, f(x) approaches 3*3 + 6 = 15.

For x ≥ 3, it's a quadratic function opening upwards. At x = 3, f(3) = 3*(3)² = 27. As x increases beyond 3, f(x) increases to infinity.

So, the function goes from negative infinity up to 15 on the left side, and from 27 to infinity on the right side. Wait, so there's a gap between 15 and 27. So, for y-values between 15 and 27, there is no x such that f(x) = y. Therefore, the function is not surjective for a = 3.

So, a = 3 is too big. Therefore, a cannot be larger than 2 because then the function will have a gap between the linear and quadratic parts, missing some y-values.

Wait, but when a = 2, the function is continuous at x = 2, and the linear part goes up to 8, and the quadratic part starts at 8 and goes up. So, there's no gap. So, for a = 2, the function is continuous and covers all y-values.

But for a > 2, the function is not continuous? Wait, no, actually, for a > 2, the function is still continuous at x = a because we have f(a) = a³ and f(a) = a² + 2a, which are equal when a³ = a² + 2a, which only happens for a = 0, 2, -1. So, for a > 2, the function is not continuous at x = a because the two pieces don't meet. Therefore, the function would have a jump discontinuity at x = a.

But wait, the problem didn't specify that the function has to be continuous. It just said that the graph y = f(x) must intersect every horizontal line at least once. So, even if the function is discontinuous, as long as every horizontal line intersects the graph somewhere, it's okay.

But in the case of a = 3, the function is discontinuous at x = 3, with the left limit being 15 and the right limit being 27. So, the function jumps from 15 to 27. Therefore, any horizontal line between 15 and 27 won't intersect the graph. So, the function is not surjective.

Therefore, for a > 2, the function is not surjective because of the gap. So, the maximum a for which the function is surjective is 2.

Wait, but let me check for a between -1 and 2. For example, a = 1. Let's see if the function is surjective.

For a = 1, the function is:

f(x) = x² when x ≥ 1, and f(x) = x + 2 when x < 1.

So, for x < 1, it's a linear function with slope 1. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. As x approaches 1 from the left, f(x) approaches 1 + 2 = 3.

For x ≥ 1, it's a quadratic function opening upwards. At x = 1, f(1) = 1² = 1. As x increases beyond 1, f(x) increases to infinity.

So, the function goes from negative infinity up to 3 on the left side, and from 1 to infinity on the right side. Wait, so there's a gap between 1 and 3. So, for y-values between 1 and 3, there is no x such that f(x) = y. Therefore, the function is not surjective for a = 1.

Hmm, so a = 1 is not good. So, maybe only a = 2 and a = -1 are the points where the function is continuous and surjective. But wait, for a between -1 and 2, the function is not surjective because of the gap. For a > 2, it's also not surjective because of the gap. For a < -1, let's see.

Wait, let's take a = -2. Then, the function is:

f(x) = -2x² when x ≥ -2, and f(x) = -2x + 2*(-2) = -2x -4 when x < -2.

So, for x < -2, it's a linear function with slope -2. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches -2*(-2) -4 = 4 -4 = 0.

For x ≥ -2, it's a quadratic function opening downwards. At x = -2, f(-2) = -2*(-2)² = -8. As x increases beyond -2, f(x) decreases to negative infinity.

So, the function goes from positive infinity down to 0 on the left side, and from -8 down to negative infinity on the right side. So, there's a gap between 0 and -8. Wait, but 0 is greater than -8, so actually, the function covers y from negative infinity to 0 on the left side, and y from -8 to negative infinity on the right side. Wait, that doesn't make sense. Let me think again.

Wait, for x < -2, f(x) = -2x -4. As x approaches negative infinity, f(x) approaches positive infinity because -2x becomes positive and large. As x approaches -2 from the left, f(x) approaches 0. So, the left side covers y from 0 to positive infinity.

For x ≥ -2, f(x) = -2x². At x = -2, f(-2) = -8. As x increases, f(x) decreases because it's a downward opening parabola. So, as x approaches infinity, f(x) approaches negative infinity. So, the right side covers y from -8 to negative infinity.

Therefore, the function covers y from negative infinity to 0 on the left side, and y from -8 to negative infinity on the right side. Wait, that means the function doesn't cover y between -8 and 0. So, for y between -8 and 0, there's no x such that f(x) = y. Therefore, the function is not surjective for a = -2.

So, only when a = 2 and a = -1, the function is continuous and surjective. For other values of a, either the function is not continuous, or it has a gap, making it not surjective.

Therefore, the largest value of a is 2.

Wait, but let me confirm for a = 2. The function is continuous at x = 2, and the left side goes up to 8, and the right side starts at 8 and goes to infinity. So, for y < 8, the left side covers it, and for y ≥ 8, the right side covers it. So, yes, every horizontal line intersects the graph.

For a = -1, the function is continuous at x = -1, and the left side goes from positive infinity down to -1, and the right side goes from -1 down to negative infinity. So, every horizontal line intersects the graph.

But since we're looking for the largest a, 2 is larger than -1, so 2 is the answer.

I think that's it. So, the largest a is 2.

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle defined by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, I'll start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a circle.

First, I'll complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

For the \( x \)-terms:
\( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as \( (x - 5)^2 - 25 \).

For the \( y \)-terms:
\( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as \( (y + 3)^2 - 9 \).

Substituting these back into the original equation:
\( (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \).

Combining the constants:
\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \).

Rearranging gives the standard form:
\( (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \).

The radius of the circle is the square root of the right-hand side, so:
\( \sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \).

Squaring both sides:
\( 34 - c = 1 \).

Solving for \( c \):
\( c = 34 - 1 = 33 \).

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is 33.

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the values of λ between 0 and 4 such that there exists an x in [0,1] where f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. The function f is given by f(x) = λx(1 - x). Hmm, interesting. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, I know that f is a quadratic function, specifically a logistic map. It's a common example in chaos theory, but I don't know if that's relevant here. Anyway, the function maps [0,1] to [0,1] because λ is between 0 and 4. So, for each x in [0,1], f(x) is also in [0,1].

The problem is asking for λ values where there's some x such that f(x) isn't equal to x, but when you apply f again, you get back to x. In other words, x is a periodic point of period 2 for the function f. So, x is not a fixed point, but it's part of a 2-cycle.

To find such λ, I need to solve the equation f(f(x)) = x, but exclude the solutions where f(x) = x. So, first, let's write down the equation f(f(x)) = x.

Given f(x) = λx(1 - x), then f(f(x)) would be f(λx(1 - x)). Let's compute that:

f(f(x)) = λ * [λx(1 - x)] * [1 - λx(1 - x)].

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)).

We need this equal to x:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx(1 - x)) = x.

Let me write that equation out:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) = x.

Wait, let me expand the term inside the brackets:

1 - λx(1 - x) = 1 - λx + λx^2.

So, f(f(x)) = λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2).

Set this equal to x:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) = x.

Now, let's bring everything to one side:

λ^2 x(1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1] = 0.

So, the solutions are either x = 0 or the term in the brackets equals zero:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1 = 0.

But x = 0 is a fixed point because f(0) = 0. Similarly, x = 1 is also a fixed point because f(1) = 0, but wait, f(1) = λ*1*(1 - 1) = 0, so f(1) = 0, which is different from 1 unless λ = 0. Hmm, but if λ = 0, then f(x) = 0 for all x, so f(f(x)) = 0 as well. So, in that case, x = 0 is the only fixed point, but x = 1 would map to 0, so f(f(1)) = 0 ≠ 1. So, x = 1 is not a fixed point unless λ = 0, but even then, f(1) = 0, so it's not a fixed point.

Wait, maybe I should check fixed points first. Fixed points satisfy f(x) = x, so:

λx(1 - x) = x.

Bring everything to one side:

λx(1 - x) - x = 0.

Factor out x:

x [λ(1 - x) - 1] = 0.

So, x = 0 or λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0.

Solving λ(1 - x) - 1 = 0:

λ(1 - x) = 1

1 - x = 1/λ

x = 1 - 1/λ.

But x must be in [0,1], so 1 - 1/λ must be in [0,1]. Therefore, 1/λ must be in [0,1], so λ ≥ 1.

So, fixed points are x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/λ, but only when λ ≥ 1.

So, for λ < 1, the only fixed point is x = 0.

But in our problem, we need x such that f(x) ≠ x, but f(f(x)) = x. So, x is a periodic point of period 2, not a fixed point.

Therefore, we need to solve f(f(x)) = x, excluding the fixed points.

So, going back to the equation:

λ^2 (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2) - 1 = 0.

Let me expand this expression:

First, expand (1 - x)(1 - λx + λx^2):

Multiply term by term:

1*(1 - λx + λx^2) = 1 - λx + λx^2

(-x)*(1 - λx + λx^2) = -x + λx^2 - λx^3

So, adding them together:

1 - λx + λx^2 - x + λx^2 - λx^3

Combine like terms:

1 - (λ + 1)x + (λ + λ)x^2 - λx^3

Simplify:

1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3

So, the equation becomes:

λ^2 [1 - (λ + 1)x + 2λx^2 - λx^3] - 1 = 0

Multiply through by λ^2:

λ^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + 2λ^3 x^2 - λ^3 x^3 - 1 = 0

So, rearranged:

-λ^3 x^3 + 2λ^3 x^2 - λ^2(λ + 1)x + (λ^2 - 1) = 0

Multiply both sides by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0

So, the equation is:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x - (λ^2 - 1) = 0

This is a cubic equation in x. Let's denote this as:

A x^3 + B x^2 + C x + D = 0

Where:

A = λ^3

B = -2λ^3

C = λ^2(λ + 1)

D = -(λ^2 - 1) = 1 - λ^2

So, the equation is:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2) = 0

We can factor this equation. Let me see if x = 1 is a root:

Plug x = 1:

λ^3(1) - 2λ^3(1) + λ^2(λ + 1)(1) + (1 - λ^2) =

λ^3 - 2λ^3 + λ^3 + λ^2 + 1 - λ^2 =

(λ^3 - 2λ^3 + λ^3) + (λ^2 - λ^2) + 1 =

0 + 0 + 1 = 1 ≠ 0

So, x = 1 is not a root.

What about x = 0? Plugging x = 0:

0 - 0 + 0 + (1 - λ^2) = 1 - λ^2

Which is zero only if λ = ±1, but λ is between 0 and 4, so λ = 1.

So, when λ = 1, x = 0 is a root. But x = 0 is a fixed point, so we need to exclude it.

Alternatively, maybe we can factor this cubic equation.

Let me try to factor it. Let's see if (x - a) is a factor.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor by grouping.

Looking at the equation:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2) = 0

Let me group terms:

(λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2) + (λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2)) = 0

Factor out λ^3 x^2 from the first group:

λ^3 x^2(x - 2) + [λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2)] = 0

Hmm, not sure if that helps. Maybe another grouping.

Alternatively, let's try to factor the cubic as (x^2 + a x + b)(c x + d). Let me attempt to factor it.

Assume:

(λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2)) = (x^2 + a x + b)(c x + d)

Multiply out the right side:

c x^3 + (a c + d) x^2 + (b c + a d) x + b d

Set equal to the left side:

c x^3 + (a c + d) x^2 + (b c + a d) x + b d = λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2)

So, equate coefficients:

1. c = λ^3

2. a c + d = -2λ^3

3. b c + a d = λ^2(λ + 1)

4. b d = 1 - λ^2

From equation 1: c = λ^3

From equation 4: b d = 1 - λ^2

Let me express d from equation 2:

From equation 2: a c + d = -2λ^3

But c = λ^3, so:

a λ^3 + d = -2λ^3

Thus, d = -2λ^3 - a λ^3 = -λ^3(2 + a)

From equation 4: b d = 1 - λ^2

Substitute d:

b (-λ^3(2 + a)) = 1 - λ^2

So, b = (1 - λ^2)/(-λ^3(2 + a)) = (λ^2 - 1)/(λ^3(2 + a))

From equation 3: b c + a d = λ^2(λ + 1)

Substitute b and d:

[(λ^2 - 1)/(λ^3(2 + a))] * λ^3 + a * (-λ^3(2 + a)) = λ^2(λ + 1)

Simplify:

(λ^2 - 1)/(2 + a) - a λ^3(2 + a) = λ^2(λ + 1)

Multiply both sides by (2 + a) to eliminate the denominator:

(λ^2 - 1) - a λ^3(2 + a)^2 = λ^2(λ + 1)(2 + a)

This seems complicated. Maybe this approach isn't the best. Perhaps instead, let's consider that the cubic equation can be factored as (x - fixed point)(quadratic). Since we know that x = 0 is a fixed point when λ = 1, but in general, fixed points are x = 0 and x = 1 - 1/λ.

Wait, maybe we can factor out (x - fixed point). Let's see.

We have the equation f(f(x)) = x, which includes fixed points as solutions. So, the equation f(f(x)) - x = 0 will have fixed points as roots, and the other roots are the period-2 points.

So, perhaps we can factor out (x - 0) and (x - (1 - 1/λ)) from the cubic equation.

But let's see. The cubic equation is:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2) = 0

If we factor out x, we get:

x (λ^3 x^2 - 2λ^3 x + λ^2(λ + 1)) + (1 - λ^2) = 0

But that doesn't seem helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps we can factor out (x - (1 - 1/λ)).

Let me denote α = 1 - 1/λ, which is the non-zero fixed point when λ ≥ 1.

So, let's check if (x - α) is a factor.

Compute f(f(α)) - α:

But since α is a fixed point, f(α) = α, so f(f(α)) = f(α) = α. So, f(f(α)) - α = 0, which means α is a root.

Similarly, x = 0 is a root when λ = 1, but not necessarily otherwise.

Wait, when λ ≠ 1, x = 0 is a fixed point, but f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0, so x = 0 is always a fixed point, hence a root of f(f(x)) - x.

So, the cubic equation f(f(x)) - x = 0 has roots at x = 0, x = α, and another root which is the period-2 point.

Therefore, the cubic can be factored as x (x - α) (something) = 0.

Let me try to perform polynomial division.

Divide the cubic equation by x (x - α).

But let's write the cubic as:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2) = 0

Let me write it as:

λ^3 x^3 - 2λ^3 x^2 + λ^2(λ + 1)x + (1 - λ^2) = 0

We can factor out x:

x (λ^3 x^2 - 2λ^3 x + λ^2(λ + 1)) + (1 -","[1, '1)) + (1 -']","(3,4]",[],False
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest positive angle θ in degrees such that tan θ equals this big fraction. The numerator is cos5° cos20° + cos35° cos50° - sin5° sin20° - sin35° sin50°, and the denominator is sin5° cos20° - sin35° cos50° + cos5° sin20° - cos35° sin50°. Hmm, that looks complicated, but maybe I can simplify it using some trigonometric identities.

First, let me look at the numerator. I see terms like cos A cos B and sin A sin B. I remember that cos(A + B) = cos A cos B - sin A sin B. So maybe I can group some terms together. Let me try:

Numerator: cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20° + cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50°

So, that's [cos5° cos20° - sin5° sin20°] + [cos35° cos50° - sin35° sin50°]

Using the identity, each bracket becomes cos(5° + 20°) and cos(35° + 50°). Let me compute those:

cos(25°) + cos(85°). So the numerator simplifies to cos25° + cos85°.

Now, the denominator: sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20° - sin35° cos50° - cos35° sin50°

Again, I see terms like sin A cos B + cos A sin B, which is sin(A + B). So let's group them:

[sin5° cos20° + cos5° sin20°] - [sin35° cos50° + cos35° sin50°]

Which becomes sin(25°) - sin(85°). So the denominator is sin25° - sin85°.

So now, tan θ = [cos25° + cos85°] / [sin25° - sin85°]

Hmm, maybe I can simplify this further. Let me recall some sum-to-product identities.

For the numerator: cos A + cos B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] cos[(A-B)/2]

So, cos25° + cos85° = 2 cos[(25+85)/2] cos[(25-85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) cos(-30°). Since cos is even, cos(-30°) = cos30°, so it's 2 cos55° cos30°.

Similarly, for the denominator: sin A - sin B = 2 cos[(A+B)/2] sin[(A-B)/2]

So, sin25° - sin85° = 2 cos[(25+85)/2] sin[(25-85)/2] = 2 cos(55°) sin(-30°). Since sin is odd, sin(-30°) = -sin30°, so it's 2 cos55° (-sin30°) = -2 cos55° sin30°.

So now, tan θ = [2 cos55° cos30°] / [-2 cos55° sin30°]

I can cancel out the 2 cos55° terms from numerator and denominator, as long as cos55° ≠ 0, which it isn't because 55° is not 90° or 270°, so that's fine.

So tan θ = [cos30°] / [-sin30°] = (cos30°)/(-sin30°) = -cot30°

Wait, because cos30° is positive, sin30° is positive, so it's negative of (cos30°/sin30°) which is -cot30°. But cot30° is 1/tan30°, which is √3. So tan θ = -√3.

Hmm, tan θ = -√3. So θ is an angle whose tangent is -√3. But we need the smallest positive angle θ. So, tangent is negative in the second and fourth quadrants. Since we're looking for the smallest positive angle, it should be in the fourth quadrant, but wait, angles are typically measured from 0° to 360°, so the smallest positive angle with tan θ = -√3 would be 360° - 60° = 300°, but that's not the smallest positive angle. Wait, no, actually, the reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°, but that's larger than 180°, so maybe I should think differently.

Wait, but tan θ = -√3. The principal value for arctangent of -√3 is -60°, but since we need a positive angle, we can add 180° to get it into the second quadrant, which would be 120°, because tan(120°) = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3. So θ = 120°, which is in the second quadrant.

But wait, is 120° the smallest positive angle? Because 120° is less than 180°, so yes, it's the smallest positive angle where tan θ = -√3. Alternatively, if we consider the period of tangent is 180°, so the general solution is θ = 120° + k*180°, where k is integer. So the smallest positive angle is 120°, right?

Wait, but let me double-check my steps because sometimes when simplifying, I might have made a mistake.

Starting from the numerator: cos25° + cos85°. Let me compute that numerically to check.

cos25° ≈ 0.9063, cos85° ≈ 0.0872, so sum ≈ 0.9935.

Denominator: sin25° - sin85°. sin25° ≈ 0.4226, sin85° ≈ 0.9962, so difference ≈ 0.4226 - 0.9962 ≈ -0.5736.

So tan θ ≈ 0.9935 / (-0.5736) ≈ -1.732, which is approximately -√3, since √3 ≈ 1.732. So that checks out.

So tan θ = -√3, so θ is 120°, because tan120° = tan(180° - 60°) = -tan60° = -√3.

Wait, but let me think again. The problem says ""najmanjšega pozitivnega kota θ"", which is the smallest positive angle. So 120° is the smallest positive angle where tan θ = -√3, because if I go below 120°, say 60°, tan60° is √3, positive. So the next angle where tan is negative is 120°, which is in the second quadrant.

Alternatively, if I consider the angle in the fourth quadrant, it would be 300°, but that's larger than 120°, so 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the numerator and denominator simplification.

Numerator: cos25° + cos85°. Using sum-to-product, that's 2 cos55° cos30°, which is correct because (25+85)/2=55°, (25-85)/2=-30°, and cos(-30)=cos30.

Denominator: sin25° - sin85°. Using the identity, that's 2 cos55° sin(-30°), which is -2 cos55° sin30°, correct.

So tan θ = [2 cos55 cos30] / [-2 cos55 sin30] = [cos30]/[-sin30] = -cot30 = -√3, since cot30 = 1/tan30 = √3.

So yes, that's correct. So tan θ = -√3, so θ = 120°, as that's the smallest positive angle where tangent is -√3.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a smaller positive angle than 120° where tan θ = -√3? Because sometimes, depending on the quadrant, but in the range of 0° to 360°, the solutions for tan θ = -√3 are at 120° and 300°, so 120° is the smallest positive angle.

Alternatively, if I consider negative angles, like -60°, but since we need positive, 120° is the answer.

Wait, but let me check if I can get a smaller angle by adding 180°, but 120° is less than 180°, so adding 180° would make it larger. So yes, 120° is the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but let me think again about the numerator and denominator. Did I compute them correctly?

Numerator: cos25 + cos85. Let me compute cos25 ≈ 0.9063, cos85 ≈ 0.0872, sum ≈ 0.9935.

Denominator: sin25 - sin85 ≈ 0.4226 - 0.9962 ≈ -0.5736.

So tan θ ≈ 0.9935 / (-0.5736) ≈ -1.732, which is -√3, correct.

So yes, θ = 120°, because tan120° = -√3.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way that θ could be smaller than 120°? For example, if the angle was in the fourth quadrant, but 300° is larger than 120°, so 120° is indeed the smallest positive angle.

Alternatively, if I consider that tan θ = -√3, the general solution is θ = 120° + k*180°, where k is integer. So the smallest positive angle is 120°, as 120° - 180° = -60°, which is negative, so 120° is the smallest positive.

Wait, but let me think again. Maybe I made a mistake in the sign somewhere. Let me go back to the denominator.

Denominator: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 - sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50.

Wait, I grouped them as [sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20] - [sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50], which is sin(25) - sin(85). But let me compute sin(25) ≈ 0.4226, sin(85) ≈ 0.9962, so sin25 - sin85 ≈ -0.5736, which is correct.

So denominator is negative, numerator is positive, so tan θ is negative, which is correct.

So yes, θ is in the second quadrant, 120°, which is the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way that θ could be smaller? For example, if I consider that tan θ = -√3, then θ could be 120°, but also 300°, but 120° is smaller. So yes, 120° is the answer.

Wait, but let me check if I can express θ in another way. For example, using reference angles. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360° - 60° = 300°, so yes, 120° is the smallest positive angle.

So, after all that, I think θ is 120°, so the answer is 120 degrees.

Wait, but let me just make sure I didn't make any mistake in the initial simplification.

Numerator: cos5 cos20 + cos35 cos50 - sin5 sin20 - sin35 sin50.

I grouped as (cos5 cos20 - sin5 sin20) + (cos35 cos50 - sin35 sin50) = cos(25) + cos(85). Correct.

Denominator: sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20 - sin35 cos50 - cos35 sin50.

Grouped as (sin5 cos20 + cos5 sin20) - (sin35 cos50 + cos35 sin50) = sin25 - sin85. Correct.

So, yes, that's correct.

So, tan θ = (cos25 + cos85)/(sin25 - sin85) = [2 cos55 cos30]/[-2 cos55 sin30] = -cot30 = -√3.

So θ = 120°, which is the smallest positive angle.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there a way that θ could be smaller? For example, if I consider that tan θ = -√3, then θ could be 120°, but also 300°, but 120° is smaller. So yes, 120° is the answer.

Wait, but let me check if I can express θ in another way. For example, using reference angles. The reference angle for tan θ = √3 is 60°, so in the second quadrant, it's 180° - 60° = 120°, and in the fourth quadrant, it's 360°","[120, '120']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where both \( x \) and \( y \) are between -1 and 1. Hmm, interesting. I remember that to find maxima or minima of functions with multiple variables, I can use calculus, specifically finding partial derivatives and setting them equal to zero. But before jumping into calculus, maybe I should see if there's a simpler way or some symmetry in the function.

Looking at the function, it's symmetric in a way. If I swap \( x \) and \( y \), the function remains the same. So maybe the maximum occurs when \( x = y \)? Let me test that idea. If \( x = y \), then the function becomes \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). So now I have a single-variable function: \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). I can find its maximum by taking the derivative.

Let me compute \( g'(x) \). Using the product rule: \( g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2}} \). Wait, let me double-check that. The derivative of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is \( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \). So, \( g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \left( \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) \). Simplifying that, it's \( 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \).

To combine these terms, I can write them over a common denominator: \( \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 2x^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \). Setting this equal to zero for critical points: \( 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \) which gives \( 4x^2 = 2 \) so \( x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( x = \pm \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Since we're looking for the maximum, and \( x \) is positive in the first quadrant, let's take \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Plugging this back into \( g(x) \), we get \( 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} \). Simplifying inside the square root: \( 1 - \frac{2}{4} = 1 - \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \). So, \( \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, \( g(x) = 2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{2}{4} = 1 \). So, when \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), the function \( f(x, y) \) equals 1.

But wait, is this the maximum? Maybe I should check other possibilities. What if \( x \) and \( y \) aren't equal? Let me consider using partial derivatives to find critical points.

So, let's compute the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \). Starting with \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} \):

The function is \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The derivative with respect to \( x \) is \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \). So, \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \).

Similarly, the partial derivative with respect to \( y \) is \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \).

To find critical points, set both partial derivatives equal to zero:

1. \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \)
2. \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \)

Let me denote equation 1 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)  ...(1)

And equation 2 as:

\( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)  ...(2)

Hmm, interesting. If I multiply equation (1) and equation (2) together, I get:

\( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \cdot \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \)

Simplifying the right side: \( \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}} \)

So, left side is \( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} \), right side is \( \frac{x^2 y^2}{\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)}} \)

Multiply both sides by \( \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} \):

\( (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

Expanding the left side: \( 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \)

Subtract \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides: \( 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \)

So, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). That's the equation of a circle with radius 1. So, the critical points lie on the unit circle.

Now, going back to equation (1): \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \)

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square roots:

\( 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \)

Multiply both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \):

\( (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

But wait, we already know from earlier that \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), so \( 1 - x^2 = y^2 \) and \( 1 - y^2 = x^2 \). Let me substitute these into the equation:

Left side: \( (x^2)(y^2) = x^2 y^2 \)

Right side: \( x^2 y^2 \)

So, both sides are equal, which is consistent. So, the equations are dependent, and we only have the condition \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

Therefore, the critical points lie on the unit circle. So, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) using trigonometric functions. Let me set \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \), since \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

Substituting into \( f(x, y) \):

\( f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \)

Simplify the square roots:

\( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \)

So, \( f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cdot \cos \theta + \sin \theta \cdot \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \)

Wait, that's interesting. So, on the unit circle, the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1. But earlier, when I assumed \( x = y \), I also got 1. So, does that mean that the maximum value is 1?

But hold on, let me check the boundaries. The domain is \( -1 \leq x, y \leq 1 \). So, the function is defined on the square with corners at (-1, -1), (-1, 1), (1, -1), and (1, 1). The maximum could also occur on the boundary of this square.

Let me check the boundaries. There are four edges to consider:

1. \( x = 1 \), \( -1 \leq y \leq 1 \)
2. \( x = -1 \), \( -1 \leq y \leq 1 \)
3. \( y = 1 \), \( -1 \leq x \leq 1 \)
4. \( y = -1 \), \( -1 \leq x \leq 1 \)

Let's evaluate \( f(x, y) \) on each edge.

1. For \( x = 1 \): \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum of this is 1 when \( y = 0 \).

2. For \( x = -1 \): \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 \). The maximum here is 0 when \( y = \pm 1 \), but actually, it's negative, so the maximum is 0.

3. For \( y = 1 \): \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum is 1 when \( x = 0 \).

4. For \( y = -1 \): \( f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum here is 0 when \( x = \pm 1 \).

So, on the boundaries, the maximum value is 1, achieved at (1, 0) and (0, 1). But earlier, on the unit circle, the function is always 1. So, does that mean that the maximum is 1?

Wait, but when I considered \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), which is on the unit circle, the function is 1. So, actually, the function reaches 1 both on the unit circle and on the boundaries. So, the maximum value is 1.

But hold on, let me check another point. What if \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \)? Then, \( f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0 \). So, that's not a maximum. Similarly, other corners give 0.

Wait, but what about points inside the square but not on the unit circle? For example, take \( x = 0.5 \), \( y = 0.5 \). Then, \( f(0.5, 0.5) = 0.5 \sqrt{1 - 0.25} + 0.5 \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} + 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{0.75} \approx 0.866 \), which is less than 1. So, it seems that 1 is indeed the maximum.

But just to be thorough, let me consider another approach. Maybe using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality or some trigonometric substitution.

Wait, another idea: since the function is symmetric, maybe I can set \( x = \sin \alpha \) and \( y = \sin \beta \), but I'm not sure if that helps. Alternatively, maybe use substitution variables.

Alternatively, think of \( f(x, y) \) as a sum of two terms, each involving a product of a variable and the square root of 1 minus the square of the other variable. It reminds me of the sine and cosine addition formulas.

Wait, if I set \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), then \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \cos \phi \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \cos \theta \). So, the function becomes \( \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi) \). So, \( f(x, y) = \sin(\theta + \phi) \). The maximum of sine is 1, so the maximum of \( f(x, y) \) is 1.

Wait, that's a neat substitution! So, if I let \( x = \sin \theta \) and \( y = \sin \phi \), then \( f(x, y) = \sin(\theta + \phi) \). Since the sine function has a maximum of 1, the maximum value of \(","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the area of triangle OAB. The points O, A, and B are given with their position vectors. Specifically, vector OA is (1, 2, 3) and vector OB is (-3, -2, 1). Hmm, I remember that to find the area of a triangle in 3D space, one way is to use the cross product of two sides. Let me think about how that works.

First, I know that the area of a triangle formed by two vectors can be found by half the magnitude of their cross product. So, if I can find vectors OA and OB, then compute their cross product, and then take half its magnitude, that should give me the area of triangle OAB. That makes sense because the cross product gives a vector perpendicular to both OA and OB, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by OA and OB. So, half of that would be the area of the triangle.

Alright, so let me write down the vectors:

Vector OA = (1, 2, 3)
Vector OB = (-3, -2, 1)

I need to compute the cross product of OA and OB. The cross product formula for two vectors a = (a1, a2, a3) and b = (b1, b2, b3) is given by:

a × b = (a2b3 - a3b2, a3b1 - a1b3, a1b2 - a2b1)

Let me apply this formula to OA and OB.

First component: (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8
Second component: (3)(-3) - (1)(1) = -9 - 1 = -10
Third component: (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4

So, the cross product OA × OB is (8, -10, 4). Now, I need to find the magnitude of this vector.

The magnitude of a vector (x, y, z) is sqrt(x² + y² + z²). So, let's compute that.

First, square each component:

8² = 64
(-10)² = 100
4² = 16

Add them up: 64 + 100 + 16 = 180

So, the magnitude is sqrt(180). Hmm, sqrt(180) can be simplified. Let me see, 180 is 36*5, so sqrt(36*5) = 6*sqrt(5). Therefore, the magnitude of the cross product is 6√5.

Since the area of the triangle is half of this, I need to divide by 2. So, the area is (6√5)/2 = 3√5.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake. It's easy to mix up signs or components when computing cross products.

First component: OA's y-component times OB's z-component minus OA's z-component times OB's y-component. So, 2*1 - 3*(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8. That seems right.

Second component: OA's z-component times OB's x-component minus OA's x-component times OB's z-component. So, 3*(-3) - 1*1 = -9 -1 = -10. Correct.

Third component: OA's x-component times OB's y-component minus OA's y-component times OB's x-component. So, 1*(-2) - 2*(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4. That's correct too.

Magnitude squared: 8² + (-10)² + 4² = 64 + 100 + 16 = 180. Yep, that's right. So sqrt(180) is indeed 6√5.

Therefore, the area is half of that, which is 3√5. So, I think that's the answer.

Just to recap, the steps were:

1. Identify vectors OA and OB.
2. Compute their cross product.
3. Find the magnitude of the cross product.
4. Divide by 2 to get the area of the triangle.

Everything seems to check out. I don't think I made any calculation errors. So, I'm confident that the area is 3√5.

**Final Answer**
The area of triangle \( OAB \) is \boxed{3\sqrt{5}}.
</think>

To find the area of triangle \( OAB \) with given vectors \( \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \) and \( \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \), we use the cross product method.

First, compute the cross product \( \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \):

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} (2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) \\ (3 \cdot (-3) - 1 \cdot 1) \\ (1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, find the magnitude of this cross product:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \( OAB \) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( OAB \) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem where z is a complex number, and it's given that z + 1/z equals (1 + sqrt(5))/2. I need to find z^85 + 1/z^85. Hmm, that seems a bit tricky, but maybe I can figure it out step by step.

First, let me write down what's given:

z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.

I remember that expressions like z + 1/z often relate to roots of unity or maybe some trigonometric identities. Maybe I can express z in terms of exponential form or something. Let me think.

Alternatively, I recall that if we have z + 1/z = 2 cos(theta), then z can be written as e^{i theta}. But in this case, the right-hand side is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which is actually the golden ratio, approximately 1.618. Wait, 2 cos(theta) can't be more than 2, right? Because cosine ranges between -1 and 1, so 2 cos(theta) is between -2 and 2. But (1 + sqrt(5))/2 is about 1.618, which is less than 2, so that's okay. So maybe I can set 2 cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which would mean cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4.

Let me compute that value: (1 + sqrt(5))/4 is approximately (1 + 2.236)/4 ≈ 3.236/4 ≈ 0.809. So cos(theta) ≈ 0.809. Hmm, that's a known value. Wait, cos(36 degrees) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4? Let me check: cos(36°) is indeed (1 + sqrt(5))/4 multiplied by 2, right? Wait, no, cos(36°) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2 = (sqrt(5) + 1)/2, which is actually the golden ratio. Wait, no, that's not right. Wait, cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, which is the golden ratio. Wait, but that's more than 1, which can't be because cosine can't exceed 1. Hmm, I must be confused.

Wait, let me double-check. The exact value of cos(36°) is (1 + sqrt(5))/4 * 2, which is (1 + sqrt(5))/2, but that's approximately 1.618, which is greater than 1, which is impossible for cosine. So that can't be right. Maybe I made a mistake.

Wait, actually, cos(36°) is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/2, but that's the golden ratio, which is about 1.618, which is more than 1, so that can't be. So maybe I'm thinking of a different angle.

Wait, perhaps it's 18 degrees? Let me check. Cos(18°) is sqrt((5 + sqrt(5))/8), which is approximately 0.951056. Hmm, that's not 0.809. Wait, 0.809 is actually cos(36°), right? Let me compute cos(36°):

cos(36°) ≈ 0.8090, yes, that's correct. So cos(36°) ≈ 0.8090, which is (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, let me compute (sqrt(5) + 1)/4:

sqrt(5) ≈ 2.236, so sqrt(5) + 1 ≈ 3.236, divided by 4 is ≈ 0.809. Yes, so cos(theta) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, no, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately 0.809, which is exactly cos(36°). So, cos(theta) = (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 * 2? Wait, no, (sqrt(5) + 1)/4 is approximately 0.809, which is cos(36°). So, if 2 cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, then cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4, which is approximately 0.809, which is cos(36°). So theta is 36°, or pi/5 radians.

So, if z + 1/z = 2 cos(theta), then z = e^{i theta} or z = e^{-i theta}. So, z can be e^{i pi/5} or e^{-i pi/5}.

Therefore, z^85 + 1/z^85 would be 2 cos(85 theta). Since theta is pi/5, 85 theta is 85 * pi/5 = 17 pi. So, 2 cos(17 pi). But cos(17 pi) is cos(pi) because cosine has a period of 2 pi, so 17 pi is equivalent to pi (since 17 is odd, 17 pi = 8*2 pi + pi). So cos(17 pi) = cos(pi) = -1. Therefore, 2 cos(17 pi) = -2.

Wait, but let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. Let me go through it again.

Given z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2. Let me denote this as 2 cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/2, so cos(theta) = (1 + sqrt(5))/4 ≈ 0.809, which is cos(36°) or pi/5 radians. So theta = pi/5.

Therefore, z = e^{i pi/5} or z = e^{-i pi/5}.

Now, z^n + 1/z^n = 2 cos(n theta). So, for n = 85, it's 2 cos(85 * pi/5). Let's compute 85 * pi/5: 85 divided by 5 is 17, so 17 pi.

Now, cos(17 pi) = cos(pi) because 17 is odd, so 17 pi = pi + 16 pi, and 16 pi is 8 full circles, so cos(17 pi) = cos(pi) = -1. Therefore, 2 cos(17 pi) = -2.

So, z^85 + 1/z^85 = -2.

Wait, but let me check if I can do this another way, maybe using recurrence relations or something, just to confirm.

Another approach: Let me denote a_n = z^n + 1/z^n. Then, we have a recurrence relation: a_{n+1} = (z + 1/z) * a_n - a_{n-1}.

Given that a_0 = z^0 + 1/z^0 = 2.

a_1 = z + 1/z = (1 + sqrt(5))/2.

Then, a_2 = (z + 1/z) * a_1 - a_0 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 - 2.

Wait, let me compute that:

[(1 + sqrt(5))/2]^2 = (1 + 2 sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 + 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2.

So, a_2 = (3 + sqrt(5))/2 - 2 = (3 + sqrt(5) - 4)/2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2.

Similarly, a_3 = (z + 1/z) * a_2 - a_1 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] - [(1 + sqrt(5))/2].

Let me compute that:

First, multiply [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] = [ (1)(-1) + 1*sqrt(5) + (-1)*sqrt(5) + (sqrt(5))^2 ] / 4 = [ -1 + sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) + 5 ] / 4 = (4)/4 = 1.

So, a_3 = 1 - [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] = (2 - 1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Similarly, a_4 = (z + 1/z) * a_3 - a_2 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(1 - sqrt(5))/2] - [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2].

Compute the first term: [(1 + sqrt(5))(1 - sqrt(5))]/4 = (1 - 5)/4 = (-4)/4 = -1.

So, a_4 = -1 - [(-1 + sqrt(5))/2] = -1 + (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-2 + 1 - sqrt(5))/2 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2.

a_5 = (z + 1/z) * a_4 - a_3 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] - [(1 - sqrt(5))/2].

Compute the first term: [(1)(-1) + 1*(-sqrt(5)) + (-1)*sqrt(5) + (sqrt(5))*(-sqrt(5))]/4 = [ -1 - sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) - 5 ] /4 = (-6 - 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2.

So, a_5 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2 - (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = [(-3 - sqrt(5)) -1 + sqrt(5)]/2 = (-4)/2 = -2.

Wait, a_5 is -2. Interesting. Let's see a_6:

a_6 = (z + 1/z) * a_5 - a_4 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * (-2) - [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2].

Compute: [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * (-2) = -(1 + sqrt(5)).

Then, subtract [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2]: so -(1 + sqrt(5)) - [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] = -(1 + sqrt(5)) + (1 + sqrt(5))/2 = (-2(1 + sqrt(5)) + (1 + sqrt(5)))/2 = (- (1 + sqrt(5)))/2.

So, a_6 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2.

Wait, that's the same as a_4. Hmm, so let's see:

a_0 = 2

a_1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_3 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_4 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_5 = -2

a_6 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_7 = ?

Wait, let's compute a_7:

a_7 = (z + 1/z) * a_6 - a_5 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] - (-2).

Compute the first term: [(1)(-1) + 1*(-sqrt(5)) + (-1)*sqrt(5) + (sqrt(5))*(-sqrt(5))]/4 = (-1 - sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) -5)/4 = (-6 - 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2.

So, a_7 = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2 - (-2) = (-3 - sqrt(5))/2 + 2 = (-3 - sqrt(5) + 4)/2 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2, which is a_3.

Hmm, so a_7 = a_3.

Similarly, a_8 = (z + 1/z) * a_7 - a_6 = [(1 + sqrt(5))/2] * [(1 - sqrt(5))/2] - [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2].

Compute the first term: [(1)(1) + 1*(-sqrt(5)) + (-sqrt(5))(1) + (-sqrt(5))*(-sqrt(5))]/4 = (1 - sqrt(5) - sqrt(5) + 5)/4 = (6 - 2 sqrt(5))/4 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2.

So, a_8 = (3 - sqrt(5))/2 - [(-1 - sqrt(5))/2] = (3 - sqrt(5) +1 + sqrt(5))/2 = 4/2 = 2, which is a_0.

So, a_8 = a_0 = 2.

So, the sequence of a_n is periodic with period 5? Wait, let's see:

a_0 = 2

a_1 = (1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_2 = (-1 + sqrt(5))/2

a_3 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_4 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2

a_5 = -2

a_6 = (-1 - sqrt(5))/2 = a_4

a_7 = (1 - sqrt(5))/2 = a_3

a_8 = 2 = a_0

So, the period is 5, because a_5 = -2, a_6 = a_4, a_7 = a_3, a_8 = a_0, so the cycle repeats every 5 terms.

Wait, but from a_0 to a_5, it's 5 terms, and then a_5 is -2, which is different from a_0. So, the period is 5, but the sequence goes a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6=a_4, a_7=a_3, a_8=a_0, so the cycle is 5 terms, but starting from a_0, the sequence is 2, (1 + sqrt(5))/","[2, '2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here. Let me try to visualize it first. There's a triangle ABC, and the medians AD, BE, and CF intersect at the centroid G. A line passing through G and parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. The area of triangle ABC is 144, and I need to find the area of triangle ENG. Hmm, okay.

First, I remember that the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer part being closer to the vertex. So, for example, AG:GD = 2:1, BG:GE = 2:1, and CG:GF = 2:1. That might come in handy later.

Now, the line through G parallel to BC intersects AB at M and AC at N. Since it's parallel to BC, triangle AMN should be similar to triangle ABC by the Basic Proportionality Theorem, also known as Thales' theorem. That theorem states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally.

So, if MN is parallel to BC, then AM/AB = AN/AC. Let me denote the ratio of similarity as k. Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through the centroid G, I need to find the ratio k.

Wait, how does the centroid affect this ratio? The centroid divides each median into a 2:1 ratio, so maybe the distance from A to MN is 2/3 of the height from A to BC? Because the centroid is located 2/3 of the way along each median from the vertex.

If that's the case, then the height of triangle AMN would be 2/3 the height of triangle ABC. Since the area of a triangle is (base * height)/2, and if both the base and height are scaled by k, the area would be scaled by k².

But wait, in this case, MN is parallel to BC, so the ratio of similarity k is the ratio of the heights. If the height is 2/3, then k = 2/3. Therefore, the area of triangle AMN would be (2/3)² times the area of ABC, which is 144. So, (4/9)*144 = 64. So, area of AMN is 64.

But wait, the problem is asking for the area of triangle ENG, not AMN. Hmm, okay, so I need to figure out where points E, N, and G are located.

Let me recall that E is the midpoint of AC because BE is a median. Similarly, F is the midpoint of AB, and D is the midpoint of BC. So, E is the midpoint of AC, which means AE = EC.

Now, point N is the intersection of the line through G parallel to BC with AC. So, N is somewhere on AC. Similarly, M is on AB.

I need to find the coordinates or the ratios to figure out the area of triangle ENG. Maybe coordinate geometry would help here. Let me assign coordinates to the triangle ABC to make it easier.

Let's place point A at (0, 0), point B at (2b, 0), and point C at (2c, 2d). I choose these coordinates so that the midpoints will have integer coordinates, which might simplify calculations.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 0)
- B: (2b, 0)
- C: (2c, 2d)

Midpoints:
- D is the midpoint of BC: ((2b + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (b + c, d)
- E is the midpoint of AC: ((0 + 2c)/2, (0 + 2d)/2) = (c, d)
- F is the midpoint of AB: ((0 + 2b)/2, (0 + 0)/2) = (b, 0)

Centroid G is the intersection of the medians. The centroid's coordinates are the average of the vertices' coordinates:
G_x = (0 + 2b + 2c)/3 = (2b + 2c)/3
G_y = (0 + 0 + 2d)/3 = (2d)/3

So, G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

Now, the line through G parallel to BC. Let's find the equation of BC first. Points B(2b, 0) and C(2c, 2d). The slope of BC is (2d - 0)/(2c - 2b) = (2d)/(2c - 2b) = d/(c - b).

So, the line through G with the same slope will have the equation:
(y - (2d)/3) = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

This line intersects AB and AC at M and N, respectively.

First, let's find point M on AB. AB is the line from A(0,0) to B(2b, 0), so it's the x-axis. Therefore, the y-coordinate of M is 0. Let's plug y=0 into the equation of the line through G:

0 - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify:
-2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Multiply both sides by (c - b)/d:
-2d/3 * (c - b)/d = x - (2b + 2c)/3
-2(c - b)/3 = x - (2b + 2c)/3

Bring the term on the right to the left:
x = (2b + 2c)/3 - 2(c - b)/3
x = [2b + 2c - 2c + 2b]/3
x = (4b)/3

So, point M is at (4b/3, 0).

Similarly, let's find point N on AC. AC is from A(0,0) to C(2c, 2d). The parametric equations for AC can be written as x = 2c*t, y = 2d*t, where t ranges from 0 to 1.

The line through G has equation:
y - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(x - (2b + 2c)/3)

Substitute x = 2c*t and y = 2d*t into this equation:

2d*t - (2d)/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - (2b + 2c)/3)

Simplify the left side:
2d*t - 2d/3 = (d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2b/3 - 2c/3)

Factor out 2/3 on the right side inside the parentheses:
= (d/(c - b))(2c*t - 2(b + c)/3)
= (d/(c - b))( (6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3 )
= (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

So, left side: 2d*t - 2d/3
Right side: (d/(c - b))*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)/3

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominators:
3*(2d*t - 2d/3) = d/(c - b)*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)
6d*t - 2d = d/(c - b)*(6c*t - 2b - 2c)

Divide both sides by d (assuming d ≠ 0):
6t - 2 = (6c*t - 2b - 2c)/(c - b)

Multiply both sides by (c - b):
(6t - 2)(c - b) = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Expand the left side:
6t*c - 6t*b - 2c + 2b = 6c*t - 2b - 2c

Bring all terms to the left:
6t*c - 6t*b - 2c + 2b - 6c*t + 2b + 2c = 0

Simplify:
(6t*c - 6c*t) + (-6t*b) + (-2c + 2c) + (2b + 2b) = 0
0 -6t*b + 0 + 4b = 0
-6t*b + 4b = 0

Factor out b:
b*(-6t + 4) = 0

Assuming b ≠ 0 (since AB has length 2b, which can't be zero), we have:
-6t + 4 = 0
-6t = -4
t = 2/3

So, t = 2/3. Therefore, point N is at (2c*(2/3), 2d*(2/3)) = (4c/3, 4d/3).

Wait, but AC goes from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), so t=2/3 gives N at (4c/3, 4d/3). That makes sense.

So, now we have coordinates for points M(4b/3, 0) and N(4c/3, 4d/3).

Now, let's recall the coordinates of E, which is the midpoint of AC: (c, d). And G is at ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

We need to find the area of triangle ENG. So, points E(c, d), N(4c/3, 4d/3), and G((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3).

To find the area of triangle ENG, we can use the shoelace formula.

First, let's list the coordinates:

E: (c, d)
N: (4c/3, 4d/3)
G: ((2b + 2c)/3, (2d)/3)

Let me write them as (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3):

x1 = c, y1 = d
x2 = 4c/3, y2 = 4d/3
x3 = (2b + 2c)/3, y3 = 2d/3

Shoelace formula:

Area = |(x1(y2 - y3) + x2(y3 - y1) + x3(y1 - y2))/2|

Plugging in the values:

= |(c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) + (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) + ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3))/2|

Simplify each term:

First term: c*(4d/3 - 2d/3) = c*(2d/3) = (2cd)/3

Second term: (4c/3)*(2d/3 - d) = (4c/3)*(-d/3) = (-4cd)/9

Third term: ((2b + 2c)/3)*(d - 4d/3) = ((2b + 2c)/3)*(-d/3) = (-2b d - 2c d)/9

So, putting it all together:

Area = |( (2cd)/3 + (-4cd)/9 + (-2bd - 2cd)/9 ) / 2 |

Combine the terms:

First, convert (2cd)/3 to ninths: (6cd)/9

So, 6cd/9 - 4cd/9 - 2bd/9 - 2cd/9

Combine like terms:

(6cd - 4cd - 2cd)/9 - 2bd/9 = (0cd)/9 - 2bd/9 = -2bd/9

So, absolute value:

| (-2bd/9 ) / 2 | = | (-2bd/9 ) * (1/2) | = | -bd/9 | = bd/9

So, the area of triangle ENG is bd/9.

But wait, what is bd in terms of the area of ABC?

The area of triangle ABC can be calculated using the coordinates as well. Using shoelace formula:

Coordinates of ABC: A(0,0), B(2b,0), C(2c,2d)

Area = |(0*(0 - 2d) + 2b*(2d - 0) + 2c*(0 - 0))/2|
= |0 + 4bd + 0| / 2
= |4bd| / 2
= 2bd

Given that the area of ABC is 144, so 2bd = 144 => bd = 72.

Therefore, the area of triangle ENG is bd/9 = 72/9 = 8.

So, the area is 8.

Wait, let me double-check my calculations because sometimes with coordinates, it's easy to make a mistake.

First, the area of ABC: yes, 2bd = 144, so bd = 72.

Then, the area of ENG was calculated as bd/9, which is 72/9 = 8. That seems correct.

Alternatively, maybe there's a ratio approach without coordinates.

Since MN is parallel to BC and passes through centroid G, which divides the medians in 2:1. So, the ratio of similarity between AMN and ABC is 2/3, as I thought earlier, so area is (2/3)^2 * 144 = 64.

But then, how does triangle ENG relate to this?

Point E is the midpoint of AC, so E divides AC into two equal parts. Point N is on AC, and from earlier, we found that AN = (4c/3, 4d/3), which is 2/3 of AC. Wait, AC is from (0,0) to (2c, 2d), so 2/3 of AC is indeed (4c/3, 4d/3). So, AN = 2/3 AC, meaning that N divides AC in a 2:1 ratio.

Similarly, point G is the centroid, so it's located 2/3 along the median from A to D.

So, in triangle AMN, which has area 64, point E is the midpoint of AC, but in triangle AMN, point N is 2/3 along AC. So, E is actually beyond N towards C.

"Okay, so I have this problem: For how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) does \( 2^{24} \) hold as a perfect \( n \)-th power? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I know that a number is a perfect \( n \)-th power if it can be expressed as some integer raised to the power of \( n \). In this case, the number is \( 2^{24} \). So, I need to find all integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

Let me recall that if a number \( a \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, then there exists some integer \( k \) such that \( a = k^n \). So, in this case, \( 2^{24} = k^n \). That means \( k \) must be a power of 2 as well because \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2. Let me write \( k \) as \( 2^m \), where \( m \) is a positive integer.

Substituting back, we have \( 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \). Using the laws of exponents, this simplifies to \( 2^{24} = 2^{m \cdot n} \). Since the bases are the same, the exponents must be equal. Therefore, \( m \cdot n = 24 \).

So, now the problem reduces to finding all positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( n \) divides 24. Because \( m \) must also be an integer, \( n \) has to be a divisor of 24.

Alright, so I need to find all the divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. Let me list the divisors of 24. To do that, I can factorize 24 into its prime factors. The prime factorization of 24 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \).

The number of divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying those results. So, for 24, the exponents are 3 and 1. Adding 1 to each gives 4 and 2. Multiplying them together, \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \), so there are 8 divisors in total.

Let me list all the divisors of 24:

1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

But the problem specifies \( n > 1 \), so we exclude 1. That leaves us with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. So, that's 7 divisors.

Wait, let me double-check. If \( n \) is a divisor of 24, then \( m = 24 / n \) must be an integer. So, for each \( n \) in the list above, \( m \) would be 12, 8, 6, 4, 3, 2, and 1 respectively. But since \( m \) must be a positive integer, all these are valid.

Therefore, each of these \( n \) values will satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power. For example, if \( n = 2 \), then \( k = 2^{12} \), and \( (2^{12})^2 = 2^{24} \). Similarly, for \( n = 3 \), \( k = 2^8 \), and \( (2^8)^3 = 2^{24} \). This pattern continues for all the divisors.

So, counting them up: 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. That's 7 numbers in total.

Wait, hold on, is there a possibility that I missed any divisors? Let me list them again:

Starting from 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. Yes, that's all. So excluding 1, we have 7 divisors.

Therefore, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is 7.

**Final Answer**
The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by noting that \( 2^{24} \) must be expressible as \( k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies \( k \) must be a power of 2, say \( k = 2^m \). Thus, we have:

\[ 2^{24} = (2^m)^n \]

Using the laws of exponents, this simplifies to:

\[ 2^{24} = 2^{m \cdot n} \]

Equating the exponents, we get:

\[ m \cdot n = 24 \]

We need to find all positive integers \( n > 1 \) that divide 24. The prime factorization of 24 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \), which has divisors:

\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Excluding 1, the valid divisors are:

\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Thus, there are 7 such integers \( n \).

The number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the product of sines at various angles: sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°, sin100°, sin120°, sin140°, and sin160°. That's eight sine terms multiplied together. Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe there's a pattern or a formula that can help simplify this.

First, I remember that sometimes products of sines can be simplified using product-to-sum identities or other trigonometric identities. But with eight terms, that might get messy. Alternatively, I recall that products of sines at equally spaced angles can sometimes be expressed in terms of multiple angles or using complex numbers. Let me think about that.

Looking at the angles: 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. These angles are all multiples of 20°, right? So, 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. That's 20° times 1 through 8. So, 20°, 40°, ..., up to 160°. So, it's like 20° times k, where k is from 1 to 8.

Wait, but 160° is 8 times 20°, which is 160°, and 100° is 5 times 20°, so yeah, all these angles are multiples of 20°. So, maybe I can express this product as the product of sin(20°k) for k from 1 to 8.

But I also notice that some of these angles are greater than 90°, like 100°, 120°, 140°, 160°. I remember that sin(180° - x) = sinx, so maybe I can rewrite those terms in terms of their supplementary angles.

Let me try that. So, sin100° is sin(80°), sin120° is sin(60°), sin140° is sin(40°), and sin160° is sin(20°). So, substituting these, the original product becomes:

sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin80° * sin60° * sin40° * sin20°.

Wait, so that's [sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°]^2. Because each of the higher angles (100°, 120°, 140°, 160°) corresponds to the lower ones (80°, 60°, 40°, 20°), so when I substitute, I get the same terms again. So, the product is the square of the product of sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°.

So, now the problem reduces to finding [sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°]^2.

Hmm, okay, so maybe I can compute the product sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° first, and then square it.

I remember that there's a formula for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Let me recall that. The formula is something like the product of sin(kπ/(2n)) for k from 1 to n-1 is equal to n/(2^{n-1}). But wait, that's for angles in radians and specific cases. Let me check if that applies here.

Wait, in our case, the angles are 20°, 40°, 60°, 80°, which are 20° apart. So, 20° is π/9 radians, 40° is 2π/9, 60° is π/3, 80° is 4π/9. So, in radians, the angles are π/9, 2π/9, 3π/9, 4π/9. So, that's kπ/9 for k=1,2,3,4.

So, the product sin(π/9) * sin(2π/9) * sin(3π/9) * sin(4π/9). Hmm, so that's the product of sin(kπ/9) for k=1 to 4.

I think there's a formula for the product of sines of the form sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to m, where m is less than n/2. Let me recall.

I remember that the product of sin(kπ/n) for k=1 to n-1 is n/(2^{n-1}). But in our case, n=9, and we're only taking k=1 to 4, which is less than n/2 (since 9/2 is 4.5). So, maybe there's a similar formula for the product up to m where m < n/2.

Alternatively, I can use the identity that the product of sin(kπ/(2m+1)) for k=1 to m is sqrt{(2m+1)}/(2^m). Wait, let me check that.

Wait, actually, I think the formula is that the product of sin(kπ/(2m+1)) for k=1 to m is sqrt{(2m+1)}/(2^m). So, in our case, if n=9, which is 2m+1, so m=4. So, the product of sin(kπ/9) for k=1 to 4 is sqrt{9}/(2^4) = 3/16.

Wait, is that correct? Let me verify.

Wait, I think the formula is that the product from k=1 to m of sin(kπ/(2m+1)) equals sqrt{(2m+1)}/(2^m). So, for m=4, 2m+1=9, so the product is sqrt{9}/(2^4) = 3/16. So, that would mean sin(π/9) * sin(2π/9) * sin(3π/9) * sin(4π/9) = 3/16.

But wait, 3π/9 is π/3, which is 60°, so that's sin60°, which is sqrt{3}/2. So, let's compute the product:

sin(π/9) * sin(2π/9) * sin(π/3) * sin(4π/9) = 3/16.

But wait, let me compute the product numerically to check.

Compute sin20°, sin40°, sin60°, sin80°:

sin20° ≈ 0.3420

sin40° ≈ 0.6428

sin60° ≈ 0.8660

sin80° ≈ 0.9848

Multiplying them together: 0.3420 * 0.6428 ≈ 0.220, then 0.220 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.190, then 0.190 * 0.9848 ≈ 0.187.

So, the product is approximately 0.187. Now, 3/16 is 0.1875, which is very close. So, that seems correct. So, the product sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° is 3/16.

Therefore, the original product is [3/16]^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me make sure. Because the formula I used was for the product of sin(kπ/(2m+1)) for k=1 to m, which in this case is m=4, so 2m+1=9, so the product is sqrt{9}/(2^4) = 3/16. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the product sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° is 3/16, so squaring that gives 9/256.

But wait, let me think again. The original product was sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° * sin100° * sin120° * sin140° * sin160°, which we converted to [sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80°]^2, which is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

But wait, let me check if that's correct. Because when I substituted sin100° as sin80°, sin120° as sin60°, etc., I ended up with the same terms, so the product becomes the square of the original four terms. So, yes, that seems correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that the product of sinθ and sin(180° - θ) is sin^2θ, but in this case, since we have multiple such pairs, it's the square of the product of the first four terms.

So, if the product of the first four terms is 3/16, then the entire product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

But let me double-check the formula. I think the formula for the product of sines of equally spaced angles is indeed given by that. Let me see.

The formula is: For n an odd integer, the product from k=1 to (n-1)/2 of sin(kπ/n) = sqrt{n}/(2^{(n-1)/2}).

Wait, in our case, n=9, so (n-1)/2=4, so the product from k=1 to 4 of sin(kπ/9) = sqrt{9}/(2^4) = 3/16. So, that's correct.

Therefore, the product sin20° * sin40° * sin60° * sin80° is indeed 3/16, so the original product is (3/16)^2 = 9/256.

Wait, but let me compute 9/256 numerically to see if it's approximately 0.03515625. Earlier, when I computed the product of the first four terms, I got approximately 0.187, and squaring that gives approximately 0.035, which matches 9/256. So, that seems consistent.

Therefore, the final answer should be 9/256.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem, maybe using complex numbers or roots of unity.

I remember that the product of sines can sometimes be related to the roots of certain polynomials. For example, the roots of the equation sin(9θ) = 0 are θ = kπ/9 for k=0,1,...,8. So, maybe we can express sin(9θ) in terms of sinθ and then find the product of the roots.

Wait, sin(9θ) can be expressed as a polynomial in sinθ. Let me recall that sin(nθ) can be written as a sum involving powers of sinθ. Specifically, sin(9θ) can be written as a polynomial of degree 9 in sinθ, but that might be complicated.

Alternatively, using the identity that sin(9θ) = 0 when θ = kπ/9, so the roots are θ = 0, π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9. So, the non-zero roots are θ = π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9.

But since sin(9θ) is an odd function, we can write it as 9θ - (9θ)^3/6 + ... but that might not be helpful.

Alternatively, using the identity that sin(9θ) = 9 sinθ - 120 sin^3θ + 432 sin^5θ - 576 sin^7θ + 256 sin^9θ. Hmm, that seems complicated, but maybe we can factor it.

Wait, sin(9θ) can be factored as 9 sinθ product_{k=1 to 4} (1 - (sinθ)^2 / sin^2(kπ/9)). Wait, I'm not sure about that.

Alternatively, using the identity that sin(nθ) = 2^{n-1} product_{k=1 to n} sin(θ + (k-1)π/n). Hmm, not sure.

Wait, maybe it's better to think in terms of the roots of the equation sin(9θ) = 0. The roots are θ = kπ/9 for k=0,1,...,8. So, excluding θ=0, the roots are θ = π/9, 2π/9, ..., 8π/9.

So, sin(9θ) can be written as 9θ product_{k=1 to 4} (1 - (θ^2)/( (kπ/9)^2 )) but I'm not sure.

Wait, actually, I think the product formula for sine is sin(πz) = πz product_{n=1 to ∞} (1 - z^2/n^2). But that's for infinite products.

Alternatively, for finite products, maybe we can express sin(9θ) in terms of sinθ and the product of sines of the other roots.

Wait, perhaps using the identity that sin(9θ) = 9 sinθ - 120 sin^3θ + 432 sin^5θ - 576 sin^7θ + 256 sin^9θ, as I thought earlier.

But if we set sin(9θ) = 0, then 9 sinθ - 120 sin^3θ + 432 sin^5θ - 576 sin^7θ + 256 sin^9θ = 0.

Dividing both sides by sinθ (since sinθ ≠ 0 for θ ≠ 0), we get 9 - 120 sin^2θ + 432 sin^4θ - 576 sin^6θ + 256","[9/256.0, '9/256.\n']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to figure out the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates. The options are a line, circle, plane, sphere, cylinder, or cone. Hmm, let me think about this step by step.

First, I remember that cylindrical coordinates are represented as \( (r, \theta, z) \). In this system, \( r \) is the radial distance from the z-axis, \( \theta \) is the angle made with the positive x-axis, and \( z \) is the height above the xy-plane. So, each point is defined by these three components.

The equation given is \( z = c \). That means, for any point in space, the z-coordinate is fixed at the constant value \( c \). I need to visualize what this looks like. If I fix the z-coordinate, what does that represent geometrically?

In Cartesian coordinates, if I have \( z = c \), that's a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \). But wait, in cylindrical coordinates, does this change anything? I don't think so because the z-coordinate is the same in both systems. So, regardless of \( r \) and \( \theta \), as long as \( z \) is fixed, the shape should still be a plane.

Let me double-check. In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary freely, right? So, if \( z \) is fixed, \( r \) can be any value from 0 to infinity, and \( \theta \) can go all the way around from 0 to \( 2\pi \). That means the set of all points where \( z = c \) would cover an entire plane extending infinitely in the radial direction and around the entire angle. So, yes, that's a plane.

Wait, but let me make sure I'm not confusing this with something else. For example, if the equation was \( r = c \), that would be a cylinder with radius \( c \) extending along the z-axis. Similarly, if it was \( \theta = c \), that would be a vertical plane at a fixed angle. But in this case, it's \( z = c \), which is different.

So, in Cartesian terms, \( z = c \) is a plane. Since cylindrical coordinates are just another way of representing the same space, the equation \( z = c \) should still represent a plane. Therefore, the correct answer should be a plane.

Let me also consider the other options to make sure I'm not missing something. A line would require two coordinates to be fixed, like \( r = c \) and \( \theta = c \), but here only \( z \) is fixed. A circle would require both \( r \) and \( z \) to be fixed, but \( \theta \) varies, but in this case, \( r \) can vary. A sphere would involve all three coordinates in a more complex way, like \( r^2 + z^2 = c^2 \). A cylinder is when \( r \) is fixed, and a cone is when \( r \) is proportional to \( z \). So none of these fit the equation \( z = c \).

Therefore, I'm confident that the shape described by \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates is a plane.
</think>

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates fixes the height \( z \) at a constant value \( c \), allowing \( r \) and \( \theta \) to vary freely. This describes a horizontal plane parallel to the xy-plane at height \( c \).

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the smallest possible angle between two vectors a and b. The given information is that the magnitude of vector a is 2, the magnitude of vector b is 7, and their cross product is (3, 2, 6). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that the cross product of two vectors a and b is given by the formula:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta) \mathbf{n}
\]

where θ is the angle between them and n is the unit vector perpendicular to both a and b. The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by a and b, which is also equal to \(\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)\).

So, if I can find the magnitude of the cross product, I can set it equal to \(\|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)\) and solve for sin(theta), then find theta.

Let me calculate the magnitude of the given cross product vector (3, 2, 6). The magnitude is found by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of its components:

\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Okay, so the magnitude of the cross product is 7. Now, plugging into the formula:

\[
7 = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)
\]

We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), so:

\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin(\theta)
\]

Simplify the right side:

\[
7 = 14 \sin(\theta)
\]

Divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

So, sin(theta) is 1/2. Now, I need to find the angle theta where sine is 1/2. I remember that sin(30°) = 1/2 and sin(150°) = 1/2. Since we're looking for the smallest possible angle between the vectors, it must be 30 degrees.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake. The cross product magnitude is 7, and the product of the magnitudes is 14, so sin(theta) is 0.5. That's correct. The angle whose sine is 0.5 is indeed 30 degrees, and since angles between vectors are between 0 and 180 degrees, 30 degrees is the smallest possible angle.

So, I think the answer is 30 degrees. Let me just recap to ensure I didn't skip any steps or make any calculation errors.

1. Calculated the magnitude of the cross product: sqrt(3² + 2² + 6²) = 7.
2. Set that equal to ||a|| ||b|| sin(theta): 7 = 2*7*sin(theta).
3. Simplified to sin(theta) = 1/2.
4. Concluded theta is 30 degrees since it's the smallest angle with sine 1/2.

Yep, that all checks out. I don't think I made any mistakes here. So, the smallest possible angle is 30 degrees.

**Final Answer**
The smallest possible angle between vectors a and b is \boxed{30} degrees.
</think>

Given vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the smallest possible angle between them.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin(\theta)
\]

we substitute the known values:

\[
7 = 2 \times 7 \times \sin(\theta)
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin(\theta)
\]

Solving for \(\sin(\theta)\):

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is 30 degrees, as it is the smallest angle between 0 and 180 degrees.

Thus, the smallest possible angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the sum of the zeros of the function g(x), which is defined as f(x + 5). The function f is given by f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that if you have a function f(x) and you define another function g(x) = f(x + 5), this is a horizontal shift of the original function f(x). Specifically, shifting it 5 units to the left. So, the graph of g(x) is just the graph of f(x) moved 5 units to the left. 

Now, the question is about the sum of the zeros of g(x). Zeros of a function are the x-values where the function crosses the x-axis, meaning g(x) = 0. Since g(x) is a cubic function, it should have three zeros (real or complex), and the sum of these zeros can be found using Vieta's formulas.

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For a cubic polynomial of the form ax³ + bx² + cx + d, the sum of the roots is -b/a. So, if I can express g(x) in standard form, I can apply Vieta's formula to find the sum of its zeros.

But wait, maybe there's a shortcut here. Since g(x) is just a horizontal shift of f(x), the roots of g(x) are related to the roots of f(x). If r is a root of f(x), then r - 5 would be a root of g(x), because g(x) = f(x + 5). So, if f(r) = 0, then g(r - 5) = f((r - 5) + 5) = f(r) = 0. That makes sense.

Therefore, each root of g(x) is 5 less than a root of f(x). So, if I denote the roots of f(x) as α, β, and γ, then the roots of g(x) would be α - 5, β - 5, and γ - 5. 

Now, the sum of the roots of g(x) would be (α - 5) + (β - 5) + (γ - 5) = (α + β + γ) - 15. 

But I already know the sum of the roots of f(x) from Vieta's formula. For f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015, the sum of the roots α + β + γ is equal to -(-49)/1 = 49. 

So, substituting back, the sum of the roots of g(x) is 49 - 15 = 34. 

Wait, let me double-check that. If each root is shifted left by 5, then each root is decreased by 5, so the total sum decreases by 15. Since the original sum was 49, subtracting 15 gives 34. That seems right.

Alternatively, I could expand g(x) = f(x + 5) and then apply Vieta's formula directly. Let me try that to confirm.

So, f(x) = x³ - 49x² + 623x - 2015. Then, f(x + 5) would be:

(x + 5)³ - 49(x + 5)² + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Let me compute each term step by step.

First, (x + 5)³. Expanding that:

(x + 5)³ = x³ + 3*5*x² + 3*5²*x + 5³ = x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Next, -49(x + 5)². Let's compute (x + 5)² first:

(x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25. Then, multiplying by -49:

-49x² - 490x - 1225.

Then, 623(x + 5) is 623x + 3115.

And finally, subtracting 2015.

Now, let's add all these together:

First term: x³ + 15x² + 75x + 125.

Second term: -49x² - 490x - 1225.

Third term: +623x + 3115.

Fourth term: -2015.

Now, combine like terms.

Start with x³: only one term, so x³.

Next, x² terms: 15x² - 49x² = -34x².

x terms: 75x - 490x + 623x. Let's compute that: 75 - 490 is -415, then -415 + 623 is 208. So, 208x.

Constant terms: 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015. Let's compute step by step:

125 - 1225 = -1100.

-1100 + 3115 = 2015.

2015 - 2015 = 0.

So, putting it all together, g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x + 0, which simplifies to x³ - 34x² + 208x.

Wait, that's interesting. So, g(x) is x³ - 34x² + 208x. So, the constant term is zero, which makes sense because if we plug x=0 into g(x), we get f(5). Let me check f(5):

f(5) = 5³ - 49*5² + 623*5 - 2015.

Compute that:

125 - 49*25 + 3115 - 2015.

125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015.

125 - 1225 is -1100.

-1100 + 3115 is 2015.

2015 - 2015 is 0. So, yes, f(5) = 0, which means x=0 is a root of g(x). That's why the constant term is zero.

But anyway, back to the sum of the roots. For g(x) = x³ - 34x² + 208x, the sum of the roots is -(-34)/1 = 34. So, that confirms my earlier result.

Therefore, the sum of the zeros of g(x) is 34.

**Final Answer**
The sum of the zeros of the function \( g \) is \boxed{34}.
</think>

To find the sum of the zeros of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we can use the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

1. The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. Therefore, if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).
2. Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). The roots of \( g(x) \) will then be \( \alpha - 5, \beta - 5, \gamma - 5 \).
3. The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by Vieta's formula: \( \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 49 \).
4. The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \( (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) = (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \).

Thus, the sum of the zeros of the function \( g \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: compute the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Hmm, that looks a bit intimidating at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}\) is the same as \(\sec^2 \theta\), and similarly, \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}\) is \(\csc^2 \theta\). So, maybe rewriting the expression in terms of secant and cosecant could help. Let me write that down:

\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

I wonder if there are any trigonometric identities that relate these terms. I know that \(\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta\) and \(\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta\). Maybe substituting these in could simplify things.

So, substituting, we get:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Simplifying that, it becomes:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Hmm, okay, so now I have three terms: 3, \(\tan^2 10^\circ\), and two \(\cot^2\) terms. I need to find a way to relate these angles or find some identity that can connect them.

I notice that 10°, 20°, and 40° are all multiples of 10°, and 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are related through doubling angles. Maybe there's a connection there.

Let me recall that \(\cot \theta = \tan(90^\circ - \theta)\). So, \(\cot 20^\circ = \tan 70^\circ\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \tan 50^\circ\). So, substituting that in, the expression becomes:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ
\]

Hmm, so now I have three tangent squared terms. Maybe I can find a relationship between these angles. Let me see: 10°, 50°, and 70°. Wait, 10° + 50° = 60°, and 50° + 70° = 120°, but I'm not sure if that helps.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\tan^2 \theta\). I remember that \(\tan^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{1 + \cos 2\theta}\). Let me try that.

So, applying that identity to each term:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 20^\circ}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\tan^2 50^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 100^\circ}{1 + \cos 100^\circ}
\]
\[
\tan^2 70^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 140^\circ}{1 + \cos 140^\circ}
\]

Hmm, so substituting these back into the expression, we get:

\[
3 + \frac{1 - \cos 20^\circ}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1 - \cos 100^\circ}{1 + \cos 100^\circ} + \frac{1 - \cos 140^\circ}{1 + \cos 140^\circ}
\]

This seems a bit complicated, but maybe I can simplify each fraction. Let me consider each term separately.

Starting with \(\frac{1 - \cos 20^\circ}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}\). I remember that \(\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} = \tan^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\). So, applying that:

\[
\frac{1 - \cos 20^\circ}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} = \tan^2 10^\circ
\]
Wait, that's just going back to where I started. Maybe that's not helpful.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity \(\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{1 + \cos \theta} = \left( \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \right)^2 = \tan^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\). So, for each term:

\[
\frac{1 - \cos 20^\circ}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} = \tan^2 10^\circ
\]
\[
\frac{1 - \cos 100^\circ}{1 + \cos 100^\circ} = \tan^2 50^\circ
\]
\[
\frac{1 - \cos 140^\circ}{1 + \cos 140^\circ} = \tan^2 70^\circ
\]

So, substituting back, we have:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ
\]

Wait, that's the same as before. So, this approach isn't getting me anywhere. Maybe I need a different strategy.

Let me think about the original expression again: \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Maybe instead of converting to secant and cosecant, I can find a common angle or use some product-to-sum identities.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\) or \(\cos 3\theta\) since 10°, 20°, 40° are related through tripling or something.

Wait, 10°, 20°, 40°, 80°, etc., are all related through doubling. Maybe I can use the double-angle formulas.

Let me recall that \(\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). Maybe that can help relate the terms.

Alternatively, perhaps I can express all terms in terms of sine or cosine of the same angle. Let me see.

First, note that \(\cos 10^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), since \(\cos \theta = \sin(90^\circ - \theta)\). So, \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ}\). So, the original expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

So, now all terms are in terms of sine squared. Maybe this is helpful.

I remember that there's an identity for the sum of cosecants squared for angles in arithmetic progression. Let me recall that.

I think the identity is:

\[
\csc^2 \theta + \csc^2 (60^\circ - \theta) + \csc^2 (60^\circ + \theta) = 4
\]

Wait, is that correct? Let me check for a specific angle. Let me take \(\theta = 10^\circ\). Then, the angles would be 10°, 50°, and 70°, which are not exactly the angles in our problem. Hmm, but in our case, the angles are 20°, 40°, 80°, which are 20°, 40°, 80°, which are not in arithmetic progression with 60°.

Wait, but 20°, 40°, 80° are each double the previous angle. Maybe that's a different identity.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for the sum of three cosecants squared with angles adding up to 180°, but 20° + 40° + 80° = 140°, which is less than 180°, so that might not help.

Wait, another thought: maybe using the identity for \(\sin 3\theta\). Let me recall that:

\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]

But I'm not sure how that would help here.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\sin A + \sin B + \sin C\) or something similar, but since we have reciprocals squared, that might not be directly applicable.

Wait, another idea: maybe express each term in terms of tangent, since I know that \(\tan 3\theta\) can be expressed in terms of \(\tan \theta\). Let me see.

Let me consider that 3 * 10° = 30°, 3 * 20° = 60°, 3 * 40° = 120°, which are all angles with known sine and cosine values. Maybe that can help.

Let me recall that:

\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3 \tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3 \tan^2 \theta}
\]

So, for \(\theta = 10^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3 \tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3 \tan^2 10^\circ}
\]

Similarly, for \(\theta = 20^\circ\):

\[
\tan 60^\circ = \frac{3 \tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3 \tan^2 20^\circ}
\]

And for \(\theta = 40^\circ\):

\[
\tan 120^\circ = \frac{3 \tan 40^\circ - \tan^3 40^\circ}{1 - 3 \tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

But I'm not sure how this helps with the sum of the reciprocals squared. Maybe I need a different approach.

Wait, perhaps I can use the identity that relates the sum of squares of sine and cosine. But in this case, we have reciprocals, so maybe not directly.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\sin^2 \theta + \sin^2 (60^\circ - \theta) + \sin^2 (60^\circ + \theta) = \frac{3}{4}\). But again, not sure how that would help with reciprocals.

Wait, another thought: perhaps using the identity for \(\sin^2 \theta = \frac{1 - \cos 2\theta}{2}\). So, taking reciprocals, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 2\theta}
\]

Similarly, \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 2\theta}\).

So, applying this to each term:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

So, substituting back, the original expression becomes:

\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

Hmm, that's interesting. Now, I have three terms, each of which is 2 divided by (1 ± cos something). Maybe I can combine these fractions or find a common denominator.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity for \(\cos A - \cos B\) or something similar. Let me recall that:

\[
\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right)
\]

But I'm not sure if that's directly applicable here.

Wait, another idea: perhaps express each denominator in terms of sine or cosine of complementary angles.

For example, \(1 + \cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ\), and \(1 - \cos 40^\circ = 2 \sin^2 20^\circ\), and \(1 - \cos 80^\circ = 2 \sin^2 40^\circ\). Wait, that's just going back to the original terms. Hmm.

Wait, but if I use that, then:

\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{2 \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}
\]
Which is the original term. So, that doesn't help.

Alternatively, maybe I can use the identity for \(\cos 3\theta\). Let me recall that:

\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta
\]

But again, not sure how that would help here.

Wait, perhaps I can consider the sum of the three terms:

"Okay, so I have this equation to solve: \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is the inverse tangent function, which gives me an angle whose tangent is \(x\). Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is the inverse cotangent function, giving me an angle whose cotangent is \(\frac{1}{x}\). 

Wait a second, I think there's a relationship between \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}(x)\). Let me recall... Oh yeah, I remember that \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\) for all \(x\). Is that right? Let me verify. If I take \(x = 1\), then \(\tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\cot^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so their sum is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). That seems correct. So, in general, \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}\).

But in the problem, it's \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Hmm, is there a similar identity for that? Let me think. I know that \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) for \(y > 0\). So, if I let \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, is that right? Let me check with \(x = 1\). Then \(\cot^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\) and \(\tan^{-1}(1) = \frac{\pi}{4}\), so yes, that works. So, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\).

So, substituting that into the original equation, the argument inside the sine function becomes \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x)\), which is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). So, the equation simplifies to \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\).

Alright, so now I have \(\sin(2 \theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). I can use the double-angle identity for sine: \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). So, substituting that in, I get \(2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}\).

But I also know that \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), so let me express \(\sin \theta\) and \(\cos \theta\) in terms of \(x\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then in a right triangle, the opposite side is \(x\) and the adjacent side is 1, so the hypotenuse is \(\sqrt{x^2 + 1}\). Therefore, \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\).

Substituting these into the equation, I get:
\[2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[2 \cdot \frac{x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\]
So, \(\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Now, I can solve for \(x\). Let's cross-multiply:
\[2x \cdot 3 = 1 \cdot (x^2 + 1)\]
Which simplifies to:
\[6x = x^2 + 1\]
Bringing all terms to one side:
\[x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\]
This is a quadratic equation in \(x\). Let me use the quadratic formula to solve it. The quadratic is \(x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0\), so \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\).

The quadratic formula is \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\). Plugging in the values:
\[x = \frac{-(-6) \pm \sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1}\]
Simplify:
\[x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}\]
Simplify \(\sqrt{32}\) as \(4 \sqrt{2}\):
\[x = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
Divide numerator terms by 2:
\[x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\]

So, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). 

Wait, but I should check if these solutions are valid in the original equation because sometimes when dealing with inverse trigonometric functions, there might be restrictions on the domain or range.

Let me recall the domains and ranges. The function \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is defined for all real numbers, and its range is \((-\frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2})\). Similarly, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is defined for \(x \neq 0\), and its range is \((0, \pi)\). 

But in our case, since we have \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), let's see what their sum is. Earlier, we found that \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x)\). Wait, no, actually, earlier I thought that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), but let me verify that again.

Wait, actually, \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) only when \(y > 0\). So, if \(x > 0\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\). But if \(x < 0\), then \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) would be \(\pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\), because \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) for negative \(y\) is in a different quadrant.

Wait, hold on, maybe I made a mistake earlier. Let me think carefully.

The identity \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\) is only true when \(y > 0\). If \(y < 0\), then \(\cot^{-1}(y)\) is actually equal to \(\pi + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{y}\right)\). So, in our case, since \(y = \frac{1}{x}\), if \(x > 0\), then \(y > 0\), and the identity holds. If \(x < 0\), then \(y < 0\), so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \pi + \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{x}}\right) = \pi + \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Therefore, the sum \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) is equal to:

- If \(x > 0\): \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x)\)
- If \(x < 0\): \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \pi + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi\)

So, in the original equation, depending on the sign of \(x\), the argument inside the sine function is either \(2 \tan^{-1}(x)\) or \(2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi\).

But in our earlier steps, we assumed that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\), which is only true for \(x > 0\). So, we might have missed the case when \(x < 0\).

Therefore, I need to consider both cases: \(x > 0\) and \(x < 0\).

Case 1: \(x > 0\)

As before, the equation becomes \(\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\). We solved this and got \(x = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\). But since \(x > 0\), both solutions are positive because \(3 + 2\sqrt{2} \approx 3 + 2.828 \approx 5.828\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2} \approx 3 - 2.828 \approx 0.172\), both positive. So, both are valid in this case.

Case 2: \(x < 0\)

In this case, the argument inside the sine function is \(2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi\). So, the equation becomes:
\[\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x) + \pi) = \frac{1}{3}\]

But \(\sin(\theta + \pi) = -\sin \theta\), so this simplifies to:
\[-\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = \frac{1}{3}\]
Which means:
\[\sin(2 \tan^{-1}(x)) = -\frac{1}{3}\]

Again, using the double-angle identity:
\[2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = -\frac{1}{3}\]
Where \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). As before, \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}\). Substituting:
\[2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}} = -\frac{1}{3}\]
Simplify:
\[\frac{2x}{x^2 + 1} = -\frac{1}{3}\]
Cross-multiplying:
\[6x = - (x^2 + 1)\]
Bring all terms to one side:
\[x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0\]
Quadratic equation: \(x^2 + 6x + 1 = 0\). Using quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{-6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2}\]
\[x = \frac{-6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2}\]
Simplify:
\[x = -3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}\]

So, the solutions are \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). Now, since we are in the case \(x < 0\), let's check the values:

- \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\): \(2\sqrt{2} \approx 2.828\), so \(-3 + 2.828 \approx -0.172\), which is negative.
- \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\): Approximately \(-3 - 2.828 \approx -5.828\), which is also negative.

So, both solutions are valid in this case.

Therefore, combining both cases, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\), \(x = -3 + 2\sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -3 - 2\sqrt{2}\).

But wait, let me verify if all these solutions satisfy the original equation because sometimes when we square or manipulate equations, we might introduce extraneous solutions.

Let me test each solution:

1. \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\):
   - Compute \(\tan^{-1}(x)\): Let's denote this as \(\theta\). Then, \(\tan \theta = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\).
   - Compute \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\): Since \(x > 0\), this is \(\tan^{-1}(x)\), so same as above.
   - So, the argument is \(2\theta\). Then, \(\sin(2\theta)\).
   - From earlier, we have \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is correct.

2. \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\):
   - Similarly, \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) is some angle \(\theta\), and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x)\).
   - So, the argument is \(2\theta\), and \(\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is correct.

"Okay, so I have this problem where there are two lines given in 3D space, and I need to find the distance between them. The lines are defined parametrically, which I remember means they're expressed in terms of a parameter, like t and u here. The first line is given by the vector equation:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

And the second line is:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The problem also mentions that these two lines are parallel. Hmm, okay, so if they're parallel, that means their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. Let me check that first to make sure I understand why they're parallel.

Looking at the direction vectors:

First line's direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

Second line's direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

I notice that if I multiply the first direction vector by 2, I get:

\(2 \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\), which is exactly the direction vector of the second line. So yes, they are scalar multiples, specifically, the second direction vector is twice the first. That confirms they are parallel.

Now, since the lines are parallel, the distance between them should be constant, right? So I don't have to worry about them skewing or anything; the distance is the same everywhere. To find this distance, I think I can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space.

I recall that the distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:

\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|}
\]

Where \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the lines (since they're parallel, both have the same direction vector, or scalar multiples), and \(\vec{w}\) is the vector connecting any two points on the two lines.

Wait, let me make sure I remember this correctly. I think it's the magnitude of the cross product of the direction vector and the vector connecting the two points, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector. Yeah, that sounds right.

So, first, I need to find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Let's take the points when the parameters t and u are zero, since that's the simplest.

For the first line, when \(t = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

For the second line, when \(u = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

So, the vector connecting these two points, let's call it \(\vec{w}\), is:

\[
\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 - (-10) \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Okay, so \(\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, I need the direction vector \(\vec{v}\). Since both lines are parallel, I can take the direction vector from either line. Let's take the first one:

\[
\vec{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need to compute the cross product of \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\). Let me recall how to compute a cross product. For two vectors \(\vec{a} = \begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\), the cross product \(\vec{a} \times \vec{b}\) is:

\[
\vec{a} \times \vec{b} = \begin{pmatrix} a_2 b_3 - a_3 b_2 \\ a_3 b_1 - a_1 b_3 \\ a_1 b_2 - a_2 b_1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

So, applying this to \(\vec{v}\) and \(\vec{w}\):

\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) \\ (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) \\ (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) \end{pmatrix}
\]

Let me compute each component step by step.

First component: \((-9)(5) - (-2)(7) = -45 + 14 = -31\)

Second component: \((-2)(-8) - (2)(5) = 16 - 10 = 6\)

Third component: \((2)(7) - (-9)(-8) = 14 - 72 = -58\)

So, the cross product is:

\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, I need the magnitude of this cross product vector. The magnitude \(|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|\) is calculated as:

\[
|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2}
\]

Calculating each term:

\((-31)^2 = 961\)

\(6^2 = 36\)

\((-58)^2 = 3364\)

Adding them up: \(961 + 36 + 3364 = 961 + 36 is 997, plus 3364 is 4361\).

So, \(|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}| = \sqrt{4361}\)

Hmm, let me see if 4361 is a perfect square. Let me try dividing by some squares. 66 squared is 4356, which is close. 66^2 = 4356, so 4361 is 66^2 + 5, which is 4356 + 5 = 4361. So, it's not a perfect square. So, I can leave it as \(\sqrt{4361}\) for now.

Next, I need the magnitude of the direction vector \(\vec{v}\). The direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so its magnitude is:

\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

So, \(|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{89}\).

Now, plugging these into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}}
\]

I can simplify this by dividing the square roots:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}}
\]

Let me compute 4361 divided by 89. Let's see, 89 times 49 is 4361 because 89*50=4450, which is 89 more than 4361, so 4450 - 89 = 4361, so 89*49=4361.

So, \(\frac{4361}{89} = 49\). Therefore, the square root of 49 is 7.

So, \(d = \sqrt{49} = 7\).

Wait, that's nice! So, the distance between the two lines is 7 units.

Let me just recap to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. I found the connecting vector between two points on the lines, computed the cross product with the direction vector, found its magnitude, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector, and simplified. It all checks out.

I think that's the correct answer. So, the distance is 7.

**Final Answer**
The distance between the two parallel lines is \boxed{7}.
</think>

The two given lines are parallel, as their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. To find the distance between them, we use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space:

\[
d = \frac{|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}|}{|\vec{v}|}
\]

where \(\vec{v}\) is the direction vector of the lines and \(\vec{w}\) is the vector connecting any two points on the lines.

1. The direction vector \(\vec{v}\) is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).
2. The vector connecting points on the two lines is \(\vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).
3. Compute the cross product \(\vec{v} \times \vec{w}\):

\[
\vec{v} \times \vec{w} = \begin{pmatrix} (-9)(5) - (-2)(7) \\ (-2)(-8) - (2)(5) \\ (2)(7) - (-9)(-8) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

4. Calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
|\vec{v} \times \vec{w}| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

5. Calculate the magnitude of the direction vector:

\[
|\vec{v}| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

6. Compute the distance:

\[
d = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

The distance between the two parallel lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to compute the cross product of two vectors, specifically (2b - a) cross (3c + a). I'm given the cross products of a, b, and c with each other: a cross b, a cross c, and b cross c. Hmm, let me write those down to keep track.

Given:
- a × b = [6, -7, 3]
- a × c = [4, 7, 2]
- b × c = [1, -7, 18]

I need to find (2b - a) × (3c + a). Hmm, cross product is distributive over vector addition, right? So I can expand this expression using the distributive property. Let me recall the formula for the cross product of two vectors: (u + v) × (w + x) = u × w + u × x + v × w + v × x. So applying that here, I can expand (2b - a) × (3c + a) into four terms.

Let me write that out:

(2b - a) × (3c + a) = 2b × 3c + 2b × a + (-a) × 3c + (-a) × a.

Wait, hold on, cross product is anti-commutative, meaning u × v = -v × u. So maybe I can simplify some terms here.

First, let's compute each term step by step.

1. 2b × 3c: The scalar multiples can be factored out, so this is 2*3*(b × c) = 6*(b × c). I know b × c is [1, -7, 18], so multiplying by 6 gives [6, -42, 108].

2. 2b × a: Again, scalar multiple can be factored out, so 2*(b × a). But b × a is equal to - (a × b). Since a × b is [6, -7, 3], then b × a is [-6, 7, -3]. So 2*(b × a) is 2*[-6, 7, -3] = [-12, 14, -6].

3. (-a) × 3c: Similarly, scalar multiples can be factored out, so -1*3*(a × c) = -3*(a × c). a × c is [4, 7, 2], so multiplying by -3 gives [-12, -21, -6].

4. (-a) × a: Hmm, cross product of a vector with itself is zero. So this term is zero.

So now, adding up all four terms:

First term: [6, -42, 108]
Second term: [-12, 14, -6]
Third term: [-12, -21, -6]
Fourth term: [0, 0, 0]

Let me add them component-wise.

For the x-component: 6 + (-12) + (-12) + 0 = 6 -12 -12 = -18

For the y-component: -42 + 14 + (-21) + 0 = -42 +14 -21 = (-42 -21) +14 = -63 +14 = -49

For the z-component: 108 + (-6) + (-6) + 0 = 108 -6 -6 = 96

So putting it all together, the cross product is [-18, -49, 96].

Wait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes.

First term: 6*(1, -7, 18) = (6, -42, 108) – correct.

Second term: 2*(b × a) = 2*(-6, 7, -3) = (-12, 14, -6) – correct.

Third term: -3*(4,7,2) = (-12, -21, -6) – correct.

Fourth term: 0 – correct.

Adding x-components: 6 -12 -12 = -18 – correct.

Adding y-components: -42 +14 -21 = -49 – correct.

Adding z-components: 108 -6 -6 = 96 – correct.

So yeah, the result is [-18, -49, 96]. I think that's the answer.

But just to make sure, let me think if there's another way to approach this problem. Maybe using properties of cross products or something else. Hmm, another approach could be to express (2b - a) × (3c + a) as 2b × 3c + 2b × a - a × 3c - a × a, which is the same as before. So yeah, same result.

Alternatively, maybe using the linearity of cross product. Since cross product is linear in both arguments, so yeah, the expansion is valid.

I think I'm confident with this result. So the final answer is [-18, -49, 96].

**Final Answer**
The cross product is \boxed{\begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}}.
</think>

Given the cross products of vectors \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

We need to compute \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

Using the distributive property of the cross product, we expand the expression:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Calculating each term separately:

1. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}\)
2. \(2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
3. \(-\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = -3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}\)
4. \(-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\)

Adding these results component-wise:

- For the x-component: \(6 - 12 - 12 + 0 = -18\)
- For the y-component: \(-42 + 14 - 21 + 0 = -49\)
- For the z-component: \(108 - 6 - 6 + 0 = 96\)

"Zdaj se je začel razmišljanje, kako rešiti to problem. Najprej moram razumeti, kaj je vprašano. Vprašanje je: Kakšna je bila povprečna cena, v centih, njegovih znamk iz 70-ih? Potem je treba izračunati povprečno ceno in je treba zaokrožiti na najbližjo desetinko centa.

Prvi korak je, da si ogledam podatke iz grafa. Grafični predstavitev je Asymptote koda, ki je predstavljena z mrežo. V mreži so števila, ki predstavljajo število znamk po državah in desetletjih. V prvi stolpci so države: Brazilija, Francija, Peru in Španija. V vrsticah so desetletja: 50-ji, 60-ji, 70-ji in 80-ji.

Za 70-je je treba izbrati števila iz stolpca ""70s"". V tem stolpcu so števila: 12, 12, 6 in 13. To pomeni, da je Juan imel 12 znamk iz Brazilije, 12 iz Francije, 6 iz Peru in 13 iz Španije iz 70-ih.

Najprej moram izračunati skupno število znamk iz 70-ih. To je 12 + 12 + 6 + 13. Dodačem: 12 + 12 je 24, 24 + 6 je 30, 30 + 13 je 43. Skupno je 43 znamk iz 70-ih.

Sedaj moram izračunati skupno ceno teh znamk. Vsaka država je povezana s svojo ceno: Brazilija in Francija so 6 centov vsaka, Peru je 4 centi vsaka, Španija je 5 centov vsaka.

Zato je skupna cena:
- Znamke iz Brazilije: 12 znamk × 6 centov = 72 centov
- Znamke iz Francije: 12 znamk × 6 centov = 72 centov
- Znamke iz Peru: 6 znamk × 4 centov = 24 centov
- Znamke iz Španije: 13 znamk × 5 centov = 65 centov

Skupaj je to 72 + 72 + 24 + 65. Dodačem: 72 + 72 je 144, 144 + 24 je 168, 168 + 65 je 233 centov.

Zdaj je treba izračunati povprečno ceno. Povprečna cena je skupna cena deljena s številom znamk. Torej, 233 centov / 43 znamk. Vračam se, kolik je to? 43 × 5 je 215, 233 - 215 je 18, tako da je 5 in 18/43. 18/43 je približno 0.4186. Torej, povprečna cena je približno 5.4186 centov.

Zaokrožitev na najbližjo desetinko centa je 5.4 centov, ker je 0.4186 najbližje 0.4 kot 0.5.

Zato je povprečna cena 5.4 centov.

"Okay, so I have this trapezoid ABCD where AD is parallel to BC. They also told me that AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC bisects angle BAD. The area of the trapezoid is 42, and I need to find the area of triangle ACD. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me draw the trapezoid. Since AD is parallel to BC, I can imagine AD as the longer base and BC as the shorter base, but I'm not sure yet. Let me label the vertices: A, B, C, D in order, so that AD and BC are the two bases. So, sides AB and CD are the non-parallel sides.

Now, AC is perpendicular to CD. That means that the diagonal AC forms a right angle with side CD. Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC is equal to angle CAD. That might be useful for some angle bisector theorem or something.

The area of the trapezoid is given as 42. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is (1/2)*(sum of the two bases)*height. So, if I can find the lengths of the bases and the height, I can maybe relate them to the area.

But I don't know the lengths of any sides yet. Maybe I can assign some variables. Let me denote the length of AD as 'a' and BC as 'b'. The height of the trapezoid would be the distance between the two bases, which I can call 'h'. So, the area is (1/2)*(a + b)*h = 42.

Now, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is a right triangle with right angle at C. So, the area of triangle ACD would be (1/2)*AC*CD. But I don't know AC or CD yet.

Wait, but maybe I can express AC and CD in terms of the trapezoid's sides. Since AC is a diagonal, maybe I can use some properties of trapezoids or triangles here.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, angle BAC = angle CAD. Let me denote angle BAD as 2θ, so each of the angles BAC and CAD is θ.

Since AD is parallel to BC, the consecutive angles are supplementary. So, angle ADC + angle BCD = 180 degrees. But I'm not sure if that helps directly.

Wait, maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem. In triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD. So, according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of the adjacent sides is equal to the ratio of the segments created on side BD.

But wait, in this case, AC is the angle bisector, but BD is not necessarily a side of the triangle. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.

Alternatively, since AC is perpendicular to CD, triangle ACD is right-angled at C. So, maybe I can use some right triangle properties here.

Let me try to assign coordinates to the trapezoid to make it easier. Let me place point A at the origin (0,0). Since AD is parallel to BC, and let's assume AD is horizontal for simplicity. So, point D would be at (a, 0). Point B is somewhere above A, and point C is somewhere above D.

Since AC is perpendicular to CD, and AC is a diagonal from A to C, which is somewhere above D. Let me denote point C as (c, h), where h is the height of the trapezoid. Then, point B would be somewhere above A, but since BC is parallel to AD, the y-coordinate of B should also be h. So, point B is at (d, h), and point C is at (c, h). Since BC is parallel to AD, the length of BC is |c - d|, and the length of AD is a.

Now, AC is the diagonal from A(0,0) to C(c, h). The slope of AC is h/c. Since AC is perpendicular to CD, the slope of CD should be the negative reciprocal of h/c, which is -c/h.

But CD goes from C(c, h) to D(a, 0). So, the slope of CD is (0 - h)/(a - c) = -h/(a - c). Therefore, we have that -h/(a - c) = -c/h. So, h/(a - c) = c/h. Cross-multiplying, h^2 = c(a - c). So, h^2 = ac - c^2.

That's one equation.

Also, since AC bisects angle BAD, which is at point A. So, angle BAC = angle CAD. Let me compute the slopes of AB and AD to find the angles.

Wait, AB goes from A(0,0) to B(d, h). So, the slope of AB is h/d. The angle that AB makes with the x-axis is arctan(h/d). Similarly, AD is along the x-axis, so angle BAD is the angle between AB and AD, which is arctan(h/d).

But AC is the angle bisector, so the angle between AC and AD is half of angle BAD. The slope of AC is h/c, so the angle that AC makes with the x-axis is arctan(h/c). Therefore, arctan(h/c) = (1/2)*arctan(h/d).

Hmm, that seems a bit complicated. Maybe I can use the angle bisector theorem in triangle ABD.

Wait, in triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD. So, according to the angle bisector theorem, the ratio of AB to AD is equal to the ratio of BC to CD.

Wait, no, the angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. But in this case, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so it should divide side BD into segments proportional to AB and AD.

But BD is the diagonal from B to D. So, if AC intersects BD at some point, say E, then BE/ED = AB/AD.

But I don't know where E is. Maybe this is getting too complicated.

Alternatively, since AC is the angle bisector, maybe I can use trigonometric identities.

Let me denote angle BAC = angle CAD = θ. Then, angle BAD = 2θ.

In triangle ABC, which is not necessarily a right triangle, but AC is a side. Wait, but AC is perpendicular to CD, so triangle ACD is right-angled.

Wait, maybe I can express the lengths in terms of θ.

In triangle ACD, which is right-angled at C, AC is one leg, CD is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse. So, AC = AD * cos(theta), and CD = AD * sin(theta). Wait, is that correct?

Wait, no. In triangle ACD, angle at A is theta, because AC bisects angle BAD, which is 2θ. So, angle at A is theta, angle at C is 90 degrees, so angle at D is 90 - theta.

Therefore, in triangle ACD, AC = AD * cos(theta), and CD = AD * sin(theta). So, AC = a * cos(theta), CD = a * sin(theta).

But also, in triangle ABC, which is not right-angled, but AC is a side. Wait, maybe I can relate the sides using the angle bisector.

Alternatively, since AC is the angle bisector, maybe I can use the formula for the length of the angle bisector.

The formula for the length of an angle bisector in a triangle is:

If in triangle ABC, the angle bisector from A meets BC at D, then the length of AD is (2ab cos(theta/2))/(a + b), where a and b are the lengths of the sides adjacent to angle A.

But in our case, it's a trapezoid, not a triangle, so maybe this isn't directly applicable.

Wait, but maybe I can consider triangle ABD, where AC is the angle bisector. So, in triangle ABD, AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, so by the angle bisector theorem, AB/AD = BC/CD.

Wait, is that correct? Let me recall the angle bisector theorem: in a triangle, the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides.

So, in triangle ABD, if AC is the angle bisector of angle BAD, then it should divide BD into segments proportional to AB and AD. So, if AC intersects BD at point E, then BE/ED = AB/AD.

But I don't know where E is, so maybe this isn't helpful.

Alternatively, maybe I can use coordinates again.

We have point A at (0,0), D at (a,0), C at (c,h), and B at (d,h). Since AC is perpendicular to CD, we have the slope condition: (h)/(c) * (-h)/(a - c) = -1, which simplifies to h^2 = c(a - c), as before.

Also, AC bisects angle BAD. So, the angle between AC and AD is equal to the angle between AC and AB.

The angle between AC and AD can be found using the dot product. Vector AC is (c, h), and vector AD is (a, 0). The angle between them is theta, so cos(theta) = (c*a + h*0)/(sqrt(c^2 + h^2)*sqrt(a^2)) = (c a)/(a sqrt(c^2 + h^2)) = c / sqrt(c^2 + h^2).

Similarly, the angle between AC and AB. Vector AB is (d, h), and vector AC is (c, h). The angle between them is also theta, so cos(theta) = (c d + h^2)/(sqrt(c^2 + h^2)*sqrt(d^2 + h^2)).

Since both expressions equal cos(theta), we can set them equal:

c / sqrt(c^2 + h^2) = (c d + h^2)/(sqrt(c^2 + h^2)*sqrt(d^2 + h^2))

Simplify:

c = (c d + h^2)/sqrt(d^2 + h^2)

Multiply both sides by sqrt(d^2 + h^2):

c sqrt(d^2 + h^2) = c d + h^2

Let me square both sides to eliminate the square root:

c^2 (d^2 + h^2) = (c d + h^2)^2

Expand both sides:

c^2 d^2 + c^2 h^2 = c^2 d^2 + 2 c d h^2 + h^4

Subtract c^2 d^2 from both sides:

c^2 h^2 = 2 c d h^2 + h^4

Divide both sides by h^2 (assuming h ≠ 0, which it is since it's a trapezoid):

c^2 = 2 c d + h^2

So, c^2 - 2 c d - h^2 = 0

Hmm, that's another equation.

Earlier, we had h^2 = c(a - c). So, h^2 = a c - c^2.

Let me substitute h^2 from the first equation into the second equation:

c^2 - 2 c d - (a c - c^2) = 0

Simplify:

c^2 - 2 c d - a c + c^2 = 0

Combine like terms:

2 c^2 - 2 c d - a c = 0

Factor out c:

c(2 c - 2 d - a) = 0

Since c ≠ 0 (because point C is not at the origin), we have:

2 c - 2 d - a = 0

So, 2 c - 2 d = a => c - d = a/2 => d = c - a/2

So, d = c - a/2

Okay, so we have d expressed in terms of c and a.

Now, let's recall that BC is parallel to AD, so BC has the same slope as AD, which is 0 since AD is horizontal. Therefore, BC is also horizontal, so the y-coordinates of B and C are the same, which they are (both h). So, the length of BC is |c - d|.

But since d = c - a/2, then BC = |c - (c - a/2)| = |a/2| = a/2.

So, BC = a/2.

So, the length of BC is half the length of AD.

That's a useful relation.

Now, the area of the trapezoid is (1/2)*(AD + BC)*h = 42.

We have AD = a, BC = a/2, so:

(1/2)*(a + a/2)*h = 42

Simplify:

(1/2)*(3a/2)*h = 42 => (3a/4)*h = 42 => 3a h = 168 => a h = 56

So, a h = 56.

We also have from earlier that h^2 = c(a - c). Let's keep that in mind.

Additionally, from the coordinates, the length of AB can be found. Point A is (0,0), point B is (d, h) = (c - a/2, h). So, AB has length sqrt((c - a/2)^2 + h^2).

Similarly, the length of CD is sqrt((a - c)^2 + h^2). But from triangle ACD, which is right-angled at C, CD is one leg, AC is the other leg, and AD is the hypotenuse.

Wait, in triangle ACD, right-angled at C, so AC^2 + CD^2 = AD^2.

AC is the distance from A(0,0) to C(c, h), which is sqrt(c^2 + h^2).

CD is the distance from C(c, h) to D(a, 0), which is sqrt((a - c)^2 + h^2).

AD is the distance from A(0,0) to D(a, 0), which is a.

So, AC^2 + CD^2 = AD^2:

(c^2 + h^2) + ((a - c)^2 + h^2) = a^2

Simplify:

c^2 + h^2 + a^2 - 2 a c + c^2 + h^2 = a^2

Combine like terms:

2 c^2 + 2 h^2 + a^2 - 2 a c = a^2

Subtract a^2 from both sides:

2 c^2 + 2 h^2 - 2 a c = 0

Divide both sides by 2:

c^2 + h^2 - a c = 0

But from earlier, we have h^2 = a c - c^2","[0, '0']",28,"[28, '28']",False

"Okay, so I have this problem where four points A, B, C, and D are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle. I need to find the probability that the chords AB and CD intersect. Hmm, interesting. Let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, I remember that when dealing with points on a circle, the probability often relates to the arrangement of these points. Since the points are chosen randomly, their positions are uniformly distributed around the circumference. So, maybe I can fix one point and analyze the positions of the others relative to it. That might simplify things.

Let me fix point A somewhere on the circle. Since the circle is continuous and symmetrical, fixing one point doesn't affect the generality of the problem. Now, the positions of points B, C, and D are still random. I need to figure out the conditions under which chords AB and CD intersect.

I recall that two chords in a circle intersect if and only if the four endpoints are arranged in an alternating order around the circle. That is, if we go around the circle, we encounter the points in the order A, C, B, D, or A, D, B, C, or any rotation of these. If the points are in such an order, the chords AB and CD will cross each other inside the circle. If they are in a different order, like A, B, C, D, then the chords won't intersect.

So, the key is to determine the probability that points C and D are placed in such a way that they alternate with A and B. Since I fixed point A, let's consider the positions of B, C, and D relative to A.

After fixing A, the positions of B, C, and D can be anywhere on the circumference. Let me think about the circle as a interval from 0 to 1, where 0 and 1 are the same point (A). Then, the positions of B, C, and D can be represented as three independent uniform random variables on [0,1). 

But maybe it's easier to think in terms of angles. Let me parameterize the circle from 0 to 360 degrees, with A at 0 degrees. Then, the positions of B, C, and D are random angles between 0 and 360. However, since the circle is continuous, the specific angles don't matter as much as their relative order.

So, if I fix A at 0 degrees, the positions of B, C, and D can be anywhere else. The chords AB and CD will intersect if, when we traverse the circle starting at A, we encounter C and D in an alternating order with B. That is, if the order is A, C, B, D or A, D, B, C, or any rotation that maintains this alternation.

Wait, actually, since we fixed A, the order is determined by the positions of B, C, and D relative to A. So, let's consider the circle as a line from A (0) to A (360), and the points B, C, D are somewhere in between. The chords AB and CD intersect if C and D are on different sides of the chord AB. Hmm, is that correct?

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for two chords AB and CD to intersect, the four points must be arranged such that one chord is inside the circle and the other is outside, but I think that's not the right way. Wait, no, both chords are inside the circle, but they can either intersect or not depending on the order of the points.

Let me recall that for four points on a circle, the probability that two specific chords intersect is 1/3. Is that the case here? Wait, I think that might be the case, but I need to verify it.

Alternatively, maybe I can compute the probability by considering all possible arrangements of the four points. Since the points are chosen independently and uniformly, the probability should be the same regardless of the specific positions, so I can fix one point and analyze the others relative to it.

So, fix point A. Then, the positions of B, C, and D are random. Let me consider the circle as a unit circle for simplicity. The key is to determine the order of the points around the circle. Since the points are randomly placed, all possible orderings are equally likely.

There are 3! = 6 possible orderings of points B, C, D around the circle. Wait, no, actually, since we fixed A, the orderings are relative to A. So, the four points are A, B, C, D. The number of ways to arrange B, C, D around the circle is 3! = 6. But actually, on a circle, the number of distinct orderings is (n-1)! for n points, but since we fixed A, it's just 3! = 6.

Wait, no, actually, fixing A, the number of possible orderings of B, C, D is 3! = 6. Each ordering is equally likely because the points are chosen independently and uniformly.

Now, out of these 6 orderings, how many result in chords AB and CD intersecting? Let's list all possible orderings:

1. A, B, C, D
2. A, B, D, C
3. A, C, B, D
4. A, C, D, B
5. A, D, B, C
6. A, D, C, B

Now, for each ordering, determine if chords AB and CD intersect.

1. A, B, C, D: The order is A, B, C, D. So, chord AB is from A to B, and chord CD is from C to D. Since C and D are both after B, the chords don't intersect.
2. A, B, D, C: Similarly, chord AB is from A to B, chord CD is from D to C. Since D is after B and C is before D, but both are after B, so chords don't intersect.
3. A, C, B, D: Chord AB is from A to B, chord CD is from C to D. Here, C is between A and B, and D is after B. So, chord AB goes from A to B, and chord CD goes from C (inside AB) to D (outside AB). So, these chords intersect.
4. A, C, D, B: Chord AB is from A to B, chord CD is from C to D. C is between A and B, D is also between C and B. So, chord CD is entirely within AB, so chords don't intersect.
5. A, D, B, C: Chord AB is from A to B, chord CD is from D to C. D is between A and B, C is after B. So, chord CD goes from D (inside AB) to C (outside AB). So, these chords intersect.
6. A, D, C, B: Chord AB is from A to B, chord CD is from D to C. D is between A and B, C is also between D and B. So, chord CD is entirely within AB, so chords don't intersect.

So, out of the 6 possible orderings, how many result in intersecting chords? Let's see:

Orderings 3 and 5 result in intersecting chords. So that's 2 out of 6, which simplifies to 1/3.

Wait, so the probability is 1/3? That seems familiar. But let me make sure I didn't miss anything.

Alternatively, another approach: once A is fixed, the positions of B, C, D are random. The chords AB and CD intersect if and only if C and D are on different arcs determined by AB. That is, if one is on the arc from A to B and the other is on the arc from B to A (the other way around the circle).

But since the circle is continuous, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is equal to the probability that one is in the arc AB and the other is in the arc BA.

But wait, the arcs AB and BA are the same in terms of length, but actually, AB is a specific arc, and BA is the other arc. Since the circle is 360 degrees, the arc AB can be of any length depending on where B is placed.

Wait, but since B is also randomly placed, the arc AB is a random arc. So, the probability that C and D are on different arcs AB and BA is equal to the probability that one is in the arc AB and the other is in the arc BA.

But since the circle is uniform, the probability that a random point is in arc AB is equal to the length of arc AB divided by the circumference. But since B is also random, the length of arc AB is uniformly distributed between 0 and 360 degrees.

Wait, this seems more complicated. Maybe I should think in terms of order statistics.

Alternatively, another method: fix point A, then the positions of B, C, D are three random points on the circumference. The probability that chords AB and CD intersect is equal to the probability that C and D are separated by chord AB.

Which is equivalent to C and D being on different sides of chord AB. Since chord AB divides the circle into two arcs, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is equal to 2 * (length of arc AB / circumference) * (length of arc BA / circumference). But since arc AB and arc BA are complementary, their lengths add up to the circumference.

Wait, but since the length of arc AB is random, maybe I need to integrate over all possible positions of B.

Let me denote the circumference as 1 for simplicity. Then, the length of arc AB is a random variable, say, x, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Then, the probability that C and D are on different arcs is 2x(1 - x). Because the probability that C is in arc AB is x, and D is in arc BA is (1 - x), and vice versa.

So, the expected value of 2x(1 - x) over x uniformly distributed from 0 to 1 is the integral from 0 to 1 of 2x(1 - x) dx.

Calculating that integral:

∫₀¹ 2x(1 - x) dx = 2 ∫₀¹ (x - x²) dx = 2 [ (x²/2 - x³/3) ]₀¹ = 2 [ (1/2 - 1/3) - 0 ] = 2 [ (3/6 - 2/6) ] = 2 [1/6] = 1/3.

So, the expected probability is 1/3. Therefore, the probability that chords AB and CD intersect is 1/3.

Wait, that matches the earlier result where out of 6 orderings, 2 resulted in intersection, giving 1/3. So, both methods give the same answer, which is reassuring.

Alternatively, another way to think about it is that for four random points on a circle, the number of intersecting chord pairs is 1 out of the 3 possible pairings. Since there are three ways to pair four points: AB-CD, AC-BD, AD-BC. Each pairing is equally likely, and only one of them results in intersecting chords. Therefore, the probability is 1/3.

Yes, that makes sense too. So, regardless of the method, the probability is 1/3.

**Final Answer**
The probability that chords AB and CD intersect is \boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}.
</think>

To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can analyze the relative positions of these points.

1. **Fixing a Point**: Fix point \(A\) on the circle. The positions of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are then random and uniformly distributed around the circumference.
2. **Orderings of Points**: The key is to determine the order of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) relative to \(A\). There are \(3! = 6\) possible orderings of these three points.
3. **Intersection Condition**: Chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(C\) and \(D\) are on different arcs determined by \(AB\). This happens when the points are arranged in an alternating order around the circle.
4. **Counting Valid Orderings**: Out of the 6 possible orderings, only 2 result in intersecting chords. These are the orderings where \(C\) and \(D\) alternate with \(B\) relative to \(A\).
5. **Probability Calculation**: The probability is the number of valid orderings divided by the total number of orderings, which is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the probability that chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\dfrac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"Okay, so I have this geometry problem here with two circles, both centered at point D. The radii are 1 and 2 units. The overlapping shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. I need to find the measure of the smaller angle ADC. Hmm, let me try to visualize this.

First, let me sketch the diagram in my mind. There are two concentric circles with the same center D. The smaller circle has a radius of 1, and the larger one has a radius of 2. The shaded area is the overlapping region, which I think is the area common to both circles. But wait, if they are concentric, the overlapping area would just be the area of the smaller circle, right? But the problem says the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area. That doesn't make sense if they are concentric because the smaller circle's area is π(1)^2 = π, and the larger is π(2)^2 = 4π. So 5/12 of 4π is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π, which is larger than the smaller circle's area. That can't be. So maybe the circles aren't concentric? Wait, the problem says both have center D, so they must be concentric. Hmm, maybe I'm misunderstanding the shaded area.

Wait, perhaps the shaded area isn't the overlapping region but some other region. Maybe it's a segment or a sector? The problem says ""skupna površina senčenega območja je 5/12 površine večjega kroga."" Translating that, it means the total shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. So maybe the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle? Or perhaps it's a lens-shaped area formed by the intersection of the two circles?

Wait, but if they are concentric, the intersection is just the smaller circle. So maybe the shaded area is a segment of the larger circle that's outside the smaller circle? That would make sense because then the area would be part of the larger circle not overlapping with the smaller one. But the problem says ""skupna površina senčenega območja,"" which translates to ""the total shaded area."" Maybe it's referring to a specific region, like a sector or something.

Wait, maybe the circles are not concentric? The problem says ""oba s središčem D,"" which means both have center D. So they must be concentric. Hmm, this is confusing. If they are concentric, the overlapping area is just the smaller circle. But 5/12 of the larger circle's area is (5/12)*π*(2)^2 = (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. The area of the smaller circle is π*(1)^2 = π. So 5/3 π is larger than π, which is impossible because the smaller circle can't have a larger area than itself. So maybe the shaded area is not the overlapping part but something else.

Wait, perhaps the shaded area is a segment of the larger circle that's outside the smaller circle. So the area would be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle, minus the area of the smaller circle's segment? Hmm, this is getting complicated.

Alternatively, maybe the two circles intersect each other, but both have the same center D. Wait, if they have the same center, they can't intersect unless one is entirely within the other. Since the smaller circle has radius 1 and the larger has radius 2, the smaller is entirely within the larger. So the overlapping area is just the smaller circle. But as I calculated before, that area is π, which is 1/4 of the larger circle's area (since 4π is the area of the larger circle). But the problem says the shaded area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is more than 1/4. So that can't be.

Wait, maybe the shaded area is not the overlapping part but a specific region. Maybe it's a sector of the larger circle that's outside the smaller circle. So the area would be the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. That could make sense.

Let me denote the angle at D as θ (theta). The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle θ is (θ/2π) * π*(2)^2 = (θ/2π)*4π = 2θ. Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle with the same angle θ is (θ/2π)*π*(1)^2 = (θ/2π)*π = θ/2. So the area of the shaded region, which is the difference between these two sectors, would be 2θ - θ/2 = (3θ)/2.

According to the problem, this shaded area is 5/12 of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is 4π, so 5/12 of that is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So we have:

(3θ)/2 = (5/3)π

Solving for θ:

Multiply both sides by 2: 3θ = (10/3)π

Divide both sides by 3: θ = (10/9)π radians.

But the problem asks for the measure in degrees. So converting radians to degrees:

θ = (10/9)π * (180/π) = (10/9)*180 = 200 degrees.

Wait, but the problem mentions ""manjši kot ADC,"" which is the smaller angle ADC. So if θ is 200 degrees, the smaller angle would be 360 - 200 = 160 degrees? Wait, no, because in a circle, the angle can't be more than 180 degrees if we're talking about the smaller angle. Wait, no, actually, in a circle, the smaller angle between two points is the smaller of the two possible angles, which would be less than or equal to 180 degrees.

Wait, but in this case, the angle θ is the central angle for the sector. If θ is 200 degrees, that's a reflex angle, and the smaller angle would be 160 degrees. But wait, let me think again.

Wait, if the shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle, and that area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, then θ is the angle of those sectors. So if θ is 200 degrees, that's the angle of the sector. But the problem is asking for the measure of the smaller angle ADC. So maybe ADC is the angle at D between two points on the circles, but I'm not sure.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in assuming the shaded area is the difference between the two sectors. Maybe it's the area of the segment of the larger circle minus the segment of the smaller circle. Let me think.

The area of a segment is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle. So for the larger circle, the area of the segment would be (θ/2π)*π*(2)^2 - (1/2)*(2)^2*sinθ = 2θ - 2 sinθ. Similarly, for the smaller circle, the area of the segment would be (θ/2π)*π*(1)^2 - (1/2)*(1)^2*sinθ = θ/2 - (1/2) sinθ. So the shaded area would be the difference between these two segments: [2θ - 2 sinθ] - [θ/2 - (1/2) sinθ] = 2θ - 2 sinθ - θ/2 + (1/2) sinθ = (3θ/2) - (3/2) sinθ.

According to the problem, this area is 5/12 of the larger circle's area, which is (5/12)*4π = (5/3)π. So:

(3θ/2) - (3/2) sinθ = (5/3)π

Hmm, this is a more complicated equation. Let me write it as:

(3/2)(θ - sinθ) = (5/3)π

Multiply both sides by 2/3:

θ - sinθ = (10/9)π

This is a transcendental equation and might not have an algebraic solution. Maybe I need to solve it numerically.

Let me denote f(θ) = θ - sinθ - (10/9)π. I need to find θ such that f(θ) = 0.

Let me try θ = 2π/3 (120 degrees):

f(2π/3) = 2π/3 - sin(2π/3) - (10/9)π ≈ 2.0944 - 0.8660 - 3.4979 ≈ -2.2695

Negative, so need a larger θ.

Try θ = 5π/6 (150 degrees):

f(5π/6) = 5π/6 - sin(5π/6) - (10/9)π ≈ 2.61799 - 0.5 - 3.4979 ≈ -1.38

Still negative.

Try θ = π (180 degrees):

f(π) = π - 0 - (10/9)π ≈ 3.1416 - 3.4979 ≈ -0.3563

Still negative.

Try θ = 7π/6 (210 degrees):

f(7π/6) = 7π/6 - sin(7π/6) - (10/9)π ≈ 3.6652 - (-0.5) - 3.4979 ≈ 3.6652 + 0.5 - 3.4979 ≈ 0.6673

Positive. So the root is between π and 7π/6.

Let me try θ = 3π/2 (270 degrees):

f(3π/2) = 3π/2 - sin(3π/2) - (10/9)π ≈ 4.7124 - (-1) - 3.4979 ≈ 4.7124 +1 -3.4979 ≈ 2.2145

Still positive.

Wait, but we need θ between π and 7π/6 where f(θ) crosses zero from negative to positive.

Wait, at θ = π, f(θ) ≈ -0.3563

At θ = 7π/6 ≈ 3.6652, f(θ) ≈ 0.6673

So let's try θ = 3.5 radians (approx 200 degrees):

f(3.5) = 3.5 - sin(3.5) - (10/9)π ≈ 3.5 - (-0.3508) - 3.4979 ≈ 3.5 + 0.3508 - 3.4979 ≈ 0.3529

Still positive.

Try θ = 3.4 radians (approx 194.8 degrees):

f(3.4) = 3.4 - sin(3.4) - (10/9)π ≈ 3.4 - (-0.2655) - 3.4979 ≈ 3.4 + 0.2655 - 3.4979 ≈ 0.1676

Still positive.

Try θ = 3.3 radians (approx 189 degrees):

f(3.3) = 3.3 - sin(3.3) - (10/9)π ≈ 3.3 - (-0.1699) - 3.4979 ≈ 3.3 + 0.1699 - 3.4979 ≈ -0.028

Almost zero. So between 3.3 and 3.4 radians.

Let me try θ = 3.35 radians:

f(3.35) = 3.35 - sin(3.35) - (10/9)π ≈ 3.35 - (-0.1987) - 3.4979 ≈ 3.35 + 0.1987 - 3.4979 ≈ 0.0508

Positive.

θ = 3.325 radians:

f(3.325) ≈ 3.325 - sin(3.325) - 3.4979

sin(3.325) ≈ sin(3.325) ≈ -0.1543

So f ≈ 3.325 - (-0.1543) - 3.4979 ≈ 3.325 + 0.1543 - 3.4979 ≈ -0.0186

Negative.

So between 3.325 and 3.35 radians.

Let me use linear approximation.

At θ1 = 3.325, f1 ≈ -0.0186

At θ2 = 3.35, f2 ≈ 0.0508

The difference in θ is 0.025 radians, and the difference in f is 0.0508 - (-0.0186) = 0.0694

We need to find θ where f(θ) = 0.

The fraction needed is 0.0186 / 0.0694 ≈ 0.268

So θ ≈ 3.325 + 0.268*0.025 ≈ 3.325 + 0.0067 ≈ 3.3317 radians

Convert 3.3317 radians to degrees: 3.3317 * (180/π) ≈ 3.3317 * 57.2958 ≈ 190.8 degrees

So θ ≈ 190.","[190, '190']",120,"[120, '120']",False

1. **Prostornina cilindričnega vrča:**

   Formula za prostornino cilindra je:
   \[
   V_{\text{vrč}} = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   Kjer je:
   - \( r = 3 \, \text{cm} \) (polmer vrča)
   - \( h = 8 \, \text{cm} \) (visina vrča)

   Vstavimo vrednosti:
   \[
   V_{\text{vrč}} = \pi \times 3^2 \times 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

2. **Prostornina sferičnega rezervoarja:**

   Formula za prostornino sfere je:
   \[
   V_{\text{rezervoar}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3
   \]
   Kjer je:
   - \( R = 6 \, \text{cm} \) (polmer rezervoarja)

   Vstavimo vrednosti:
   \[
   V_{\text{rezervoar}} = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times 6^3 = \frac{4}{3}\pi \times 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3
   \]

3. **Izračun števila potrebnih vrčev:**

   Število vrčev \( n \) je enako razmerju prostornin:
   \[
   n = \frac{V_{\text{rezervoar}}}{V_{\text{vrč}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = 4

"Okay, so I have this problem to solve: I need to compute the product of two sine functions. The expression is sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) multiplied by sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4). Hmm, that looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, let me recall some trigonometric identities that might help here. I remember that there are formulas for sin(A + B) and sin(A - B). Maybe I can use those to expand the expressions inside the sine functions. Let me write them down:

sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B

sin(A - B) = sin A cos B - cos A sin B

So, if I let A = arcsin 0.4 and B = arcsin 0.5, then the expression becomes sin(A + B) * sin(A - B). That seems manageable.

But wait, actually, in the problem, it's sin(arcsin 0.4 + arcsin 0.5) and sin(arcsin 0.5 - arcsin 0.4). So, actually, the first term is sin(A + B) where A is arcsin 0.4 and B is arcsin 0.5, and the second term is sin(B - A) because it's arcsin 0.5 minus arcsin 0.4. So, actually, it's sin(A + B) * sin(B - A). Hmm, that might be useful.

Alternatively, maybe I can use another identity. I remember that sin C * sin D can be expressed using the product-to-sum formulas. Let me recall that:

sin C * sin D = [cos(C - D) - cos(C + D)] / 2

So, if I let C = A + B and D = B - A, then:

sin(A + B) * sin(B - A) = [cos((A + B) - (B - A)) - cos((A + B) + (B - A))] / 2

Simplify the arguments inside the cosines:

First term: (A + B) - (B - A) = A + B - B + A = 2A

Second term: (A + B) + (B - A) = A + B + B - A = 2B

So, the expression becomes [cos(2A) - cos(2B)] / 2

That's interesting. So, instead of dealing with the product of two sine terms, I can express it in terms of cosines of double angles. Maybe that's easier to compute.

But before I proceed, let me make sure I didn't make a mistake in the substitution. So, C = A + B and D = B - A, so sin C * sin D = [cos(C - D) - cos(C + D)] / 2. Plugging in, C - D = (A + B) - (B - A) = 2A, and C + D = (A + B) + (B - A) = 2B. So, yes, that seems correct.

So, now I have [cos(2A) - cos(2B)] / 2. Now, I need to compute cos(2A) and cos(2B). Since A = arcsin 0.4 and B = arcsin 0.5, I can use the double-angle formula for cosine in terms of sine.

I remember that cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin²θ. Alternatively, it can also be written as 2 cos²θ - 1, but since I know sin θ, the first form might be more useful here.

So, let's compute cos(2A):

cos(2A) = 1 - 2 sin²A

But A = arcsin 0.4, so sin A = 0.4. Therefore,

cos(2A) = 1 - 2*(0.4)² = 1 - 2*(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68

Similarly, compute cos(2B):

cos(2B) = 1 - 2 sin²B

B = arcsin 0.5, so sin B = 0.5. Therefore,

cos(2B) = 1 - 2*(0.5)² = 1 - 2*(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5

So, plugging these back into the expression:

[cos(2A) - cos(2B)] / 2 = (0.68 - 0.5) / 2 = (0.18) / 2 = 0.09

So, the value of the original expression is 0.09.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I used the product-to-sum identity correctly: sin C sin D = [cos(C - D) - cos(C + D)] / 2. That seems right.

2. Substituted C = A + B and D = B - A, which led to cos(2A) - cos(2B). That seems correct.

3. Then, I used the double-angle formula for cosine in terms of sine: cos(2θ) = 1 - 2 sin²θ. That's correct.

4. Calculated cos(2A) as 1 - 2*(0.4)^2 = 0.68. Let me verify: 0.4 squared is 0.16, times 2 is 0.32, subtracted from 1 is 0.68. Correct.

5. Calculated cos(2B) as 1 - 2*(0.5)^2 = 0.5. 0.5 squared is 0.25, times 2 is 0.5, subtracted from 1 is 0.5. Correct.

6. Then, subtracted 0.5 from 0.68 to get 0.18, divided by 2 is 0.09. That seems right.

Alternatively, maybe I can approach this problem differently to confirm the result. Let me try another method.

Let me denote α = arcsin 0.4 and β = arcsin 0.5. So, the expression is sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). Let me compute sin(α + β) and sin(β - α) separately.

First, compute sin(α + β):

sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β

Similarly, sin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α

So, multiplying these two:

[sin α cos β + cos α sin β] * [sin β cos α - cos β sin α]

Let me expand this product:

= sin α cos β * sin β cos α - sin α cos β * cos β sin α + cos α sin β * sin β cos α - cos α sin β * cos β sin α

Hmm, that's a bit messy, but let's compute each term step by step.

First term: sin α cos β * sin β cos α = sin α sin β cos α cos β

Second term: - sin α cos β * cos β sin α = - sin²α cos²β

Third term: cos α sin β * sin β cos α = sin²β cos²α

Fourth term: - cos α sin β * cos β sin α = - sin α sin β cos α cos β

So, combining all four terms:

= sin α sin β cos α cos β - sin²α cos²β + sin²β cos²α - sin α sin β cos α cos β

Notice that the first and fourth terms cancel each other out:

sin α sin β cos α cos β - sin α sin β cos α cos β = 0

So, we're left with:

- sin²α cos²β + sin²β cos²α

Factor this expression:

= sin²β cos²α - sin²α cos²β

Hmm, that's the same as:

= (sin β cos α)^2 - (sin α cos β)^2

Which is a difference of squares, so it can be factored as:

= (sin β cos α - sin α cos β)(sin β cos α + sin α cos β)

Wait, but that's interesting because sin β cos α - sin α cos β is sin(β - α), and sin β cos α + sin α cos β is sin(β + α). So, we have:

= sin(β - α) * sin(β + α)

But that's exactly the original expression we started with: sin(α + β) * sin(β - α). So, this approach just brings us back to the same expression, which doesn't help much. Maybe I need to compute the numerical values instead.

Alternatively, perhaps I can compute sin(α + β) and sin(β - α) separately and then multiply them.

Given that α = arcsin 0.4 and β = arcsin 0.5, let's find sin α, cos α, sin β, and cos β.

We know that sin α = 0.4, so cos α = sqrt(1 - sin²α) = sqrt(1 - 0.16) = sqrt(0.84). Let me compute sqrt(0.84). Hmm, 0.84 is 84/100, which is 21/25. So sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5 ≈ 4.5837/5 ≈ 0.9165. Wait, actually, sqrt(21) is approximately 4.5837, so sqrt(21)/5 is approximately 0.9165. So, cos α ≈ 0.9165.

Similarly, sin β = 0.5, so cos β = sqrt(1 - sin²β) = sqrt(1 - 0.25) = sqrt(0.75) = sqrt(3)/2 ≈ 0.8660.

So, now, let's compute sin(α + β):

sin(α + β) = sin α cos β + cos α sin β

= 0.4 * 0.8660 + 0.9165 * 0.5

Compute each term:

0.4 * 0.8660 ≈ 0.3464

0.9165 * 0.5 ≈ 0.45825

Adding them together: 0.3464 + 0.45825 ≈ 0.80465

Similarly, compute sin(β - α):

sin(β - α) = sin β cos α - cos β sin α

= 0.5 * 0.9165 - 0.8660 * 0.4

Compute each term:

0.5 * 0.9165 ≈ 0.45825

0.8660 * 0.4 ≈ 0.3464

Subtracting: 0.45825 - 0.3464 ≈ 0.11185

Now, multiply sin(α + β) and sin(β - α):

0.80465 * 0.11185 ≈ Let's compute this.

First, 0.8 * 0.11185 ≈ 0.08948

Then, 0.00465 * 0.11185 ≈ approximately 0.000521

Adding them together: ≈ 0.08948 + 0.000521 ≈ 0.090001

So, approximately 0.09. That's consistent with the previous result.

Therefore, both methods give me the same answer, 0.09. So, I can be confident that the result is correct.

Alternatively, another way to think about this is to recognize that the product sin(A + B) * sin(B - A) can be expressed as [cos(2A) - cos(2B)] / 2, which we did earlier, and that gave us 0.09 as well.

So, all methods converge to the same result, which is 0.09. Therefore, I think the answer is 0.09.

**Final Answer**
\boxed{0.09}

To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we can use trigonometric identities and properties of inverse sine functions.

First, let \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\). We need to compute \(\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(B - A)\).

Using the product-to-sum identity:
\[
\sin C \cdot \sin D = \frac{\cos(C - D) - \cos(C + D)}{2}
\]
where \(C = A + B\) and \(D = B - A\), we get:
\[
\sin(A + B) \cdot \sin(B - A) = \frac{\cos((A + B) - (B - A)) - \cos((A + B) + (B - A))}{2}
\]
Simplifying the arguments inside the cosines:
\[
\cos(2A) - \cos(2B)
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\cos(2A) - \cos(2B)}{2}
\]

Next, we compute \(\cos(2A)\) and \(\cos(2B)\) using the double-angle formula \(\cos(2\theta) = 1 - 2\sin^2\theta\).

For \(A = \arcsin 0.4\):
\[
\cos(2A) = 1 - 2(0.4)^2 = 1 - 2(0.16) = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68
\]

For \(B = \arcsin 0.5\):
\[
\cos(2B) = 1 - 2(0.5)^2 = 1 - 2(0.25) = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5
\]

Substituting these values back into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos(2A) - \cos(2B)}{2} = \frac{0.68 - 0.5}{2} = \frac{0.18}{2} = 0.","[0.0900000000000000, '0.09']",\frac{9}{100},"[9/100, '\\frac{9}{100}']",True

To eliminate the cube root, I'll cube both sides of the equation. This gives me:

Calculating \(16^3\) results in 4096, so the equation becomes:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of the product of four cosine terms: cos(2π/15), cos(4π/15), cos(8π/15), and cos(16π/15). Hmm, that seems a bit complicated at first glance, but maybe I can break it down step by step.

First, I remember that sometimes products of cosines can be simplified using trigonometric identities. I think there's a product-to-sum formula, but I'm not sure if that's the best approach here. Alternatively, maybe I can use some multiple-angle formulas or properties of roots of unity. Let me think about that.

Wait, 15 is the denominator in all these angles. So, 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, and 16π/15. I notice that each angle is double the previous one: 2π/15, then 4π/15 (which is 2*(2π/15)), then 8π/15 (which is 2*(4π/15)), and 16π/15 (which is 2*(8π/15)). So, each term is the cosine of an angle that's double the previous angle. That seems like a geometric progression in the angles.

I remember that when dealing with products of cosines where each angle is double the previous, there might be a telescoping product or some identity that can help simplify this. Let me recall if there's a specific formula for such products.

I think there's a formula for the product of cosines where each angle is a multiple of the previous one. Maybe something like cos(θ)cos(2θ)cos(4θ)...cos(2^{n}θ). I think that product can be expressed in terms of sine functions. Let me try to recall the exact formula.

Yes, I think the formula is:

cos(θ)cos(2θ)cos(4θ)...cos(2^{n}θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ) / (2^{n+1} sinθ)

Is that right? Let me test it with a small n. Let's take n=1: cosθ cos2θ. According to the formula, it should be sin(4θ)/(4 sinθ). Let me compute both sides.

Left side: cosθ cos2θ. Right side: sin4θ/(4 sinθ). Let's compute sin4θ/(4 sinθ). Using the identity sin4θ = 2 sin2θ cos2θ = 2*(2 sinθ cosθ) cos2θ = 4 sinθ cosθ cos2θ. So, sin4θ/(4 sinθ) = (4 sinθ cosθ cos2θ)/(4 sinθ) = cosθ cos2θ. Yes, that works. So the formula seems correct for n=1.

Similarly, for n=2: cosθ cos2θ cos4θ. According to the formula, it should be sin8θ/(8 sinθ). Let's check:

sin8θ = 2 sin4θ cos4θ = 2*(2 sin2θ cos2θ) cos4θ = 4 sin2θ cos2θ cos4θ = 4*(2 sinθ cosθ) cos2θ cos4θ = 8 sinθ cosθ cos2θ cos4θ. So, sin8θ/(8 sinθ) = (8 sinθ cosθ cos2θ cos4θ)/(8 sinθ) = cosθ cos2θ cos4θ. Perfect, the formula holds.

So, in general, the product cosθ cos2θ cos4θ...cos(2^{n}θ) equals sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ). That seems solid.

In our problem, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15. So, starting from θ = 2π/15, and each subsequent term is double the previous angle. So, n=3 because we have four terms: θ, 2θ, 4θ, 8θ. Wait, 2^3θ is 8θ, which is 16π/15. So, n=3.

Therefore, applying the formula, the product should be sin(2^{4}θ)/(2^{4} sinθ). Let's compute that.

First, θ = 2π/15. So, 2^{4}θ = 16θ = 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15. So, sin(32π/15). Let's compute that.

But 32π/15 is more than 2π, so let's subtract 2π to find the equivalent angle. 32π/15 - 2π = 32π/15 - 30π/15 = 2π/15. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). Because sine has a period of 2π, so sin(θ + 2π) = sinθ.

Therefore, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the numerator is sin(2π/15). The denominator is 2^{4} sinθ = 16 sin(2π/15). So, putting it all together, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. So, the product of these four cosines is 1/16? Let me verify that.

Wait, hold on. Let me double-check the formula. The formula is for the product cosθ cos2θ cos4θ...cos(2^{n}θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ). So, in our case, n=3, so 2^{4}θ = 16θ, which is 32π/15, which is equivalent to 2π/15 as I found earlier. So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the numerator is sin(2π/15), denominator is 16 sin(2π/15). So, the ratio is 1/16.

Therefore, the product is 1/16. Hmm, that seems correct. But let me think again because sometimes when dealing with multiple angles, especially beyond 2π, there might be a sign change or something else.

Wait, 32π/15 is equal to 2π + 2π/15, right? So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π + 2π/15) = sin(2π/15) because sine is 2π periodic. So, yes, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the numerator is sin(2π/15), denominator is 16 sin(2π/15). So, they cancel out, leaving 1/16.

Therefore, the product is 1/16. Hmm, that seems too simple, but I think it's correct.

Wait, but let me compute the product numerically to check. Let me compute each cosine term numerically and multiply them together.

Compute cos(2π/15):

2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians. cos(0.418879) ≈ 0.913545.

cos(4π/15) ≈ cos(0.837758) ≈ 0.669131.

cos(8π/15) ≈ cos(1.675516) ≈ -0.207912.

cos(16π/15) ≈ cos(3.351032) ≈ -0.978148.

Now, multiply them together:

0.913545 * 0.669131 ≈ 0.61185.

0.61185 * (-0.207912) ≈ -0.1271.

-0.1271 * (-0.978148) ≈ 0.1242.

Hmm, 0.1242 is approximately 1/8, but 1/16 is 0.0625. Wait, that's not matching. So, my earlier conclusion must be wrong.

Wait, that's a problem. So, according to the formula, the product is 1/16 ≈ 0.0625, but when I compute numerically, I get approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8. So, something is wrong here.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in applying the formula. Let me check again.

The formula is:

Product from k=0 to n of cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ).

In our case, the product is cos(2π/15) * cos(4π/15) * cos(8π/15) * cos(16π/15). So, starting from θ = 2π/15, and multiplying up to 2^3 θ = 16π/15. So, n=3.

Therefore, the product should be sin(2^{4}θ)/(2^{4} sinθ) = sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). Wait, 16θ is 16*(2π/15) = 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the numerator is sin(2π/15), denominator is 16 sin(2π/15). So, the product is 1/16.

But when I compute numerically, I get approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8, not 1/16. So, there must be a mistake in my reasoning.

Wait, perhaps the formula is for the product up to cos(2^{n}θ), but in our case, the angles are 2π/15, 4π/15, 8π/15, 16π/15, which is four terms, so n=3. So, the formula should apply.

But wait, let me compute sin(2π/15) numerically. 2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians. sin(0.418879) ≈ 0.406737.

So, according to the formula, the product is sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16 ≈ 0.0625.

But when I compute the product numerically, I get approximately 0.1242, which is roughly double that. So, perhaps I missed a factor somewhere.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe the formula is for the product starting from k=0 to n, which would be cosθ cos2θ cos4θ...cos(2^n θ). So, in our case, starting from θ=2π/15, and n=3, so the product is cos(2π/15) cos(4π/15) cos(8π/15) cos(16π/15). So, that's four terms, which is correct.

But according to the formula, it's sin(2^{4}θ)/(2^{4} sinθ). So, sin(32π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = sin(2π/15)/(16 sin(2π/15)) = 1/16.

But when I compute the product numerically, I get approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8. So, perhaps the formula is incorrect, or I'm misapplying it.

Wait, let me check the formula again. Maybe I misremembered it. Let me look it up in my mind. I think the formula is:

Product_{k=0}^{n} cos(2^k θ) = sin(2^{n+1}θ)/(2^{n+1} sinθ).

Yes, that's what I thought. So, for n=3, it's sin(16θ)/(16 sinθ). So, 16θ is 32π/15, which is 2π + 2π/15, so sin(32π/15) = sin(2π/15). So, the numerator is sin(2π/15), denominator is 16 sin(2π/15). So, 1/16.

But why is the numerical calculation giving me approximately 0.1242, which is roughly 1/8? Hmm.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in the numerical calculation. Let me recalculate the product step by step.

Compute each cosine:

cos(2π/15): 2π ≈ 6.28319, so 2π/15 ≈ 0.418879 radians. cos(0.418879) ≈ 0.913545.

cos(4π/15): 4π/15 ≈ 0.837758 radians. cos(0.837758) ≈ 0.669131.

cos(8π/15): 8π/15 ≈ 1.675516 radians. cos(1.675516) ≈ -0.207912.

cos(16π/15): 16π/15 ≈ 3.351032 radians. cos(3.351032) ≈ -0.978148.

Now, multiply them step by step:

First, 0.913545 * 0.669131 ≈ 0.913545 * 0.669131 ≈ Let's compute 0.9 * 0.669 ≈ 0.","[0, '0']",\frac{1}{16},"[1/16, '\\frac{1}{16}']",False
"Okay, so I have this problem about an isosceles triangle ABC where AB equals AC, and the height AM is 11 units. There's a point D on AM such that AD is 10 units, and the angle BDC is three times the angle BAC. I need to find the perimeter of triangle ABC.

First, let me try to visualize the problem. Since ABC is isosceles with AB = AC, the triangle is symmetric about the altitude AM. So, point M is the midpoint of BC, and AM is perpendicular to BC. The height AM is 11, so the length from A to M is 11 units. Point D is somewhere on AM, 10 units away from A, which means it's 1 unit away from M because AM is 11 units long.

So, AD = 10, DM = 1. Now, the angle at D, which is angle BDC, is three times the angle at A, which is angle BAC. Let me denote angle BAC as θ, so angle BDC is 3θ.

I think I can use some trigonometric relationships here. Maybe the Law of Sines or Cosines in triangles ABD, ADC, or BDC. Let me see.

Since ABC is isosceles, angles at B and C are equal. Let me denote angle ABC and angle ACB as α each. Then, since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, we have θ + 2α = 180°, so α = (180° - θ)/2.

But angle BDC is 3θ. Hmm, maybe I can relate this angle to other angles in the triangle.

Let me consider triangle BDC. In triangle BDC, angle at D is 3θ, and sides BD, DC, and BC are involved. Maybe I can express BD and DC in terms of the sides of ABC.

Wait, ABC is isosceles with AB = AC. Let me denote AB = AC = x, and BC = y. Then, since AM is the altitude, it splits BC into two equal parts, so BM = MC = y/2.

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle ABM, we have AB² = AM² + BM², so x² = 11² + (y/2)². That gives x² = 121 + y²/4.

So, if I can find y, I can find x, and then the perimeter will be 2x + y.

Now, how do I relate this to point D? Point D is on AM, 10 units from A, so it's 1 unit from M. So, coordinates might help here. Maybe I can assign coordinates to the points and use coordinate geometry.

Let me place point A at (0, 11), M at (0, 0), so point D is at (0, 1). Then, since ABC is isosceles with base BC, points B and C will be at (-y/2, 0) and (y/2, 0) respectively.

So, coordinates:
- A: (0, 11)
- M: (0, 0)
- D: (0, 1)
- B: (-y/2, 0)
- C: (y/2, 0)

Now, I need to find angle BDC, which is the angle at D between points B, D, and C. So, angle BDC is the angle between lines DB and DC.

To find angle BDC, I can use vectors or coordinate geometry. Let me compute vectors DB and DC.

Point D is at (0,1). Point B is at (-y/2, 0). So vector DB is B - D = (-y/2 - 0, 0 - 1) = (-y/2, -1).

Similarly, vector DC is C - D = (y/2 - 0, 0 - 1) = (y/2, -1).

The angle between vectors DB and DC is angle BDC, which is 3θ. So, using the dot product formula:

cos(angle BDC) = (DB · DC) / (|DB| |DC|)

Compute DB · DC: (-y/2)(y/2) + (-1)(-1) = (-y²/4) + 1

Compute |DB|: sqrt( ( -y/2 )² + (-1)² ) = sqrt( y²/4 + 1 )

Similarly, |DC| is the same as |DB|, so |DC| = sqrt( y²/4 + 1 )

Therefore, cos(angle BDC) = ( -y²/4 + 1 ) / ( y²/4 + 1 )

But angle BDC is 3θ, so cos(3θ) = (1 - y²/4) / (1 + y²/4 )

Now, I need to find θ, which is angle BAC. Let me find cosθ.

In triangle ABC, angle BAC is θ. Using the Law of Cosines:

cosθ = (AB² + AC² - BC²) / (2 AB * AC )

But AB = AC = x, so:

cosθ = (2x² - y²) / (2x² )

But from earlier, x² = 121 + y²/4, so substitute:

cosθ = (2*(121 + y²/4) - y²) / (2*(121 + y²/4))

Simplify numerator:

2*121 + 2*(y²/4) - y² = 242 + y²/2 - y² = 242 - y²/2

Denominator:

2*(121 + y²/4) = 242 + y²/2

So, cosθ = (242 - y²/2) / (242 + y²/2 )

Let me denote z = y²/2 for simplicity. Then, cosθ = (242 - z) / (242 + z )

Similarly, earlier, we had cos(3θ) = (1 - y²/4) / (1 + y²/4 )

But y²/4 is z/2, so cos(3θ) = (1 - z/2) / (1 + z/2 )

So, now we have expressions for cosθ and cos(3θ) in terms of z.

We know that angle BDC = 3θ, so cos(3θ) is equal to (1 - z/2)/(1 + z/2). Also, we can express cos(3θ) in terms of cosθ using the triple angle formula.

Recall that cos(3θ) = 4cos³θ - 3cosθ.

So, let me write:

4cos³θ - 3cosθ = (1 - z/2)/(1 + z/2 )

But cosθ is (242 - z)/(242 + z). Let me substitute that in.

So,

4[(242 - z)/(242 + z)]³ - 3[(242 - z)/(242 + z)] = (1 - z/2)/(1 + z/2 )

This seems complicated, but maybe we can let t = z to make it less messy.

Let me denote t = z, so:

4[(242 - t)/(242 + t)]³ - 3[(242 - t)/(242 + t)] = (1 - t/2)/(1 + t/2 )

Let me compute the left-hand side (LHS):

Let me denote u = (242 - t)/(242 + t). Then, LHS = 4u³ - 3u.

So, 4u³ - 3u = (1 - t/2)/(1 + t/2 )

But u = (242 - t)/(242 + t). Let me express t in terms of u.

From u = (242 - t)/(242 + t), cross-multiplying:

u*(242 + t) = 242 - t

242u + ut = 242 - t

Bring terms with t to one side:

ut + t = 242 - 242u

t(u + 1) = 242(1 - u)

So, t = [242(1 - u)] / (u + 1)

Now, substitute t into the right-hand side (RHS):

(1 - t/2)/(1 + t/2 ) = [1 - (242(1 - u))/(2(u + 1)) ] / [1 + (242(1 - u))/(2(u + 1)) ]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator:

1 - [242(1 - u)]/[2(u + 1)] = [2(u + 1) - 242(1 - u)] / [2(u + 1)]

Denominator:

1 + [242(1 - u)]/[2(u + 1)] = [2(u + 1) + 242(1 - u)] / [2(u + 1)]

So, RHS becomes:

[2(u + 1) - 242(1 - u)] / [2(u + 1) + 242(1 - u)]

Simplify numerator and denominator:

Numerator:

2u + 2 - 242 + 242u = (2u + 242u) + (2 - 242) = 244u - 240

Denominator:

2u + 2 + 242 - 242u = (2u - 242u) + (2 + 242) = (-240u) + 244

So, RHS = (244u - 240)/(-240u + 244) = (244u - 240)/(244 - 240u)

Factor numerator and denominator:

Numerator: 4*(61u - 60)

Denominator: 4*(61 - 60u)

So, RHS = (61u - 60)/(61 - 60u)

Therefore, we have:

4u³ - 3u = (61u - 60)/(61 - 60u)

Multiply both sides by (61 - 60u):

(4u³ - 3u)(61 - 60u) = 61u - 60

Let me expand the left-hand side:

First, multiply 4u³ by (61 - 60u):

4u³*61 = 244u³

4u³*(-60u) = -240u⁴

Then, multiply -3u by (61 - 60u):

-3u*61 = -183u

-3u*(-60u) = 180u²

So, altogether:

244u³ - 240u⁴ - 183u + 180u²

So, the equation becomes:

244u³ - 240u⁴ - 183u + 180u² = 61u - 60

Bring all terms to the left:

244u³ - 240u⁴ - 183u + 180u² - 61u + 60 = 0

Combine like terms:

-240u⁴ + 244u³ + 180u² - (183u + 61u) + 60 = 0

Simplify:

-240u⁴ + 244u³ + 180u² - 244u + 60 = 0

Let me write it as:

-240u⁴ + 244u³ + 180u² - 244u + 60 = 0

This is a quartic equation, which is quite complicated. Maybe I can factor it or find rational roots.

Let me factor out a common factor if possible. Let's see:

All coefficients are even except 244 and 244, which are divisible by 4. Let me check:

-240 is divisible by 4, 244 is divisible by 4, 180 is divisible by 4? 180/4=45, yes. 244/4=61, 60/4=15.

So, factor out 4:

4*(-60u⁴ + 61u³ + 45u² - 61u + 15) = 0

So, the equation reduces to:

-60u⁴ + 61u³ + 45u² - 61u + 15 = 0

Let me write it as:

60u⁴ - 61u³ - 45u² + 61u - 15 = 0

Now, let's try to find rational roots using Rational Root Theorem. Possible roots are factors of 15 over factors of 60, so ±1, ±3, ±5, ±15, ±1/2, etc.

Let me test u=1:

60(1)^4 -61(1)^3 -45(1)^2 +61(1) -15 = 60 -61 -45 +61 -15 = (60 -61) + (-45 +61) -15 = (-1) + 16 -15 = 0

Hey, u=1 is a root!

So, (u - 1) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or use synthetic division.

Divide 60u⁴ -61u³ -45u² +61u -15 by (u - 1).

Using synthetic division:

Coefficients: 60, -61, -45, 61, -15

Bring down 60.

Multiply by 1: 60

Add to next coefficient: -61 +60 = -1

Multiply by 1: -1

Add to next coefficient: -45 + (-1) = -46

Multiply by 1: -46

Add to next coefficient: 61 + (-46) = 15

Multiply by 1: 15

Add to last coefficient: -15 +15=0

So, the polynomial factors as (u -1)(60u³ - u² -4","[-4, '-4']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. Hmm, I need to find all real numbers x that satisfy this. Let me think about how to approach this.

First, I notice that the expression in the middle is x⁴ + 4x². That looks like a quadratic in terms of x². Maybe I can substitute y = x² to make it easier. Let me try that.

So, if y = x², then the inequality becomes -4 < y² + 4y < 21. Now, I have a quadratic inequality in terms of y. I can split this into two separate inequalities:

1. -4 < y² + 4y
2. y² + 4y < 21

Let me solve each part one by one.

Starting with the first inequality: -4 < y² + 4y.

I can rewrite this as y² + 4y + 4 > 0. Wait, how? Let me subtract -4 from both sides:

y² + 4y + 4 > 0.

Hmm, that's a quadratic expression. Let me factor it. y² + 4y + 4 is a perfect square, right? It factors to (y + 2)² > 0.

So, (y + 2)² > 0. Since a square is always non-negative, this inequality holds for all real y except when y + 2 = 0, which is y = -2. But y = x², and x² can't be negative, so y is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, y = -2 is not possible. So, the first inequality is always true for all real x because y is non-negative, and (y + 2)² is always positive.

Okay, so the first inequality doesn't restrict the values of x. Now, moving on to the second inequality: y² + 4y < 21.

Let me rewrite this as y² + 4y - 21 < 0. Now, I need to solve this quadratic inequality. First, I'll find the roots of the equation y² + 4y - 21 = 0.

Using the quadratic formula: y = [-b ± √(b² - 4ac)] / (2a). Here, a = 1, b = 4, c = -21.

So, discriminant D = 16 - 4*1*(-21) = 16 + 84 = 100. That's a perfect square, so the roots are:

y = [-4 ± √100]/2 = [-4 ± 10]/2.

Calculating the two roots:

First root: (-4 + 10)/2 = 6/2 = 3.

Second root: (-4 - 10)/2 = -14/2 = -7.

So, the quadratic can be factored as (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.

Now, to solve the inequality (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0, I can use a sign chart. The critical points are y = -7 and y = 3.

Since y = x², y must be greater than or equal to 0. So, y can't be less than 0. Therefore, the interval y < -7 is not possible because y is non-negative. So, we only consider y between -7 and 3, but since y can't be negative, the relevant interval is 0 ≤ y < 3.

So, y must be less than 3. Therefore, y < 3.

But y = x², so x² < 3. To find x, take square roots:

-√3 < x < √3.

So, combining both inequalities, the first one didn't restrict x, and the second one gives us x between -√3 and √3.

Wait, but let me double-check. The original inequality was -4 < x⁴ + 4x² < 21. I transformed it into two inequalities, solved them, and found that x must be between -√3 and √3.

But let me test a value in this interval to make sure. Let's pick x = 0. Then x⁴ + 4x² = 0 + 0 = 0, which is between -4 and 21. Good.

What about x = 1? x⁴ + 4x² = 1 + 4 = 5, which is also between -4 and 21.

What about x = √3? x⁴ + 4x² = ( (√3)^4 ) + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so x = √3 is not included. Similarly, x = -√3 gives the same result.

What about x = 2? x⁴ + 4x² = 16 + 16 = 32, which is greater than 21, so it's not included. That makes sense because 2 is outside our interval.

What about x = -2? Same result, 32, which is also excluded.

What about x = -1? x⁴ + 4x² = 1 + 4 = 5, which is fine.

What about x = 1.5? Let's calculate: (1.5)^4 = 5.0625, and 4*(1.5)^2 = 4*2.25 = 9. So total is 5.0625 + 9 = 14.0625, which is less than 21. So, 1.5 is okay.

Wait, but 1.5 is less than √3, which is approximately 1.732. So, 1.5 is within the interval.

What about x = √3 - 0.1, which is approximately 1.632. Let's compute x⁴ + 4x²:

x² ≈ (1.632)^2 ≈ 2.664

x⁴ ≈ (2.664)^2 ≈ 7.098

So, x⁴ + 4x² ≈ 7.098 + 10.656 ≈ 17.754, which is less than 21. So, that's fine.

What about x approaching √3 from below? As x approaches √3, x⁴ + 4x² approaches 21, but doesn't reach it. So, the interval is open at √3.

Similarly, for x approaching -√3 from above, same result.

What about x = 0? As before, it's 0, which is within the range.

What about x = 10? x⁴ + 4x² is way larger than 21, so it's excluded.

What about x = -10? Same as above.

What about x = -√3 + 0.1? Let's compute x²: ( -√3 + 0.1 )² ≈ (1.732 - 0.1)^2 ≈ (1.632)^2 ≈ 2.664. Then x⁴ ≈ 7.098, so total is 7.098 + 10.656 ≈ 17.754, which is still less than 21.

So, it seems that the interval is correct.

Wait, but let me think again about the first inequality. I had -4 < y² + 4y, which became (y + 2)^2 > 0. Since y is x², which is non-negative, y + 2 is always at least 2, so (y + 2)^2 is always greater than 0. So, the first inequality is always true, so the only restriction comes from the second inequality.

Therefore, the solution is x in (-√3, √3).

But let me write it in interval notation. So, the solution set is all real numbers x such that x is greater than -√3 and less than √3. In interval notation, that's (-√3, √3).

Wait, but let me confirm once more. Let me pick x = √3. Then x⁴ + 4x² = (√3)^4 + 4*(√3)^2 = 9 + 12 = 21. But the inequality is strict, so x = √3 is not included. Similarly, x = -√3 is not included. So, the interval is open at both ends.

Yes, that seems correct.

So, putting it all together, the solution is x in (-√3, √3).

**Final Answer**
The solution is \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.
</think>

To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we start by substituting \(y = x^2\). This transforms the inequality into \(-4 < y^2 + 4y < 21\).

First, consider the inequality \(-4 < y^2 + 4y\). Rewriting it, we get:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0 \]
which factors to:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0 \]
Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, this inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). Rewriting it, we get:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) using the quadratic formula, we find the roots:
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]
which gives \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic can be factored as:
\[ (y - 3)(y + 7) < 0 \]
Since \(y = x^2\) is non-negative, we only consider the interval \(0 \leq y < 3\). Thus, \(x^2 < 3\), leading to:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Therefore, the solution in interval notation is:
\[
\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) given three equations involving \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \). Let me write down the equations again to make sure I have them right:

1. \( xyz = 4 \)
2. \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \)
3. \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \)

Hmm, I need to find \( xy + yz + zx \). I remember that in problems involving symmetric sums, sometimes it's helpful to use identities or known formulas. Let me think about what I know.

First, I recall that \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Maybe that could be useful here since I have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \) and \( xyz \) given.

Let me compute \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz \). Plugging in the known values:

\( 4 - 3 \times 4 = 4 - 12 = -8 \).

So, \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = -8 \). According to the identity, this is equal to \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \). Let me denote \( S = x + y + z \), \( P = xy + yz + zx \), and \( Q = xyz = 4 \). Also, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \) can be expressed in terms of \( S \) and \( P \) as \( S^2 - 2P \).

So, substituting into the identity:

\( -8 = S \times ( (S^2 - 2P) - P ) = S(S^2 - 3P) \).

So, \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \). That's one equation involving \( S \) and \( P \).

Now, looking at the third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \). Hmm, this looks a bit complicated, but maybe I can factor it or express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \).

Let me try to factor the expression. Notice that each term is a product of two variables where one is squared. For example, \( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(y + x) \). Similarly, \( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(z + x) \), and \( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(z + y) \).

So, the entire expression can be written as:

\( xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \).

Which simplifies to:

\( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \).

Hmm, that's still a bit messy, but maybe I can factor it further or express it in terms of \( S \) and \( P \).

Let me expand each term:

\( xy(x + y) = x^2 y + xy^2 \),
\( xz(x + z) = x^2 z + xz^2 \),
\( yz(y + z) = y^2 z + yz^2 \).

So, when we add them all up, we get the original expression, which is 12. So, that doesn't help much. Maybe another approach.

Alternatively, I can factor the expression as:

\( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) \).

Wait, maybe I can factor out terms:

Let me group terms differently. Let's see:

\( xy^2 + x^2 y = xy(x + y) \),
\( xz^2 + x^2 z = xz(x + z) \),
\( yz^2 + y^2 z = yz(y + z) \).

So, the entire expression is \( xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) \).

Hmm, maybe I can factor this as \( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz \). Let me check:

\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x(xy + yz + zx) + y(xy + yz + zx) + z(xy + yz + zx) \)
= \( x^2 y + x y z + x^2 z + x y^2 + y^2 z + y z^2 + x z^2 + y z^2 + z^2 x \).

Wait, that seems more complicated. Let me compute it step by step:

\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = x(xy) + x(yz) + x(zx) + y(xy) + y(yz) + y(zx) + z(xy) + z(yz) + z(zx) \)
= \( x^2 y + x y z + x^2 z + x y^2 + y^2 z + y z x + x z y + y z^2 + z^2 x \).

Wait, that's actually:

\( x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y + 3xyz \).

So, \( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) = (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) + 3xyz \).

But our third equation is \( x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = 12 \). So, that means:

\( (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12 \).

So, substituting \( S \) and \( P \):

\( S \times P - 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

So, \( S P - 12 = 12 \), which simplifies to \( S P = 24 \).

So now, I have two equations:

1. \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \)
2. \( S P = 24 \)

So, I can use the second equation to express \( S \) in terms of \( P \): \( S = 24 / P \).

Substituting into the first equation:

\( (24 / P) \times ( (24 / P)^2 - 3P ) = -8 \).

Let me compute this step by step.

First, compute \( (24 / P)^2 \):

\( (24 / P)^2 = 576 / P^2 \).

Then, \( (24 / P)^2 - 3P = 576 / P^2 - 3P \).

So, the entire expression becomes:

\( (24 / P) \times (576 / P^2 - 3P) = -8 \).

Let me compute the multiplication:

First, multiply \( 24 / P \) with \( 576 / P^2 \):

\( (24 / P) \times (576 / P^2) = (24 \times 576) / P^3 = 13,824 / P^3 \).

Then, multiply \( 24 / P \) with \( -3P \):

\( (24 / P) \times (-3P) = -72 \).

So, putting it all together:

\( 13,824 / P^3 - 72 = -8 \).

Now, let's solve for \( P \):

\( 13,824 / P^3 - 72 = -8 \)

Add 72 to both sides:

\( 13,824 / P^3 = 64 \)

Multiply both sides by \( P^3 \):

\( 13,824 = 64 P^3 \)

Divide both sides by 64:

\( P^3 = 13,824 / 64 \)

Compute 13,824 ÷ 64:

Let me do this division step by step.

64 × 200 = 12,800

13,824 - 12,800 = 1,024

64 × 16 = 1,024

So, 200 + 16 = 216

Thus, \( P^3 = 216 \)

Therefore, \( P = \sqrt[3]{216} = 6 \).

So, \( P = xy + yz + zx = 6 \).

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the third equation, I expressed it as \( S P - 3 Q = 12 \), which with \( Q = 4 \) gives \( S P = 24 \). Then, using the identity for \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 \), I got \( S(S^2 - 3P) = -8 \). Substituting \( S = 24 / P \) into that equation led me to \( (24 / P)( (24 / P)^2 - 3P ) = -8 \). Expanding that, I got \( 13,824 / P^3 - 72 = -8 \), which simplifies to \( 13,824 / P^3 = 64 \), so \( P^3 = 216 \), hence \( P = 6 \).

That seems correct. Let me verify if \( P = 6 \) satisfies all the equations.

If \( P = 6 \), then \( S = 24 / 6 = 4 \).

So, \( S = 4 \), \( P = 6 \), \( Q = 4 \).

Now, let's check the first identity: \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \).

We have \( x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 \), \( 3xyz = 12 \), so \( 4 - 12 = -8 \).

On the other side, \( (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) \).

We know \( x + y + z = 4 \), and \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S^2 - 2P = 16 - 12 = 4 \).

So, \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx = 4 - 6 = -2 \).

Thus, \( 4 \times (-2) = -8 \), which matches. So that's correct.

Also, the third equation: \( xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12 \).

We expressed this as \( S P - 3 Q = 12 \). Plugging in \( S = 4 \), \( P = 6 \), \( Q = 4 \):

\( 4 \times 6 - 3 \times 4 = 24 - 12 = 12 \), which is correct.

So, all equations are satisfied with \( P = 6 \). Therefore, the value of \( xy + yz + zx \) is 6.

"Okay, so I have this inequality to solve: \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that when dealing with inequalities involving absolute values and rational expressions, I need to consider the critical points where the expression can change its sign. Also, I should be careful about the denominator because it can't be zero, and it affects the sign of the entire expression.

First, let me rewrite the inequality to make it clearer:

\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

I know that the absolute value in the numerator, \(|x^2 - 81|\), is always non-negative because absolute values can't be negative. So, the numerator is either zero or positive. The denominator, \(x^2 - 36x\), is a quadratic expression, and I can factor it to find its roots. Let me factor both the numerator and the denominator.

Starting with the numerator: \(|x^2 - 81|\). I recognize that \(x^2 - 81\) is a difference of squares, so it factors into \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). Therefore, the numerator becomes \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\). Since the absolute value is applied to the entire expression, it doesn't factor into separate absolute values unless I know the sign of each factor, which I don't yet. So, I'll keep it as \(|x^2 - 81|\) for now.

Now, the denominator: \(x^2 - 36x\). I can factor out an x, so it becomes \(x(x - 36)\). So, the denominator is \(x(x - 36)\). This means the denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). These are critical points because the expression is undefined at these points, and the sign of the denominator can change around these values.

So, the critical points for the entire expression are where the numerator is zero or where the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which is when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). So, my critical points are at \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into intervals. I need to test each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval. The intervals are:

1. \( (-\infty, -9) \)
2. \( (-9, 0) \)
3. \( (0, 9) \)
4. \( (9, 36) \)
5. \( (36, \infty) \)

I should also consider the critical points themselves. However, since the inequality is strict (i.e., less than zero, not less than or equal to), the points where the expression is zero or undefined won't be included in the solution.

Let me analyze each interval one by one.

**1. Interval \( (-\infty, -9) \):**

Pick a test point, say \(x = -10\).

Numerator: \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\). So, positive.

Denominator: \((-10)^2 - 36*(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460\). So, positive.

Therefore, the expression is \(\frac{19}{460}\), which is positive. Since we're looking for where the expression is less than zero, this interval doesn't satisfy the inequality.

**2. Interval \( (-9, 0) \):**

Let me choose \(x = -5\).

Numerator: \(|(-5)^2 - 81| = |25 - 81| = |-56| = 56\). Positive.

Denominator: \((-5)^2 - 36*(-5) = 25 + 180 = 205\). Positive.

So, the expression is \(\frac{56}{205}\), which is positive. Again, not less than zero. So, this interval isn't part of the solution.

**3. Interval \( (0, 9) \):**

Let me pick \(x = 1\).

Numerator: \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = |-80| = 80\). Positive.

Denominator: \(1^2 - 36*1 = 1 - 36 = -35\). Negative.

So, the expression is \(\frac{80}{-35}\), which is negative. Since we're looking for where the expression is less than zero, this interval is part of the solution.

**4. Interval \( (9, 36) \):**

Let me choose \(x = 10\).

Numerator: \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = |19| = 19\). Positive.

Denominator: \(10^2 - 36*10 = 100 - 360 = -260\). Negative.

So, the expression is \(\frac{19}{-260}\), which is negative. Therefore, this interval is also part of the solution.

**5. Interval \( (36, \infty) \):**

Let me pick \(x = 40\).

Numerator: \(|40^2 - 81| = |1600 - 81| = |1519| = 1519\). Positive.

Denominator: \(40^2 - 36*40 = 1600 - 1440 = 160\). Positive.

So, the expression is \(\frac{1519}{160}\), which is positive. Not less than zero, so this interval isn't part of the solution.

Now, let me summarize the results:

- The expression is positive in intervals \( (-\infty, -9) \), \( (-9, 0) \), and \( (36, \infty) \).
- The expression is negative in intervals \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \).
- The expression is zero at \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), but since the inequality is strict, these points aren't included.
- The expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so these points are excluded as well.

Therefore, the solution set is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative, which are \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \). But wait, I should check if there's any overlap or if I need to consider the point at \(x = 9\). Since at \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, making the entire expression zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, \(x = 9\) is excluded.

But hold on, I should also consider the behavior around \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Since the expression is undefined at these points, they are not included in the solution.

Wait, but let me double-check the interval \( (0, 9) \). When I tested \(x = 1\), the expression was negative. What about when \(x\) approaches 0 from the right? The denominator approaches 0 from the negative side because \(x^2 - 36x\) near 0 is approximately \(-36x\), which is negative when \(x\) is positive. The numerator approaches \(|0 - 81| = 81\), which is positive. So, near 0, the expression is negative, which is consistent with my earlier result.

Similarly, near \(x = 36\), the denominator approaches 0 from the positive side because \(x^2 - 36x\) near 36 is approximately \(36^2 - 36*36 = 0\), but for \(x\) slightly larger than 36, it's positive. The numerator is positive, so the expression is positive near 36 from the right, which is consistent with my earlier result.

Wait, but in the interval \( (9, 36) \), the denominator is negative because \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). For \(x\) between 9 and 36, \(x\) is positive, but \(x - 36\) is negative, so the denominator is negative. The numerator is positive, so the expression is negative. That's correct.

But hold on, let me think about the numerator again. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\). So, when \(x^2 - 81\) is positive, the absolute value doesn't change it, and when it's negative, the absolute value makes it positive. So, the numerator is always positive except when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which is at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

Therefore, the sign of the entire expression is determined solely by the denominator because the numerator is always positive (except at the zeros, which we've already considered). So, the expression is negative when the denominator is negative, which is when \(x(x - 36) < 0\).

So, solving \(x(x - 36) < 0\). Let's solve this inequality.

The critical points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). The intervals are:

1. \( (-\infty, 0) \)
2. \( (0, 36) \)
3. \( (36, \infty) \)

Testing each interval:

1. For \(x < 0\), say \(x = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37 > 0\). So, positive.
2. For \(0 < x < 36\), say \(x = 1\): \(1(1 - 36) = 1*(-35) = -35 < 0\). So, negative.
3. For \(x > 36\), say \(x = 40\): \(40(40 - 36) = 40*4 = 160 > 0\). So, positive.

Therefore, \(x(x - 36) < 0\) when \(x\) is in \( (0, 36) \). So, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative when \(x\) is in \( (0, 36) \).

But wait, earlier I thought the solution was \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \). But according to this, it's just \( (0, 36) \). However, I need to consider the numerator as well. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but since the numerator is in the absolute value, it's always non-negative. So, the expression is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but since the inequality is strict, those points are excluded.

But wait, in the interval \( (0, 36) \), the expression is negative except at \(x = 9\), where it's zero. So, the solution should be \( (0, 36) \) excluding \(x = 9\). But in my initial interval testing, I found that \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \) are both negative. So, is the solution \( (0, 36) \) excluding \(x = 9\)?

Wait, but in the initial analysis, I considered the numerator and denominator separately. The numerator is always positive except at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is negative in \( (0, 36) \). So, the entire expression is negative in \( (0, 36) \), except at \(x = 9\), where it's zero. So, the solution is \( (0, 36) \) excluding \(x = 9\).

But in my initial interval testing, I had two separate intervals: \( (0, 9) \) and \( (9, 36) \). So, is that the same as \( (0, 36) \) excluding \(x = 9\)? Yes, because \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) = (0, 36) \) without the point \(x = 9\).

Therefore, the solution is \(x\) in \( (0, 36) \) but not including \(x = 9\). However, since \(x = 9\) is already excluded because the expression is zero there, which doesn't satisfy the strict inequality, the solution is simply \( (0, 36) \).

Wait, but hold on. Let me think again. The numerator is \(|x^2 - 81|\), which is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). So, at \(x = 9\), the expression is zero, which doesn't satisfy the inequality. So, the solution is all \(x\) in \( (0, 36) \) except \(x = 9\). But since \(x = 9\) is already in \( (0, 36) \), we have to exclude it.

But in interval notation, \( (0, 36) \) already excludes the endpoints, so if we need to exclude \(x = 9\), we have to write it as \( (0, 9) \cup (9, 36) \).

Yes, that makes sense. So, the solution is \(x\) in \( (0, 9) \) or \(x\) in \( (9, 36) \).

But wait, let me confirm with another test point in \( (9, 36) \). Let's take \(x = 10\). The numerator is \(|100 - 81| = 19\), positive. The denominator is \(100 - 360 = -260\), negative. So, the expression is negative,","[Eq(-360 + 100, -260), '100 - 360 = -260']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangular field that's been bounded by an athletic track. The track is made up of two sides of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters, and I need to find the maximum possible area of the field in square meters. Hmm, okay, let me try to visualize this.

First, the Asymptote code draws a rectangle with two semicircular ends. So, the athletic track is like a rectangle with semicircles on each end, right? That makes sense because athletic tracks usually have straight sides and curved ends. So, the field inside is a rectangle, and the track goes around it, including the two semicircles.

Let me denote the length of the rectangle as 'l' and the width as 'w'. The two semicircles on the ends would each have a diameter equal to the width of the rectangle, which is 'w'. So, the radius of each semicircle would be w/2.

Now, the total length of the track is 400 meters. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The straight sides are each of length 'l', so together they contribute 2l to the total length. The two semicircular ends together make a full circle, right? Because two semicircles make a full circle. The circumference of a full circle is 2πr, where r is the radius. Since the radius is w/2, the circumference would be 2π*(w/2) = πw.

So, putting it all together, the total length of the track is 2l + πw = 400 meters. That gives me the equation:

2l + πw = 400.

I need to find the maximum area of the field, which is a rectangle with length 'l' and width 'w'. The area A is given by:

A = l * w.

So, I have two equations:

1. 2l + πw = 400
2. A = l * w

I need to maximize A with respect to the constraint given by the first equation. This sounds like an optimization problem with a constraint, so I can use calculus or maybe the method of completing the square or something similar.

Let me solve the first equation for one variable in terms of the other. Let's solve for 'l' in terms of 'w':

2l = 400 - πw
l = (400 - πw)/2
l = 200 - (πw)/2

Now, substitute this expression for 'l' into the area formula:

A = l * w = [200 - (πw)/2] * w
A = 200w - (πw²)/2

So, now I have A as a function of w:

A(w) = 200w - (π/2)w²

This is a quadratic function in terms of w, and since the coefficient of w² is negative, the parabola opens downward, meaning the vertex is the maximum point.

To find the maximum area, I can find the vertex of this parabola. The vertex occurs at w = -b/(2a) for a quadratic equation in the form ax² + bx + c. In this case, a = -π/2 and b = 200.

So, plugging into the formula:

w = -b/(2a) = -200 / (2*(-π/2)) = -200 / (-π) = 200/π

So, the width w that maximizes the area is 200/π meters.

Now, let's find the corresponding length 'l' using the earlier expression:

l = 200 - (πw)/2
Substitute w = 200/π:

l = 200 - (π*(200/π))/2
Simplify:

l = 200 - (200)/2
l = 200 - 100
l = 100 meters

So, the length is 100 meters and the width is 200/π meters.

Now, let's compute the area:

A = l * w = 100 * (200/π) = 20000/π

Calculating that numerically, since π is approximately 3.1416, so:

20000 / 3.1416 ≈ 6366.1977

But since the problem asks for the answer in terms of π, I think it's better to leave it as 20000/π square meters.

Wait, let me double-check my steps to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

1. I defined the track as two straight sides of length 'l' and two semicircular ends with diameter 'w', so radius w/2. That seems correct.

2. The total length of the track is 2l + πw = 400. That makes sense because the two semicircles add up to a full circle with circumference πw.

3. Expressed 'l' in terms of 'w': l = 200 - (πw)/2. That seems correct.

4. Substituted into area: A = w*(200 - (πw)/2) = 200w - (π/2)w². That looks good.

5. Took derivative or found vertex: Since it's a quadratic, vertex at w = -b/(2a). Here, a = -π/2, b = 200. So, w = 200/(2*(π/2)) = 200/π. Wait, hold on, let me recast that.

Wait, the standard form is A(w) = (-π/2)w² + 200w. So, a = -π/2, b = 200.

So, vertex at w = -b/(2a) = -200/(2*(-π/2)) = -200/(-π) = 200/π. Yes, that's correct.

Then, l = 200 - (π*(200/π))/2 = 200 - (200)/2 = 100. Correct.

Area is 100*(200/π) = 20000/π. So, that's approximately 6366.1977 m², but since the problem doesn't specify, and since π is exact, 20000/π is the exact maximum area.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there another way to approach this problem? Maybe using calculus instead of the vertex formula.

Let me try taking the derivative of A(w) with respect to w and setting it to zero.

A(w) = 200w - (π/2)w²

dA/dw = 200 - πw

Set derivative equal to zero:

200 - πw = 0
πw = 200
w = 200/π

Same result. So, that confirms it.

Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

Wait, but let me think about the units. The track is 400 meters, so the dimensions should be in meters, and the area in square meters. So, 20000/π is in square meters, which is correct.

Is there a way to express this differently? Maybe factor out something, but I think 20000/π is the simplest form.

Alternatively, if I wanted to write it as (200/π)*100, but that doesn't really help. So, 20000/π is fine.

Just to make sure, let me plug the values back into the original equation.

If w = 200/π, then l = 100.

Total track length: 2l + πw = 2*100 + π*(200/π) = 200 + 200 = 400 meters. Perfect, that matches the given total length.

So, all the steps check out. Therefore, the maximum area is 20000/π square meters.

**Final Answer**
The maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.

The problem involves finding the maximum possible area of a rectangular field bounded by an athletic track. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends, with a total length of 400 meters.

1. Define the length of the rectangle as \( l \) and the width as \( w \). The two semicircular ends each have a diameter \( w \), giving a radius of \( \frac{w}{2} \).
2. The total length of the track is given by the equation:
   \[
   2l + \pi w = 400
   \]
3. Express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):
   \[
   l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}
   \]
4. The area \( A \) of the rectangle is:
   \[
   A = l \times w
   \]
5. Substitute \( l \) into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
   \]
6. This is a quadratic function in terms of \( w \). To find the maximum area, we find the vertex of the parabola. The vertex occurs at:
   \[
   w = \frac{-b}{2a}
   \]
   where \( a = -\frac{\pi}{2} \) and \( b = 200 \). Thus,
   \[
   w = \frac{200}{\pi}
   \]
7. Substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \):
   \[
   l = 200 - \frac{\pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} = 100
   \]
8. Calculate the area:
   \[
   A = l \times w = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
   \]

The maximum possible area of the field is \boxed{\dfrac{20000}{\pi}} square meters.","[20000/pi, '\\frac{20000}{\\pi}']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"Okay, so I have this triangle RST, and it's a right triangle because there's a right angle at S. The Asymptote code shows that point T is at (0,0), S is at (2,0), and R is at (2, sqrt(21)). So, RS is the vertical side from (2,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), which means RS has a length of sqrt(21). ST is the horizontal side from (0,0) to (2,0), so that's length 2. RT is the hypotenuse, connecting (0,0) to (2, sqrt(21)), and the problem says that RT is 5 units long. 

Wait, let me confirm that. The distance between R(2, sqrt(21)) and T(0,0) should be sqrt[(2-0)^2 + (sqrt(21)-0)^2] = sqrt[4 + 21] = sqrt[25] = 5. Yep, that checks out. So, RT is indeed 5.

The problem says that sin R is 2/5, and we need to find sin T. Hmm, okay. Let me recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the opposite side over the hypotenuse. So, for angle R, which is at point R, the opposite side would be ST, and the hypotenuse is RT. Wait, is that right?

Wait, no. Let me think again. In triangle RST, angle R is at point R, so the sides opposite and adjacent to angle R would be relative to that angle. So, the side opposite angle R is ST, which is 2 units, and the hypotenuse is RT, which is 5 units. So, sin R = opposite/hypotenuse = ST/RT = 2/5. That matches the given information, so that's correct.

Now, we need to find sin T. Angle T is at point T, which is the right angle? Wait, no, the right angle is at S. So, angle T is one of the acute angles. So, in triangle RST, the right angle is at S, so angles at R and T are the other two angles.

So, angle T is at point T, which is (0,0). So, the sides relative to angle T: the opposite side would be RS, which is sqrt(21), and the adjacent side would be ST, which is 2. The hypotenuse is RT, which is 5.

So, sin T would be opposite over hypotenuse, which is RS/RT. RS is sqrt(21), so sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

Wait, let me make sure. So, angle T is at (0,0). The sides: opposite to T is RS, which is vertical, length sqrt(21). Adjacent is ST, which is 2. Hypotenuse is RT, 5. So, yes, sin T = opposite/hypotenuse = sqrt(21)/5.

Alternatively, since in a right triangle, the two non-right angles are complementary, so angle R + angle T = 90 degrees. Therefore, sin T = cos R. Since sin R = 2/5, cos R would be sqrt(1 - (2/5)^2) = sqrt(1 - 4/25) = sqrt(21/25) = sqrt(21)/5. So, that's another way to see that sin T = sqrt(21)/5.

So, both methods give the same result, which is reassuring. Therefore, sin T is sqrt(21)/5.

**Final Answer**
The value of $\sin{T}$ is \boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}.
</think>

Given the right triangle \( \triangle RST \) with a right angle at \( S \), we know the following:
- The coordinates of the points are \( T(0,0) \), \( S(2,0) \), and \( R(2, \sqrt{21}) \).
- The length of \( RT \) (the hypotenuse) is 5 units.
- \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \).

To find \( \sin{T} \):
1. Recognize that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.
2. For angle \( R \), the opposite side is \( ST \) (length 2) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \) (length 5), confirming \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \).
3. For angle \( T \), the opposite side is \( RS \) (length \( \sqrt{21} \)) and the hypotenuse is \( RT \) (length 5).
4. Therefore, \( \sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \).

Additionally, since angles \( R \) and \( T \) are complementary, \( \sin{T} = \cos{R} \). Calculating \( \cos{R} \) using \( \sin{R} = \frac{2}{5} \):
- \( \cos{R} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \).

Thus, the value of \( \sin{T} \) is \(\boxed{\dfrac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The answer should be expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are positive integers, and \( a \) is square-free. Then, I need to find \( a + b \).

Hmm, let me think about how to approach this. I remember that the distance from a point to another point is given by the distance formula. So, if I have a point \( (x, y) \) on the graph, the distance from the origin \( (0, 0) \) to this point is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since I want the minimal distance, I can instead minimize the square of the distance to make the calculations easier, because the square root function is monotonically increasing.

So, let me define the distance squared as a function of \( x \):

\( D(x) = x^2 + y^2 \).

But since \( y \) is given by the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), I can substitute that into the distance formula:

\( D(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \).

Let me compute that step by step. First, square the \( y \) term:

\( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 (x^2 - 3)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \).

So, the distance squared becomes:

\( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \).

Now, I need to find the value of \( x \) that minimizes \( D(x) \). To do this, I can take the derivative of \( D(x) \) with respect to \( x \), set it equal to zero, and solve for \( x \).

Let me compute the derivative \( D'(x) \):

First, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\( (x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9 \).

So, \( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \).

Let me distribute the \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \).

Combine like terms:

\( D(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \).

Now, take the derivative with respect to \( x \):

\( D'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right) \).

Compute term by term:

- The derivative of \( \frac{1}{2}x^4 \) is \( 2x^3 \).
- The derivative of \( -2x^2 \) is \( -4x \).
- The derivative of \( \frac{9}{2} \) is 0.

So, \( D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \).

To find critical points, set \( D'(x) = 0 \):

\( 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \).

Factor out common terms:

\( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \).

So, the solutions are:

1. \( 2x = 0 \) => \( x = 0 \).
2. \( x^2 - 2 = 0 \) => \( x^2 = 2 \) => \( x = \sqrt{2} \) or \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Now, I need to determine which of these critical points gives the minimal distance. Since distance is always positive, I can evaluate \( D(x) \) at each critical point and see which one is the smallest.

First, evaluate at \( x = 0 \):

\( D(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = 0 - 0 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \).

Next, evaluate at \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

First, compute \( x^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

Then, \( D(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} \).

Wait, hold on, that might not be the right way to compute it. Let me go back to the original expression for \( D(x) \):

\( D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \).

So, plugging \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\( D(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{1}{2}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 \).

Compute each term:

\( (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

\( (\sqrt{2})^2 - 3 = 2 - 3 = -1 \).

So, \( (-1)^2 = 1 \).

Thus, \( D(\sqrt{2}) = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(1) = 2 + \frac{1}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \).

Similarly, for \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), since \( x^2 \) is the same, the distance squared will also be \( \frac{5}{2} \).

So, comparing the values:

- At \( x = 0 \), \( D(0) = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5 \).
- At \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \), \( D(x) = \frac{5}{2} = 2.5 \).

Therefore, the minimal distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \).

But the problem asks for the distance expressed as \( \sqrt{a}/b \). Let me rewrite \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} \):

\( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} \).

To rationalize the denominator, multiply numerator and denominator by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\( \frac{\sqrt{5} \cdot \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \).

So, the minimal distance is \( \sqrt{10}/2 \).

Therefore, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since 10 is square-free (its prime factors are 2 and 5, neither of which is squared), this satisfies the condition.

Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

Wait, hold on, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make a mistake.

Starting from the derivative:

\( D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \). Setting to zero gives \( 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \), so \( x = 0 \) or \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). That seems correct.

Evaluating \( D(x) \) at \( x = 0 \):

\( D(0) = 0 + \frac{1}{2}(0 - 3)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(9) = \frac{9}{2} \). Correct.

At \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\( D(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{1}{2}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(2 - 3)^2 = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(1) = 2.5 \). Correct.

So, minimal distance squared is \( 2.5 = \frac{5}{2} \), so distance is \( \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \). So, \( a = 10 \), \( b = 2 \), so \( a + b = 12 \). That seems right.

But just to be thorough, let me check if there are any other critical points or if I missed something.

The function \( D(x) \) is a quartic function, which tends to infinity as \( x \) approaches positive or negative infinity. So, the minimal distance should occur at one of the critical points we found, which are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). Since \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \) give a smaller distance, that's the minimal.

Alternatively, another way to approach this problem is by using the formula for the distance from a point to a curve, which involves calculus, but I think I did it correctly.

Alternatively, maybe using geometry or algebra, but calculus seems straightforward here.

Wait, another thought: sometimes, minimal distance can also be found by considering the line from the origin to the curve being perpendicular to the tangent of the curve at that point. Let me see if that gives the same result.

So, the slope of the tangent to the curve at point \( (x, y) \) is \( dy/dx \). Let's compute that.

Given \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), so \( dy/dx = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}x \).

The slope of the line from the origin to the point \( (x, y) \) is \( y/x \). For the line to be perpendicular to the tangent, the product of their slopes should be \( -1 \).

So, \( (y/x) \cdot (\sqrt{2}x) = -1 \).

Simplify:

\( y \cdot \sqrt{2} = -1 \).

But \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), so substitute:

\( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \cdot \sqrt{2} = -1 \).

Simplify:

\( (x^2 - 3) = -1 \).

So, \( x^2 - 3 = -1 \) => \( x^2 = 2 \) => \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \).

Which is the same result as before. So, that confirms that the minimal distance occurs at \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \).

Therefore, the minimal distance is indeed \( \sqrt{10}/2 \), so \( a = 10 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( a + b = 12 \).

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning.

To find the minimal distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance squared from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance squared is given by:

\[ D(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \]

Simplifying the expression inside the distance formula:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]

Thus, the distance squared becomes:

\[ D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[ D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \]
\[ D(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ D(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( D(x) \):

\[ D'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero:

\[ 2x^3 - 4x = 0 \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives the solutions:

\[ x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]

Evaluating \( D(x) \) at these critical points:

- At \( x = 0 \):
  \[ D(0) = \frac{9}{2} \]

- At \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):
  \[ D(\sqrt{2}) = 2 + \frac{1}{2}(1) = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimal distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimal distance is:

\[ \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"Okay, so I have this function f defined piecewise, and I need to find f inverse of 0 plus f inverse of 6. Hmm, let me write down the function first to make sure I understand it correctly.

The function f(x) is defined as:
- 3 - x when x is less than or equal to 3,
- -x³ + 2x² + 3x when x is greater than 3.

So, f(x) is a piecewise function with two different expressions depending on whether x is less than or equal to 3 or greater than 3. I need to find the inverses at 0 and 6, then add them together.

First, let me recall what an inverse function does. The inverse function f⁻¹(y) gives me the x such that f(x) = y. So, to find f⁻¹(0), I need to solve f(x) = 0, and similarly for f⁻¹(6), solve f(x) = 6.

Since f is piecewise, I need to check both pieces for each equation.

Starting with f⁻¹(0):

Case 1: x ≤ 3. Then f(x) = 3 - x. So, set 3 - x = 0. Solving for x, I get x = 3. But wait, x has to be ≤ 3, so x = 3 is valid here. So, f(3) = 0, which means f⁻¹(0) = 3.

But hold on, I should also check the other piece to make sure there isn't another solution. So, Case 2: x > 3. Then f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Let's set that equal to 0:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0.

Factor out an x:

x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0.

So, x = 0 or -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

But x = 0 is not in the domain x > 3, so we can ignore that. Now, solve -x² + 2x + 3 = 0.

Multiply both sides by -1 to make it easier:

x² - 2x - 3 = 0.

Factor this quadratic: looking for two numbers that multiply to -3 and add to -2. Hmm, 1 and -3? Yes, (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0.

So, x = 3 or x = -1. Again, x must be greater than 3, so x = 3 is the boundary, but in this case, x > 3, so x = 3 is not included here. x = -1 is also not in the domain. So, in the x > 3 case, there's no solution for f(x) = 0. Therefore, the only solution is x = 3 from the first case.

So, f⁻¹(0) = 3.

Now, moving on to f⁻¹(6). Again, I need to solve f(x) = 6.

First, check the first piece: x ≤ 3, f(x) = 3 - x. So, set 3 - x = 6.

Solving for x: 3 - x = 6 => -x = 3 => x = -3.

Is x = -3 ≤ 3? Yes, it is. So, that's a valid solution. So, f(-3) = 6, which means f⁻¹(6) = -3.

But again, I should check the other piece to make sure there isn't another solution. So, for x > 3, f(x) = -x³ + 2x² + 3x. Set that equal to 6:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6.

Bring 6 to the left side:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0.

Let me rewrite this as:

-x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 = 0.

Hmm, solving a cubic equation. Maybe I can factor this. Let me try possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. The possible roots are factors of 6 over factors of 1, so ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6.

Let me test x = 1:

-1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = (-1 + 2) + (3 - 6) = 1 - 3 = -2 ≠ 0.

x = 2:

-8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = (-8 + 8) + (6 - 6) = 0 + 0 = 0. Oh, x = 2 is a root.

So, (x - 2) is a factor. Let's perform polynomial division or factor it out.

Divide -x³ + 2x² + 3x - 6 by (x - 2). Alternatively, factor it.

Let me write it as:

(-x³ + 2x²) + (3x - 6) = -x²(x - 2) + 3(x - 2) = (-x² + 3)(x - 2).

So, factoring gives (x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0.

Set each factor equal to zero:

x - 2 = 0 => x = 2.

-x² + 3 = 0 => x² = 3 => x = ±√3.

So, the roots are x = 2, x = √3, x = -√3.

But in this case, we're looking for x > 3. So, x = 2 is less than 3, so not in the domain. x = √3 is approximately 1.732, which is also less than 3. x = -√3 is negative, so also not in the domain. Therefore, in the x > 3 case, there are no solutions. So, the only solution is x = -3 from the first piece.

Wait, hold on, no. Wait, when I solved f(x) = 6 for x ≤ 3, I got x = -3, which is valid. But when I checked the x > 3 case, I found that the equation f(x) = 6 has roots at x = 2, √3, -√3, but none of these are greater than 3. So, indeed, the only solution is x = -3.

Therefore, f⁻¹(6) = -3.

So, now, adding them together: f⁻¹(0) + f⁻¹(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

Wait, that seems too straightforward. Let me double-check my work.

For f⁻¹(0):

First piece: 3 - x = 0 => x = 3. Correct.

Second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 0. Factored as x(-x² + 2x + 3) = 0. Solutions x = 0, x = 3, x = -1. None of these are greater than 3 except x = 3, but x > 3 is the domain, so no solution there. So, only x = 3. Correct.

For f⁻¹(6):

First piece: 3 - x = 6 => x = -3. Correct.

Second piece: -x³ + 2x² + 3x = 6. Factored as (x - 2)(-x² + 3) = 0. Solutions x = 2, x = √3, x = -√3. None are greater than 3, so no solution in that domain. So, only x = -3. Correct.

Therefore, adding 3 and -3 gives 0. So, the answer is 0.

But just to be thorough, let me verify f(-3) and f(3):

f(-3): Since -3 ≤ 3, use 3 - (-3) = 6. Correct.

f(3): Since 3 ≤ 3, use 3 - 3 = 0. Correct.

So, everything checks out. Therefore, f⁻¹(0) + f⁻¹(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

\boxed{0}
</think>

To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) for the piecewise function \( f \) defined as:
\[ f(x) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{array}
\right. \]

First, we solve for \( f^{-1}(0) \):
- For \( x \leq 3 \), set \( 3 - x = 0 \). Solving gives \( x = 3 \).
- For \( x > 3 \), set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \). Factoring gives \( x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \), leading to solutions \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). None of these are greater than 3, so no solution in this domain.

Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, we solve for \( f^{-1}(6) \):
- For \( x \leq 3 \), set \( 3 - x = 6 \). Solving gives \( x = -3 \).
- For \( x > 3 \), set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \). Factoring gives \( (x - 2)(-x^2 + 3) = 0 \), leading to solutions \( x = 2 \), \( x = \sqrt{3} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \). None of these are greater than 3, so no solution in this domain.

Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Adding these results together:
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

"Okay, so I have this problem where there's a point P inside a regular octahedron, and the distances from P to five of its vertices are given: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. I need to find the distance from P to the sixth vertex. Hmm, interesting. I remember that a regular octahedron has eight triangular faces and six vertices, right? It's like two square pyramids glued together at their bases.

First, let me visualize the octahedron. It has two apex vertices and four base vertices. In the Asymptote code provided, the vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F. From the coordinates given, A is (1,0,0), B is (-1,0,0), C is (0,1,0), D is (0,-1,0), E is (0,0,1), and F is (0,0,-1). So, A and B are on the x-axis, C and D on the y-axis, and E and F on the z-axis. That makes sense for a regular octahedron centered at the origin.

Point P is at (1.2, 1.5, 1). Wait, but in the problem, the distances from P to five vertices are given, but in the Asymptote code, P is at (1.2,1.5,1). Is that the same point? Or is that just an example? Hmm, maybe the Asymptote code is just for illustration, and the actual problem is more general. So, I shouldn't rely on the specific coordinates of P in the Asymptote code.

So, the key here is that P is some point inside the octahedron, and we know its distances to five of the six vertices. We need to find the sixth distance. I think this might relate to some geometric property or theorem. Maybe something about the sum of squares of distances from a point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron?

Wait, I recall that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any interior point to the six vertices is constant. Is that true? Let me think. For a regular octahedron, which is a dual of a cube, maybe there's a similar property as in the cube where the sum of squares of distances from a point to opposite vertices is constant.

Let me try to recall. In a cube, for any point inside, the sum of the squares of the distances to opposite vertices is equal. But in an octahedron, which is dual, maybe the sum of the squares of the distances to all six vertices is constant? Or perhaps the sum of the squares to each pair of opposite vertices is the same?

Wait, let me think more carefully. In a regular octahedron, each vertex has an opposite vertex. So, for example, A is opposite to B, C is opposite to D, and E is opposite to F. So, maybe for each pair of opposite vertices, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to each pair is the same?

Alternatively, maybe the sum of the squares of all six distances is a constant, regardless of where P is inside the octahedron. That might be the case. Let me try to verify this.

Suppose the octahedron is centered at the origin, as in the Asymptote code. Then, the coordinates of the vertices are (1,0,0), (-1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,-1,0), (0,0,1), (0,0,-1). Let P be a point (x, y, z). Then, the squared distances from P to each vertex are:

- To A: (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
- To B: (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
- To C: x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2
- To D: x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2
- To E: x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2
- To F: x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2

Now, let's compute the sum of all these squared distances:

Sum = [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]

Let me expand each term:

First term: (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
Second term: (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
Third term: x^2 + (y^2 - 2y + 1) + z^2
Fourth term: x^2 + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + z^2
Fifth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1)
Sixth term: x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1)

Now, let's add them all up:

Sum = [x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1] + [x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1]

Now, let's combine like terms:

Looking at the x terms: -2x and +2x cancel out. Similarly, -2y and +2y cancel, and -2z and +2z cancel. So, all the linear terms cancel.

Now, the constants: each term has a +1, and there are six terms, so 6*1 = 6.

Now, the squared terms: each term has x^2, y^2, z^2. Let's count how many times each appears.

For x^2: in the first term, second term, third term, fourth term, fifth term, sixth term. So, 6 x^2 terms.

Similarly, y^2: 6 y^2 terms.

Similarly, z^2: 6 z^2 terms.

So, Sum = 6x^2 + 6y^2 + 6z^2 + 6

Factor out the 6: Sum = 6(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1)

But wait, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 is the squared distance from P to the origin. Let's denote that as OP^2.

So, Sum = 6(OP^2 + 1)

Hmm, interesting. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is equal to six times (the square of the distance from P to the center plus one). But wait, in a regular octahedron, the distance from the center to each vertex is 1, right? Because the vertices are at (1,0,0), etc., so the distance from the origin is 1.

So, if the octahedron is centered at the origin, then the distance from the center to each vertex is 1. So, OP is the distance from P to the center, and the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is 6(OP^2 + 1). But is this a constant? It depends on OP, which varies depending on where P is.

Wait, but in the problem, we are given that P is inside the octahedron, but we don't know its position. So, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is 6(OP^2 + 1). So, unless OP is fixed, this sum isn't a constant. Hmm, so maybe my initial thought was wrong.

Wait, but maybe in the problem, the octahedron is scaled differently. In the Asymptote code, the vertices are at (1,0,0), etc., but maybe in the actual problem, the octahedron is scaled so that the distance from the center to each vertex is something else. Wait, but the problem doesn't specify, so I think we can assume it's a unit octahedron, with vertices at distance 1 from the center.

But then, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices is 6(OP^2 + 1). So, unless OP is fixed, this sum isn't a constant. Therefore, maybe the sum isn't a constant, but perhaps the sum of the squares of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices is constant?

Let me check that. Let's compute the sum of the squares of the distances to A and B, which are opposite vertices.

Sum_AB = [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] = (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

Similarly, Sum_CD = [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

And Sum_EF = [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2] = 2x^2 + 2y^2 + 2z^2 + 2

So, each pair of opposite vertices contributes the same sum: 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1). Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances to each pair of opposite vertices is equal, and each is equal to 2(OP^2 + 1). Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances to all six vertices is 6(OP^2 + 1), as before.

But since OP varies, the total sum isn't a constant. So, maybe the problem is using a different property.

Wait, but in the problem, we are given five distances, and we need to find the sixth. So, perhaps the sum of the squares of all six distances is a constant, regardless of where P is. But from our earlier calculation, it's 6(OP^2 + 1), which depends on OP. So, unless OP is fixed, which it isn't, the sum isn't fixed.

Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again.

Wait, perhaps the octahedron is not centered at the origin in the problem? Or maybe it's scaled differently. Wait, the Asymptote code shows a specific octahedron, but the problem doesn't specify. So, maybe the octahedron is scaled such that the distance from the center to each vertex is something else, say 'a'. Then, the sum of the squares of the distances from P to all six vertices would be 6(OP^2 + a^2). But unless we know 'a', we can't proceed.

Wait, but in the Asymptote code, the vertices are at (1,0,0), etc., so the distance from the center is 1. So, maybe in the problem, the octahedron is unit, so a=1. Then, the sum of the squares is 6(OP^2 + 1). But since we don't know OP, we can't compute the sum.

Wait, but maybe the problem is using a different approach. Maybe the sum of the squares of the distances to all six vertices is equal to 6 times the square of the distance from P to the center plus 6. So, if we can find OP, we can compute the sum.

But we don't know OP. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe the problem is using the fact that in a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any interior point to the six vertices is constant. But from our earlier calculation, it's 6(OP^2 + 1), which isn't constant unless OP is fixed. So, that can't be.

Wait, maybe I made a mistake in my calculation. Let me double-check.

Sum of squares:

Sum = [(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2] + [x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2]

Expanding each:

1. (x^2 - 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
2. (x^2 + 2x + 1) + y^2 + z^2
3. x^2 + (y^2 - 2y + 1) + z^2
4. x^2 + (y^2 + 2y + 1) + z^2
5. x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 - 2z + 1)
6. x^2 + y^2 + (z^2 + 2z + 1)

Adding all together:

Sum = (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) + (x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2) + (x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2) + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1) + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1)

Zdaj je potrebno vsa rokovanja sešteje: 60 (med čarovnicami in čarovnikami) + 15 (med čarovnicami samimi) + 0 (med čarovnikami samimi) = 75.

Zato je skupno število rokovanj na srečanju 75.
</think>

**Rešitev:**

Na čarobnem srečanju je bilo šest čarovnic in deset čarovnikov. Rokovanja so se zgodila med:

1. **Čarovnicami in čarovnikami:**
   - Vsaka čarovnica je rokovala z vsakim čarovnikom.
   - Število rokovanj: \(6 \times 10 = 60\).

2. **Čarovnicami samimi:**
   - Čarovnice so med seboj dobre prijateljice, kar pomeni, da je vsaka čarovnica rokovala z drugima.
   - Število rokovanj je enako številu kombinacij 6 čarovnic po 2:
     \[
     \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15
     \]

3. **Čarovnikami samimi:**
   - Čarovniki so med seboj sovražili in se niso rokovali.
   - Število rokovanj: \(0\).

**Skupno število rokovanj:**
\[
60 \, (\text{med čarovnicami in čarovnikami}) + 15 \, (\text{med čarovnicami samimi}) + 0 \, (\text{med čarovnikami samimi}) = 75
\]

**Odgovor:**

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is equal to \( f(x-1) \), I can use a simple method. Instead of expanding the entire polynomial, I can substitute \( x = 1 \) into \( g(x) \). This works because substituting \( x = 1 \) into a polynomial effectively sums all its coefficients.

So, \( g(1) = f(1 - 1) = f(0) \).

Next, I calculate \( f(0) \) by substituting \( x = 0 \) into the original polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the set of values \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the four distinct roots of the equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Hmm, okay, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that for polynomials, especially quartic ones, Vieta's formulas can be really helpful. Vieta's relates the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. So maybe I can use that here.

The given polynomial is \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let me write it in the standard form: \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\). So, the coefficients are 1, 2, 0, 0, 2.

Vieta's formulas for a quartic equation \(x^4 + a x^3 + b x^2 + c x + d = 0\) tell us that:

1. The sum of the roots: \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a\).
2. The sum of the products of the roots two at a time: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = b\).
3. The sum of the products of the roots three at a time: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c\).
4. The product of all roots: \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\).

Plugging in the coefficients from our polynomial:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\).
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\).
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\).
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\).

Okay, so I need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let me denote these three expressions as \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) respectively. So,

\(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\),
\(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\),
\(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

I need to find the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\). Since the problem says ""neporeden množico,"" which I think means ""unordered set,"" the order doesn't matter, just the values.

Looking at Vieta's, I know that the sum of all the two-element products is 0. So,

\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\).

But wait, that's exactly the sum of all two-element products, which is 0. So,

\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\).

That's one equation. Now, I need more information to find the individual values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Maybe I can find the sum of their squares or something else.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products of these \(S_i\) terms. Let me think.

Wait, another approach: if I can find a polynomial whose roots are \(S_1, S_2, S_3\), then I can find the set by finding the roots of that polynomial.

To construct such a polynomial, I can use symmetric sums. Let me denote the new polynomial as \(y^3 + py^2 + qy + r = 0\), where the roots are \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). Then, by Vieta's for this cubic:

1. \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -p\).
2. \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3 = q\).
3. \(S_1S_2S_3 = -r\).

We already know that \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), so \(p = 0\). So the polynomial is \(y^3 + qy + r = 0\).

Now, I need to find \(q\) and \(r\). Let's compute \(q = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\) and \(r = -S_1S_2S_3\).

First, let's compute \(q\). So,

\(q = S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\).

Let me compute each term:

\(S_1S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\).

Let me expand this:

\(\alpha_1\alpha_2 \cdot \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2 \cdot \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \cdot \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \cdot \alpha_2\alpha_4\).

Simplify each term:

1. \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\)
4. \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\)

Hmm, this seems complicated. Maybe there's a better way.

Alternatively, perhaps I can use the identity that relates the sum of products \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\) to other symmetric sums.

Wait, another idea: consider that \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the sums of products of roots two at a time, but grouped differently. Maybe I can relate this to the elementary symmetric sums.

Let me recall that:

\(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) (we already have that).

Also, the sum of the squares of the roots: \((\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)\).

We know that \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), so squaring that gives 4.

And the sum of the two-element products is 0, so:

\(4 = (\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2) + 2 \times 0\).

Thus, \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = 4\).

Hmm, not sure if that helps directly, but maybe.

Alternatively, perhaps I can consider the products \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\). Let me try to compute this.

First, \(S_1S_2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)\).

Expanding this:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2\).

Similarly, \(S_1S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\).

Expanding:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4\).

And \(S_2S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)\).

Expanding:

\(\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\).

So, adding all these together, \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\) is equal to:

\[
\begin{align*}
& \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 \\
& + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 \\
& + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4
\end{align*}
\]

Hmm, this is getting quite messy. Maybe I can factor terms or find a pattern.

Looking at the terms, each term is a product of three roots, with one root squared. For example, \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_4\), etc.

Wait, so each term is of the form \(\alpha_i^2\alpha_j\alpha_k\) where \(i, j, k\) are distinct.

So, perhaps I can factor this as:

\(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)\).

Wait, let me check:

If I factor out \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\), then each term would be \(\alpha_i\), but in our case, each term is \(\alpha_i^2\alpha_j\alpha_k\), so factoring out \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\) would leave \(\alpha_i\), but in our case, it's \(\alpha_i^2\alpha_j\alpha_k\), so actually, it's \(\alpha_i \times \alpha_j\alpha_k\). Hmm, maybe not directly.

Alternatively, perhaps I can write each term as \(\alpha_i \times \alpha_j\alpha_k\alpha_l\), but that might not help.

Wait, another idea: Let me consider that each term in \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\) is a product of three roots, with one root squared. So, perhaps I can express this in terms of the elementary symmetric sums.

Let me denote \(P = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\).

Also, the sum of the products of three roots is \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\).

Wait, so the sum of the products of three roots is 0. Let me denote this as \(T = 0\).

Now, looking back at the expression for \(S_1S_2 + S_1S_3 + S_2S_3\), each term is \(\alpha_i^2\alpha_j\alpha_k\). So, for each root \(\alpha_i\), we have terms where \(\alpha_i\) is squared and multiplied by the product of the other two roots.

So, for \(\alpha_1\), the terms are \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_3\alpha_4\).

"Okay, so I have this problem about a rectangle ABCD with center O, and the ratio of AB to AD is k. A point is randomly chosen from the interior of the rectangle, and I need to find the probability that this point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices. Hmm, interesting.

First, let me visualize the rectangle. Since it's a rectangle, opposite sides are equal and all angles are right angles. The center O is the intersection point of the diagonals, right? So, if I consider the rectangle with coordinates, maybe it's easier to place it on a coordinate system with O at the origin. That might simplify things.

Let me assign coordinates to the rectangle. Let's say point A is at (-a, b), B at (a, b), C at (a, -b), and D at (-a, -b). Then, the center O is at (0, 0). The sides AB and AD would then have lengths 2a and 2b respectively. The ratio AB/AD is given as k, so 2a / 2b = a/b = k. Therefore, a = k*b. That might be useful later.

Now, the problem is about finding the region within the rectangle where any point is closer to O than to any of the four vertices A, B, C, D. The probability would then be the area of this region divided by the area of the entire rectangle.

So, I need to find the set of all points (x, y) inside the rectangle such that the distance from (x, y) to O is less than the distance from (x, y) to each of A, B, C, D.

Mathematically, for a point (x, y), the distance to O is sqrt(x² + y²). The distances to the vertices are:

- Distance to A: sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²)
- Distance to B: sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²)
- Distance to C: sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²)
- Distance to D: sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²)

We need the point (x, y) to satisfy:

sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y - b)²)

sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y - b)²)

sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x - a)² + (y + b)²)

sqrt(x² + y²) < sqrt((x + a)² + (y + b)²)

Since square roots are positive, I can square both sides of each inequality without changing the inequality direction. Let's do that for each condition.

First inequality:

x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y - b)²

Expanding the right side:

(x + a)² = x² + 2a x + a²

(y - b)² = y² - 2b y + b²

So, adding them: x² + 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b²

Subtracting left side (x² + y²) from both sides:

0 < 2a x + a² - 2b y + b²

So, 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

Similarly, let's do the second inequality:

x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y - b)²

Expanding:

(x - a)² = x² - 2a x + a²

(y - b)² = y² - 2b y + b²

Adding them: x² - 2a x + a² + y² - 2b y + b²

Subtracting left side:

0 < -2a x + a² - 2b y + b²

So, -2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

Third inequality:

x² + y² < (x - a)² + (y + b)²

Expanding:

(x - a)² = x² - 2a x + a²

(y + b)² = y² + 2b y + b²

Adding them: x² - 2a x + a² + y² + 2b y + b²

Subtracting left side:

0 < -2a x + a² + 2b y + b²

So, -2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

Fourth inequality:

x² + y² < (x + a)² + (y + b)²

Expanding:

(x + a)² = x² + 2a x + a²

(y + b)² = y² + 2b y + b²

Adding them: x² + 2a x + a² + y² + 2b y + b²

Subtracting left side:

0 < 2a x + a² + 2b y + b²

So, 2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

So, now I have four inequalities:

1. 2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0
2. -2a x - 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0
3. -2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0
4. 2a x + 2b y + (a² + b²) > 0

These are linear inequalities, so each represents a half-plane. The region where all four inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of these four half-planes, which should form a polygon inside the rectangle.

Let me try to write each inequality in a more manageable form.

Divide each inequality by 2:

1. a x - b y + (a² + b²)/2 > 0
2. -a x - b y + (a² + b²)/2 > 0
3. -a x + b y + (a² + b²)/2 > 0
4. a x + b y + (a² + b²)/2 > 0

Let me denote c = (a² + b²)/2 for simplicity.

So, the inequalities become:

1. a x - b y + c > 0
2. -a x - b y + c > 0
3. -a x + b y + c > 0
4. a x + b y + c > 0

These are four linear inequalities. Let me try to find the region where all four are satisfied.

Alternatively, I can write each inequality as:

1. a x - b y > -c
2. -a x - b y > -c
3. -a x + b y > -c
4. a x + b y > -c

Hmm, perhaps it's better to rearrange each inequality to express y in terms of x or vice versa.

Let me take the first inequality:

a x - b y > -c

=> -b y > -c - a x

Multiply both sides by (-1), which reverses the inequality:

b y < c + a x

=> y < (c + a x)/b

Similarly, second inequality:

-a x - b y > -c

=> -b y > -c + a x

Multiply by (-1):

b y < c - a x

=> y < (c - a x)/b

Third inequality:

-a x + b y > -c

=> b y > -c + a x

=> y > (a x - c)/b

Fourth inequality:

a x + b y > -c

=> b y > -c - a x

=> y > (-c - a x)/b

So, now I have four inequalities:

1. y < (c + a x)/b
2. y < (c - a x)/b
3. y > (a x - c)/b
4. y > (-c - a x)/b

So, the region is bounded by these four lines. Let me try to plot these lines mentally.

First, let's note that c = (a² + b²)/2.

So, substituting c:

1. y < [(a² + b²)/2 + a x]/b
2. y < [(a² + b²)/2 - a x]/b
3. y > [a x - (a² + b²)/2]/b
4. y > [ - (a² + b²)/2 - a x ]/b

Simplify each:

1. y < (a x)/b + (a² + b²)/(2b)
2. y < (-a x)/b + (a² + b²)/(2b)
3. y > (a x)/b - (a² + b²)/(2b)
4. y > (-a x)/b - (a² + b²)/(2b)

So, these are four straight lines with slopes ±a/b and intercepts ±(a² + b²)/(2b).

Let me denote m = a/b, so the slopes become ±m.

Also, the intercepts are ±(a² + b²)/(2b). Let's compute that:

(a² + b²)/(2b) = (a²)/(2b) + b/2 = (a²)/(2b) + b/2.

But since a = k b, as we had earlier, let's substitute a = k b.

So, a = k b, so a² = k² b².

Therefore, (a² + b²)/(2b) = (k² b² + b²)/(2b) = b(k² + 1)/2.

So, the intercepts become ±b(k² + 1)/2.

Similarly, the slopes m = a/b = k.

So, now, the four lines can be rewritten as:

1. y < k x + b(k² + 1)/2
2. y < -k x + b(k² + 1)/2
3. y > k x - b(k² + 1)/2
4. y > -k x - b(k² + 1)/2

So, these are four lines forming a diamond (a rotated square) centered at the origin.

Wait, actually, if I plot these four lines, they form a diamond shape. The region where all four inequalities are satisfied is the intersection inside this diamond.

But we also have the rectangle ABCD, so the region we are interested in is the intersection of this diamond with the rectangle.

But since the diamond is centered at the origin and the rectangle is also centered at the origin, the intersection should be symmetric.

Wait, but the diamond might extend beyond the rectangle or not, depending on the size.

Wait, let's think about the diamond. The diamond is defined by the four lines above. The distance from the origin to each side of the diamond is equal, right?

Wait, actually, the diamond is a square rotated by 45 degrees, but scaled.

But in our case, the slopes are k and -k, so it's not necessarily a square unless k=1.

Wait, if k=1, then the slopes are 1 and -1, so it's a square rotated by 45 degrees. But for other k, it's a diamond with different aspect ratio.

But regardless, the region where all four inequalities hold is the interior of this diamond.

But we need to find the area within the rectangle where the point is inside this diamond.

So, the area we need is the area of the intersection between the diamond and the rectangle.

But since the diamond is centered at the origin and the rectangle is also centered at the origin, the intersection is just the diamond, provided that the diamond is entirely inside the rectangle.

Wait, is the diamond entirely inside the rectangle?

Let me check.

The diamond is defined by the four lines:

y = k x + b(k² + 1)/2

y = -k x + b(k² + 1)/2

y = k x - b(k² + 1)/2

y = -k x - b(k² + 1)/2

So, the diamond's vertices are where these lines intersect each other.

Let me find the intersection points.

First, find where y = k x + b(k² + 1)/2 intersects y = -k x + b(k² + 1)/2.

Set them equal:

k x + b(k² + 1)/2 = -k x + b(k² + 1)/2

=> 2k x = 0 => x = 0

Then, y = b(k² + 1)/2.

So, one vertex is at (0, b(k² + 1)/2).

Similarly, find where y = -k x + b(k² + 1)/2 intersects y = k x - b(k² + 1)/2.

Set equal:

-k x + b(k² + 1)/2 = k x - b(k² + 1)/2

=> -2k x = -b(k² + 1)

=> x = [b(k² + 1)]/(2k)

Then, y = -k * [b(k² + 1)/(2k)] + b(k² + 1)/2

= -b(k² + 1)/2 + b(k² + 1)/2 = 0

So, another vertex is at ( [b(k² + 1)]/(2k), 0 )

Similarly, the other two vertices will be symmetric:

(0, -b(k² + 1)/2) and (- [b(k² + 1)]/(2k), 0 )

So, the diamond has four vertices:

(0, b(k² + 1)/2), ( [b(k² + 1)]/(2k), 0 ), (0, -b(k² + 1)/2), (- [b(k² + 1)]/(2k), 0 )

So, the diamond is a kite-shaped quadrilateral with two vertices on the y-axis and two on the x-axis.

Now, we need to check if this diamond is entirely inside the rectangle.

The rectangle has width 2a and height 2b.

Given that a = k b, the rectangle has width 2k b and height 2b.

So, the diamond's vertices on the y-axis are at y = ±b(k² + 1)/2.

Compare this to the rectangle's height, which is 2b.

So, b(k² + 1)/2 must be less than or equal to b for the diamond to fit within the rectangle vertically.

Similarly, the diamond's vertices on the x-axis are at x = ± [b(k² + 1)]/(2k).

Compare this to the rectangle's width, which is 2k b.

So, [b(k² + 1)]/(2k) must be less than or equal to k","[1, '1']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True

Skupaj je to 27,47 + 35,23 + 37,37 + 26,52 = 126,6 USD.

"Okay, so I have this magic square problem here. A magic square is a grid where the sums of numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are all equal. The grid given is a 3x3 magic square, and some of the cells are filled with expressions involving the variable n. My task is to find the value of n.

First, let me try to visualize the magic square based on the Asymptote code provided. It seems like the grid is divided into 3 rows and 3 columns, with each cell labeled as follows:

- First row (top row): The first cell is labeled ""n-3"", the second cell is ""3"", and the third cell is ""n+1"".
- Second row: The first cell is ""n+2"", the second cell is ""2n-9"", and the third cell is ""1"".
- Third row (bottom row): The first cell is ""2"", the second cell is ""n"", and the third cell is ""n-1"".

So, if I write this out in a grid format, it looks like this:

```
n-3 | 3 | n+1
n+2 | 2n-9 | 1
2 | n | n-1
```

Now, since it's a magic square, all rows, columns, and the two main diagonals must add up to the same number. Let's denote this common sum as S.

My plan is to set up equations based on the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals, and then solve for n.

Let me start by writing the equations for each row:

1. First row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = S
2. Second row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = S
3. Third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = S

Similarly, for the columns:

1. First column: (n - 3) + (n + 2) + 2 = S
2. Second column: 3 + (2n - 9) + n = S
3. Third column: (n + 1) + 1 + (n - 1) = S

And for the diagonals:

1. Main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right): (n - 3) + (2n - 9) + (n - 1) = S
2. Other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left): (n + 1) + (2n - 9) + 2 = S

Now, let's compute each of these expressions step by step.

Starting with the rows:

1. First row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
2. Second row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
3. Third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1

So, from the rows, we have:

- First row sum: 2n + 1 = S
- Second row sum: 3n - 6 = S
- Third row sum: 2n + 1 = S

Since all rows must equal S, we can set the first row equal to the second row:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6

Solving for n:

2n + 1 = 3n - 6  
Subtract 2n from both sides:  
1 = n - 6  
Add 6 to both sides:  
n = 7

Wait, hold on. Let me check if this is consistent with the third row. If n = 7, then the third row sum is 2*7 + 1 = 15. Let me verify the second row: 3*7 - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15. So, yes, both rows give S = 15. So n = 7 seems to satisfy the row conditions.

But let me not stop here. I should check the columns and diagonals as well to make sure that n = 7 is consistent throughout.

Let's compute the column sums with n = 7:

1. First column: (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
2. Second column: 3 + (2*7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
3. Third column: (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15

All columns sum to 15, which is consistent.

Now, the diagonals:

1. Main diagonal: (7 - 3) + (2*7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + (14 - 9) + 6 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
2. Other diagonal: (7 + 1) + (2*7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + (14 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Both diagonals also sum to 15. So, n = 7 satisfies all the conditions.

Wait, but let me double-check my initial equations because sometimes when setting up equations, especially with multiple variables, it's easy to make a mistake.

Looking back at the first row: (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1. That seems correct.

Second row: (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6. Correct.

Third row: 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2n + 1. Correct.

So, setting 2n + 1 = 3n - 6 gives n = 7, which is consistent across all rows, columns, and diagonals.

Just to be thorough, let me plug n = 7 back into the grid and see if all the numbers make sense.

First row: 7 - 3 = 4, 3, 7 + 1 = 8. So, 4, 3, 8. Sum is 15.

Second row: 7 + 2 = 9, 2*7 - 9 = 14 - 9 = 5, 1. So, 9, 5, 1. Sum is 15.

Third row: 2, 7, 7 - 1 = 6. So, 2, 7, 6. Sum is 15.

Columns:

First column: 4, 9, 2. Sum is 15.

Second column: 3, 5, 7. Sum is 15.

Third column: 8, 1, 6. Sum is 15.

Diagonals:

4, 5, 6. Sum is 15.

8, 5, 2. Sum is 15.

Everything checks out. So, n = 7 is indeed the correct value.

I think that's solid. I don't see any mistakes in my calculations, and all the sums are consistent when n = 7. So, I'm confident that n is 7.

**Final Answer**
The value of \( n \) is \boxed{7}.
</think>

Given a 3x3 magic square where the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and both main diagonals are equal, we need to find the value of \( n \).

The magic square is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We denote the common sum as \( S \).

First, we calculate the sums of each row:

1. First row: \( (n - 3) + 3 + (n + 1) = 2n + 1 \)
2. Second row: \( (n + 2) + (2n - 9) + 1 = 3n - 6 \)
3. Third row: \( 2 + n + (n - 1) = 2n + 1 \)

Since all rows must equal \( S \), we set the first row equal to the second row:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \\
1 = n - 6 \\
n = 7
\]

We verify this value by checking the sums of the columns and diagonals with \( n = 7 \):

1. First column: \( (7 - 3) + (7 + 2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
2. Second column: \( 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
3. Third column: \( (7 + 1) + 1 + (7 - 1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

For the diagonals:

1. Main diagonal: \( (7 - 3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7 - 1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
2. Other diagonal: \( (7 + 1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

All sums are consistent with \( S = 15 \). Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Okay, so I have this problem where ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. I need to find all possible values of the expression 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Hmm, let me think about how to approach this.

First, I remember that ω³ = 1 means that ω is a cube root of unity. There are three cube roots of unity: 1, ω, and ω². But since ω³ = 1, and we're dealing with complex numbers, ω can't be 1 because that would make the denominators in the expression undefined (since 1 + 1 = 2, which is fine, but wait, actually, if ω is 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But maybe ω is not 1? Or is it allowed? Let me check.

Wait, the problem says ω is a complex number such that ω³ = 1. So ω can be 1, ω, or ω². But if ω is 1, then the expression becomes 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. But I think the problem is more interesting if ω is a primitive cube root of unity, meaning ω ≠ 1. So maybe I should consider ω and ω² as the non-trivial roots.

But let me not assume that. Let me consider all three cases.

Case 1: ω = 1. Then the expression is 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1.

Case 2: ω is a primitive cube root of unity, so ω ≠ 1. Then ω² is the other primitive root. So let's compute the expression for ω and ω².

But wait, maybe I can find a general expression without plugging in specific values. Let me try to manipulate the expression algebraically.

Let me denote S = 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²). Let's combine the fractions:

S = [ (1 + ω²) + (1 + ω) ] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]

Simplify the numerator: 1 + ω² + 1 + ω = 2 + ω + ω².

Now, the denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. But since ω³ = 1, this becomes 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω².

So S = (2 + ω + ω²) / (2 + ω + ω²) = 1.

Wait, that's interesting. So regardless of whether ω is 1 or not, as long as ω³ = 1, the expression S equals 1. But wait, if ω = 1, then the denominator in each term is 2, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1, which matches. If ω is a primitive root, then the same calculation applies.

But wait, let me double-check. If ω is a primitive cube root of unity, then 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Because the sum of all cube roots of unity is zero. So 1 + ω + ω² = 0. Therefore, in the numerator and denominator, 2 + ω + ω² = 2 + (-1) = 1, because 1 + ω + ω² = 0 implies ω + ω² = -1. So 2 + (-1) = 1.

Wait, so if I substitute that, the numerator is 1 and the denominator is 1, so S = 1. But that contradicts my earlier thought that if ω is 1, S is 1, and if ω is a primitive root, S is also 1. So regardless of which cube root of unity ω is, the expression S is always 1.

But wait, let me check with ω = 1. If ω = 1, then 1/(1 + 1) + 1/(1 + 1) = 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. If ω is a primitive root, say ω = e^(2πi/3), then 1 + ω = 1 + e^(2πi/3), and 1 + ω² = 1 + e^(4πi/3). Let me compute 1/(1 + ω) + 1/(1 + ω²).

Alternatively, maybe I can compute it numerically. Let me compute 1 + ω and 1 + ω².

Let ω = e^(2πi/3) = cos(2π/3) + i sin(2π/3) = -1/2 + i√3/2.

So 1 + ω = 1 + (-1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Similarly, ω² = e^(4πi/3) = cos(4π/3) + i sin(4π/3) = -1/2 - i√3/2.

So 1 + ω² = 1 + (-1/2 - i√3/2) = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Now, compute 1/(1 + ω) = 1/(1/2 + i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

(1) * (1/2 - i√3/2) / [(1/2 + i√3/2)(1/2 - i√3/2)] = (1/2 - i√3/2) / (1/4 + 3/4) = (1/2 - i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 - i√3/2.

Similarly, 1/(1 + ω²) = 1/(1/2 - i√3/2). Multiply numerator and denominator by the conjugate:

(1) * (1/2 + i√3/2) / [(1/2 - i√3/2)(1/2 + i√3/2)] = (1/2 + i√3/2)/1 = 1/2 + i√3/2.

Now, add them together: (1/2 - i√3/2) + (1/2 + i√3/2) = 1/2 + 1/2 + (-i√3/2 + i√3/2) = 1 + 0 = 1.

So yes, it works out to 1. Therefore, regardless of whether ω is 1 or a primitive cube root of unity, the expression equals 1.

Wait, but if ω = 1, then 1 + ω = 2, and 1 + ω² = 2 as well, so 1/2 + 1/2 = 1. So in all cases, the expression is 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.

But wait, the problem says ""vnesite vse možne vrednosti, ločene z vejicami."" So I need to list all possible values, separated by commas. But in this case, it's only 1. So the answer is 1.

Wait, but let me think again. Is there any case where the expression could be different? For example, if ω is 1, it's 1. If ω is a primitive root, it's also 1. So yes, only 1 is possible.

Alternatively, maybe I made a mistake in the algebraic manipulation. Let me go back.

I had S = [2 + ω + ω²] / [ (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) ]

But since ω³ = 1, and 1 + ω + ω² = 0, so ω + ω² = -1.

Therefore, numerator is 2 + (-1) = 1.

Denominator: (1 + ω)(1 + ω²) = 1 + ω + ω² + ω³ = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.

Wait, that's not right. Wait, 1 + ω + ω² + ω³. Since ω³ = 1, this is 1 + ω + ω² + 1 = 2 + ω + ω². But ω + ω² = -1, so 2 + (-1) = 1. So denominator is 1.

Therefore, S = 1/1 = 1.

Yes, that's correct. So regardless of ω, as long as ω³ = 1, the expression is 1.

Therefore, the only possible value is 1.
</think>

The expression simplifies to 1 for all cube roots of unity ω. Therefore, the only possible value is:

"Okay, so I have this problem where I need to find the shortest possible distance I can travel starting from any of the points A, B, C, or D, and visiting the other three points exactly once. The figure is drawn with Asymptote, and it shows a network of points connected by lines with specific lengths. Let me try to visualize it based on the code.

From the Asymptote code, I can see that the points are A, B, C, and D. The connections and their lengths are as follows:

- D is connected to B with a length of 3.
- A is connected to B with a length of 6.
- A is connected to C with a length of 6.
- D is connected to C with a length of 4.
- A is connected to D with a length of 5.
- C is connected to B with a length of 5.

So, let me list all the connections and their lengths:

- A-B: 6
- A-C: 6
- A-D: 5
- B-C: 5
- B-D: 3
- C-D: 4

I think the figure is a complete graph with four nodes, meaning each point is connected to every other point. So, each point has three connections. Now, the problem is to find the shortest path that starts at any point and visits all four points exactly once. This is essentially finding the shortest Hamiltonian path in the graph.

Wait, but the problem says ""obiščete ostale tri točke enkrat,"" which translates to ""visit the other three points once."" So, starting from any point, I need to visit the other three exactly once, and the path should be as short as possible.

So, it's a traveling salesman problem but only visiting each city once, not necessarily returning to the start. So, it's a Hamiltonian path problem, and we need the shortest one.

Since it's a small graph with four nodes, I can list all possible paths starting from each node and calculate their total lengths, then pick the shortest one.

Let me list all possible starting points and their possible paths.

Starting from A:

1. A -> B -> C -> D
2. A -> B -> D -> C
3. A -> C -> B -> D
4. A -> C -> D -> B
5. A -> D -> B -> C
6. A -> D -> C -> B

Similarly, starting from B:

1. B -> A -> C -> D
2. B -> A -> D -> C
3. B -> C -> A -> D
4. B -> C -> D -> A
5. B -> D -> A -> C
6. B -> D -> C -> A

Starting from C:

1. C -> A -> B -> D
2. C -> A -> D -> B
3. C -> B -> A -> D
4. C -> B -> D -> A
5. C -> D -> A -> B
6. C -> D -> B -> A

Starting from D:

1. D -> A -> B -> C
2. D -> A -> C -> B
3. D -> B -> A -> C
4. D -> B -> C -> A
5. D -> C -> A -> B
6. D -> C -> B -> A

That's a lot of paths, 24 in total. But maybe I can find a smarter way without calculating all of them.

Alternatively, since the graph is small, I can compute the total distance for each possible path and find the minimum.

Let me start by calculating the distances for each path starting from A.

1. A -> B -> C -> D:
   A to B: 6
   B to C: 5
   C to D: 4
   Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

2. A -> B -> D -> C:
   A to B: 6
   B to D: 3
   D to C: 4
   Total: 6 + 3 + 4 = 13

3. A -> C -> B -> D:
   A to C: 6
   C to B: 5
   B to D: 3
   Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

4. A -> C -> D -> B:
   A to C: 6
   C to D: 4
   D to B: 3
   Total: 6 + 4 + 3 = 13

5. A -> D -> B -> C:
   A to D: 5
   D to B: 3
   B to C: 5
   Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

6. A -> D -> C -> B:
   A to D: 5
   D to C: 4
   C to B: 5
   Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

So, starting from A, the shortest path is 13, achieved by paths 2, 4, and 5.

Now, let's do the same for starting from B.

1. B -> A -> C -> D:
   B to A: 6
   A to C: 6
   C to D: 4
   Total: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16

2. B -> A -> D -> C:
   B to A: 6
   A to D: 5
   D to C: 4
   Total: 6 + 5 + 4 = 15

3. B -> C -> A -> D:
   B to C: 5
   C to A: 6
   A to D: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

4. B -> C -> D -> A:
   B to C: 5
   C to D: 4
   D to A: 5
   Total: 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

5. B -> D -> A -> C:
   B to D: 3
   D to A: 5
   A to C: 6
   Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

6. B -> D -> C -> A:
   B to D: 3
   D to C: 4
   C to A: 6
   Total: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

So, starting from B, the shortest path is 13, achieved by path 6.

Now, starting from C.

1. C -> A -> B -> D:
   C to A: 6
   A to B: 6
   B to D: 3
   Total: 6 + 6 + 3 = 15

2. C -> A -> D -> B:
   C to A: 6
   A to D: 5
   D to B: 3
   Total: 6 + 5 + 3 = 14

3. C -> B -> A -> D:
   C to B: 5
   B to A: 6
   A to D: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

4. C -> B -> D -> A:
   C to B: 5
   B to D: 3
   D to A: 5
   Total: 5 + 3 + 5 = 13

5. C -> D -> A -> B:
   C to D: 4
   D to A: 5
   A to B: 6
   Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

6. C -> D -> B -> A:
   C to D: 4
   D to B: 3
   B to A: 6
   Total: 4 + 3 + 6 = 13

So, starting from C, the shortest path is 13, achieved by paths 4 and 6.

Finally, starting from D.

1. D -> A -> B -> C:
   D to A: 5
   A to B: 6
   B to C: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

2. D -> A -> C -> B:
   D to A: 5
   A to C: 6
   C to B: 5
   Total: 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

3. D -> B -> A -> C:
   D to B: 3
   B to A: 6
   A to C: 6
   Total: 3 + 6 + 6 = 15

4. D -> B -> C -> A:
   D to B: 3
   B to C: 5
   C to A: 6
   Total: 3 + 5 + 6 = 14

5. D -> C -> A -> B:
   D to C: 4
   C to A: 6
   A to B: 6
   Total: 4 + 6 + 6 = 16

6. D -> C -> B -> A:
   D to C: 4
   C to B: 5
   B to A: 6
   Total: 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

So, starting from D, the shortest path is 14, achieved by path 4.

Now, compiling all the shortest paths from each starting point:

- From A: 13
- From B: 13
- From C: 13
- From D: 14

So, the overall shortest path is 13.

Wait, but let me double-check if I didn't make a mistake in any of the calculations.

Looking back at starting from A, path 2: A->B->D->C: 6+3+4=13. Correct.

Starting from B, path 6: B->D->C->A: 3+4+6=13. Correct.

Starting from C, path 4: C->B->D->A: 5+3+5=13. Correct.

Starting from D, the shortest is 14, which is longer.

So, the minimal total distance is 13.

But wait, is there a way to get shorter than 13? Let me think.

Is there a way to have a path that uses some other connections? For example, maybe going through D more than once? But no, the problem says to visit each point exactly once, so we can't revisit any node.

Alternatively, maybe I missed a path? Let me check.

Wait, in the starting from A, path 2: A->B->D->C: 6+3+4=13.

Is there a way to go from A to D first, then to B, then to C? That's A->D->B->C: 5+3+5=13 as well.

Similarly, A->D->C->B: 5+4+5=14.

So, yes, 13 is the minimal.

Similarly, starting from B, the path B->D->C->A: 3+4+6=13.

Starting from C, the path C->B->D->A:5+3+5=13.

So, all these paths give 13.

Therefore, the minimal distance is 13.

Wait, but let me check if there's a path that goes through D twice? No, because we can't visit D twice.

Alternatively, is there a way to have a shorter path by choosing different edges? For example, from A to D is 5, which is shorter than A to B or A to C.

But in the path A->D->B->C, we have 5+3+5=13.

Alternatively, A->D->C->B: 5+4+5=14.

So, 13 is better.

Similarly, starting from B, going to D first is better because B->D is 3, which is shorter than B->A or B->C.

So, B->D->C->A: 3+4+6=13.

Same with starting from C: C->B->D->A:5+3+5=13.

So, all these paths give 13.

Therefore, the minimal distance is 13.

I think that's the answer.
</think>

The shortest possible distance is achieved by several paths, each starting from a different point and totaling 13 units. Therefore, the minimal distance is \boxed{13}.","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
