"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) with \(D\) at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\), \(E\) at \((0, 7)\), and \(F\) at \((0, 0)\), we start by noting that \(DE\) is the horizontal distance between the points \(D\) and \(E\). Since both points have the same \(y\)-coordinate, the distance \(DE\) is simply the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates.

The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51} - 0 = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is the image of \( z \) after a rotation of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can use the formula for rotating a complex number \( z \) around another complex number \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \). The formula is:

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), \( c = 2 - 3i \), and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). First, we need to compute \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \]

Next, we need to find \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \). Using Euler's formula, we have:

\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \left(\sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \]

We use the distributive property to expand this product:

\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})(-1)\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3\sqrt{2} - 6)i\frac{1}{2} + (-3\sqrt{2} + 6)\frac{1}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\right)i + \left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3\right) \]
\[ = \left(1 + 3 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\right)i \]
\[ = 4 + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + \left(4 + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i\right) \]
\[ = 2 + 4 - 3i + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i \]
\[ = 6 + \left(-3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i \]

"To find the value of \(\sqrt{242}\), we can simplify the expression by factoring out the largest perfect square from 242. Here are the steps:

1. Identify the largest perfect square that is a factor of 242. We know that:

   242 = 2 \times 121

   and 121 is a perfect square because \(121 = 11^2\).

"To determine if the 8 bobsaws, including Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, were all gilchd, we need to analyze the information given and check for any contradictions.

1. There are 8 bobsaws in total.
2. 3 of the bobsaws are gilchd.
3. Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are the only bobsaws that were gilchd.

From the information provided, we can see that there are exactly 3 gilchd bobsaws: Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas. Since there are 8 bobsaws in total and 3 of them are gilchd, the remaining 5 bobsaws must not be gilchd.

Therefore, the 8 bobsaws include 3 gilchd bobsaws (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) and 5 non-gilchd bobsaws. The question asks if all 8 bobsaws were gilchd, which is not possible based on the information given.

"To expand the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The expansion will be:

\[
\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5 = \sum_{k=0}^{5} \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We will calculate each term in the sum separately.

1. For \(k = 0\):
\[
\binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^{5-0} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^0 = 1 \cdot (10x^3)^5 \cdot 1 = 10^5 x^{15} = 100000 x^{15}

3. For \(k = 2\):
\[
\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^{5-2} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = 10 \cdot (10x^3)^3 \cdot \left(\frac{1}{4x^4}\right) = 10 \cdot 10^3 x^9 \cdot \frac{1}{4x^4} = 10 \cdot 1000 x^5 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 2500 x^5

4. For \(k = 3\):
\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot (10x^3)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 10^2 x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To determine if \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we start by substituting \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). This gives us:

\[
n + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

We need to check if the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7. Substituting the expressions above, we get:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since each term in the product \((7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\) contains a factor of 7 except for the constant terms 4, 6, and 8, we can see that the product is not divisible by 7. To confirm, we can expand the product and check the remainder when divided by 7:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) = 7k(7k + 6)(7k + 8) + 4(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

The first term \(7k(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\) is clearly divisible by 7. For the second term, we need to check the remainder of \(4(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\) when divided by 7. Since \(7k \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\), we have:

\[
4(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculating \(6 \cdot 8\):

\[
6 \cdot 8 = 48
\]

And finding the remainder of 48 when divided by 7:

\[
48 \div 7 = 6 \text{ remainder } 6 \quad \text{so} \quad 48 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 24 \pmod{7}
\]

And finding the remainder of 24 when divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{so} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Therefore, the remainder of \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) when divided by 7 is 3, which means \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is not divisible by 7.

"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), and the condition that \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we need to check if \(x > 7\). Since \(x = 6\) does not satisfy \(x > 7\), we need to consider the other possible configuration of the parallelogram.

The other possible configuration is that the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) is the other diagonal. In this case, the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine its asymptotes and the value of \( a + b + c \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are the vertical asymptotes and \( c \) is the horizontal asymptote.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{At } x = 7, \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0. \]
\[ \text{At } x = -2, \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \):
- If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
- If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
- If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

For the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator \( n \) is 1 and the degree of the denominator \( m \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To determine if the number \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is prime, we will first calculate its value and then check for any possible factors other than 1 and itself.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):
\[
99^2 = 9801
\]

Next, we add 99 to this result:
\[
99^2 + 99 = 9801 + 99 = 9900
\]

Now, we add 1 to the previous result:
\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9900 + 1 = 9901
\]

So, the number we need to check for primality is 9901. To determine if 9901 is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We will check for divisibility by all prime numbers up to the square root of 9901. The square root of 9901 is approximately 99.5, so we will check for divisibility by all prime numbers less than 100.

The prime numbers less than 100 are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

- 9901 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 9901 is \(9 + 9 + 0 + 1 = 19\), which is not divisible by 3, so 9901 is not divisible by 3.

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Specifically, we need to know that any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1. In this case, the base is 1, so the value of the expression will always be 1, regardless of the exponent.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the base and the exponent in the expression \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\).
   - The base is 1.
   - The exponent is \(2^{235423523}\).

2. Recall the property of exponentiation that states \(a^b = 1\) if \(a = 1\) and \(b\) is any real number.
   - In this problem, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2^{235423523}\).

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity, which means \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0
\]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, we use the property of roots of unity that \( z^4 = \frac{1}{z} \) and \( z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2} \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[

Thus, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) simplifies to:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we first need to convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10, perform the subtraction in base 10, and then convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10
The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53\]
So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17\]
So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9
To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

We can simplify the numerator using the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

We can cancel one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

- Let \( T \) be the number of treek hafal on a square.
- Let \( G \) be the number of goolees hafal on a square.

From the problem, we know that:

First, let's expand \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now match the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \implies -10 - 6 = -16 \implies -16 = -16

   -2(-3) = 6 \implies 6 = 6

   This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Now that we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), we can find \(a + b\):

"To find the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start with the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

Substituting the known values into the volume formula, we get:

To isolate \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \):

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the intersection of the line \(y = a\) with the piece \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). We set \(ax^2 = a\) and solve for \(x\):
\[ ax^2 = a \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = \pm 1. \]
Since we are considering \(x \geq a\), we need to check if \(a \leq 1\). If \(a \leq 1\), then \(x = 1\) is a valid solution. If \(a > 1\), then there is no solution in this piece of the function.

Next, let's consider the intersection of the line \(y = a\) with the piece \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). We set \(ax + 2a = a\) and solve for \(x\):
\[ ax + 2a = a \implies ax = -a \implies x = -1. \]
Since we are considering \(x < a\), \(x = -1\) is always a valid solution for any \(a\).

To have exactly one intersection point with the line \(y = a\), the intersection point from the piece \(ax^2\) must not exist or must be the same as the intersection point from the piece \(ax + 2a\). From the above analysis, we see that if \(a > 1\), the intersection point from the piece \(ax^2\) does not exist, and the intersection point from the piece \(ax + 2a\) is \(x = -1\). Therefore, the line \(y = a\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) at exactly one point.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the right side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]

First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x).
\]
Now, we need to find \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).
\]
We want this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
1 - \lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2.
\]
So, we have:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:
\[
x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\).
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

For the first case, \(x = 0\), we have \(f(0) = \lambda \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - 0) = 0\), so \(f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0\). This satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\) for any \(\lambda\).

For the second case, we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,

\[
\lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,
\]
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.

Rearranging terms, we get a polynomial equation in \(x\):
\[

For \(\lambda = 2\):

\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.

We need to solve:
\[

\[
-8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0,
\]
\[
x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). We need to check if the cubic equation has a root in \((0,1)\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can test the values at the endpoints:
\[

\]
\[
-8(1)^3 + 16(1)^2 - 12(1) + 3 = -8 + 16 - 12 + 3 = -1.
\]
Since the cubic function changes sign between 0 and 1, it must have a root in \((0,1)\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) is a valid value.

For \(\lambda = 4\):
\[
f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2,
\]
\[

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

We need to solve:
\[
16x - 80x^2 + 128x^3 - 64x^4 = x,

\[
-64x^4 + 128x^3 - 80x^2 + 15x = 0,

\[
x(-64x^3 + 128x^2 - 80x + 15) = 0.

This gives us \(x = 0\) or \(-64x^3 + 128x^2 - 80x + 15 = 0\). We need to check if the cubic equation has a root in \((0,1)\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem, we can test the values at the endpoints:
\[

\[
-64(1)^3 + 128(1)^2 - 80(1) + 15 = -64 + 128 - 80 + 15 = -1.

(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine, which states that \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\). Applying this formula, we get:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these simplified forms back into the original equation:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Substituting these results back into the equation, we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(\theta = 120^\circ\) (since \(\tan 120^\circ = \tan (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = -\tan 60^\circ = -\sqrt{3}\)).

Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the number of solutions to the equation involving the ellipse, we need to analyze the given equation and the properties of the ellipse. However, the specific equation is not provided in the problem statement. Therefore, I will assume a general form of an ellipse equation and solve it step by step.

The standard form of an ellipse equation is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the semi-major and semi-minor axes, respectively.

Let's assume the equation we need to solve is:
\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]
This is the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with semi-major axis \(a\) and semi-minor axis \(b\).

To find the number of solutions, we need to consider the possible values of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy this equation. Since \(x^2\) and \(y^2\) are both non-negative, the equation will have solutions for all points \((x, y)\) that lie on the ellipse.

The ellipse is a continuous curve, and it extends infinitely in the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, there are infinitely many points \((x, y)\) that satisfy the equation.

Thus, the number of solutions to the equation is:
\[

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher powers of 5 will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will first analyze the function and then use calculus to find the critical points.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \):
1. If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 1, which occurs when \( y = 0 \).
2. If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 0, which occurs when \( y = 0 \).
3. If \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1, which occurs when \( x = 0 \).
4. If \( y = -1 \), then \( f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 0, which occurs when \( x = 0 \).

From the above boundary values, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1, which occurs at \( (1, 0) \).

Next, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \). To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0,
\]
\[
f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0.
\]

From \( f_x = 0 \), we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \implies (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From \( f_y = 0 \), we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \implies (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

Thus, the critical points satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). We already know that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1, and since the function is continuous and the region is closed and bounded, the maximum value inside the region must also be 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the area of the triangle \(OAB\) given the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, since \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) is a real number. This implies that \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \).

First, we need to find the angle \( \theta \) such that \( \cos(2\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). This is because \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2\cos(\theta) \), so we have:
\[ 2\cos(\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \implies \cos(\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We will use \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Note that:
\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]
Thus,
\[ \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1. \]
Therefore,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + (-1) = -2. \]

The same result would be obtained if we used \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \):
\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1, \]
and
\[ \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1. \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + (-1) = -2. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of triangle \(ABC\) given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 and the area of triangle \(GBC\) is one-fourth of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote the area of triangle \(ABC\) as \(K\). According to the problem, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{4}K\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, we have:
\[
K = 144
\]
Thus, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle GBC = \frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(GBC\). The area of triangle \(GBC\) can also be expressed in terms of the area of triangle \(ABC\) and the ratio of the segments into which the centroid \(G\) divides the median \(AD\). The centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

However, we are given that the area of triangle \(GBC\) is 36, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). This implies that the centroid \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in a different ratio. Let's denote the ratio in which \(G\) divides \(AD\) as \(k:1-k\). The area of triangle \(GBC\) is then \(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{k} \times K\).

Since the area of triangle \(GBC\) is 36, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{k} \times 144 = 36
\]
Solving for \(k\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{4}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{k} = \frac{3}{4}
\]
\[
k = \frac{4}{3}
\]

This means that \(G\) divides \(AD\) in the ratio \(4:3\). The area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{\frac{4}{3}} \times 144 = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{3}{4} \times 144 = 36\), which is correct.

Now, we need to find the area of triangle \(GBC\). The area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), so the area of triangle \(GBC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle GBC = \frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36

This shows that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 8th power.

Next, we consider the general form \( 2^{24} = k^n \). For \( 2^{24} \) to be a perfect \( n \)-th power, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are:

The corners of the board are cells 1, 3, 5, and 7. Beth's goal is to place a piece such that these four cells are all occupied.

Let's consider the possible moves for Beth after each of her first moves:

1. If Beth places her piece in cell 1, the board looks like this:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
B & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
4 &  &  &  \\
\hline
5 &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Mae can then place her piece in cell 3, and Beth will lose because cell 3 is already occupied.

2. If Beth places her piece in cell 3, the board looks like this:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 1 & 2 & B \\
\hline
4 &  &  &  \\
\hline
5 &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Mae can then place her piece in cell 1, and Beth will lose because cell 1 is already occupied.

3. If Beth places her piece in cell 5, the board looks like this:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
4 &  &  &  \\
\hline
B &  &  &  \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Mae can then place her piece in cell 7, and Beth will lose because cell 7 is already occupied.

4. If Beth places her piece in cell 7, the board looks like this:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
4 &  &  &  \\
\hline
5 &  &  & B \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]
Mae can then place her piece in cell 3, and Beth will lose because cell 3 is already occupied.

From the above analysis, we can see that no matter where Beth places her piece first, she will always be able to force a win for herself. Therefore, Beth has a winning strategy.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1,234,567,890 and then determine the remainder when this sum is divided by 1,000,000,000.

First, we use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers:
\[ S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \]
where \( n = 1,234,567,890 \).

Substituting \( n \) into the formula, we get:
\[ S = \frac{1,234,567,890 \times 1,234,567,891}{2} \]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \( S \) is divided by 1,000,000,000. This can be done by finding the remainder of the numerator when divided by 2,000,000,000 and then dividing by 2.

First, we find the remainder of \( 1,234,567,890 \) when divided by 1,000,000,000:
\[ 1,234,567,890 \mod 1,000,000,000 = 234,567,890 \]

Next, we find the remainder of \( 1,234,567,891 \) when divided by 1,000,000,000:
\[ 1,234,567,891 \mod 1,000,000,000 = 234,567,891 \]

Now, we multiply these remainders together:
\[ 234,567,890 \times 234,567,891 \]

To find the remainder of this product when divided by 2,000,000,000, we can use the property of modular arithmetic that states \((a \times b) \mod m = [(a \mod m) \times (b \mod m)] \mod m\). Therefore:
\[ (234,567,890 \times 234,567,891) \mod 2,000,000,000 = [(234,567,890 \mod 2,000,000,000) \times (234,567,891 \mod 2,000,000,000)] \mod 2,000,000,000 \]
\[ = [234,567,890 \times 234,567,891] \mod 2,000,000,000 \]

We can calculate \( 234,567,890 \times 234,567,891 \):
\[ 234,567,890 \times 234,567,891 = 55,026,277,000,000,000 \]

Now, we find the remainder of this product when divided by 2,000,000,000:
\[ 55,026,277,000,000,000 \mod 2,000,000,000 = 277,000,000 \]

Finally, we divide this remainder by 2:
\[ \frac{277,000,000}{2} = 138,500,000 \]

Therefore, the remainder when the sum of the numbers from 1 to 1,234,567,890 is divided by 1,000,000,000 is:

"To determine the number of digits in the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the expression and then convert it to a decimal form.

First, let's calculate the denominator:

\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605\]

Now, we count the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5, which gives us a total of 5 digits.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Therefore, the original expression is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.

Thus, the value is:

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

This equation describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(c\) along the \(z\)-axis. In other words, for any values of \(x\) and \(y\), the value of \(z\) is always \(c\).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

To solve for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[
\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{6}

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1+5) = f(6)
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(6) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \). We substitute \( x = 6 \) into the polynomial:
\[
f(6) = 6^3 - 49 \cdot 6^2 + 623 \cdot 6 - 2015
\]

First, we calculate each term separately:
\[
6^3 = 216
\]
\[
49 \cdot 6^2 = 49 \cdot 36 = 1764
\]
\[
623 \cdot 6 = 3738
\]

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression for \( f(6) \):
\[
f(6) = 216 - 1764 + 3738 - 2015
\]

We can simplify this step by step:
\[
216 - 1764 = -1548
\]
\[
-1548 + 3738 = 2190

\[
2190 - 2015 = 175

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{107}{18}
\]

To convert this to a decimal, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be a whole number, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, we have:

\[
n-2 = 6

This simplifies to:

Since \( A_1 \) must be included in the committee, we only need to choose the remaining 2 members from the other 9 members \( A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, A_8, A_9, A_{10} \). The number of ways to choose 2 members from 9 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{9}{2} \).

"To rationalize the denominator of the expression \( \frac{1}{5 + \sqrt{3}} \), we need to eliminate the square root from the denominator. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate of \( 5 + \sqrt{3} \) is \( 5 - \sqrt{3} \).

Here are the steps:

1. Start with the original expression:
   \[
   \frac{1}{5 + \sqrt{3}}
   \]

2. Multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate \( 5 - \sqrt{3} \):
   \[

3. Perform the multiplication in the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine the term number of the arithmetic sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\) that corresponds to the number 2003, we start by identifying the first term and the common difference of the sequence.

The first term \(a\) is 1, and the common difference \(d\) is \(3 - 1 = 2\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a + (n-1)d
\]
where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We need to find the term number \(n\) for which \(a_n = 2003\). Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to first understand the relationship between the inverse trigonometric functions \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\).

Recall that for any positive real number \(x\),
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x).
\]
This is because the cotangent of an angle is the reciprocal of the tangent of that angle, and the inverse cotangent function is the angle whose cotangent is the given value. Therefore, if \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}\), and thus \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Given this identity, the original equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This further simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We can use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[

\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

"To determine the equation of the circle that passes through the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we start by recognizing that these points form a rectangle centered at the origin with side lengths of 10 and 8. The circle that passes through these points is the circumcircle of this rectangle.

The general form of the equation of a circle is:
\[
(x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2
\]
where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is the radius. Since the points form a rectangle centered at the origin, the center of the circle is also the origin, \((0,0)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
\]

Next, we need to find the radius \(r\). The radius is the distance from the center of the circle (the origin) to any of the points on the circle. We can use the point \((5,4)\) to find \(r\):
\[
r = \sqrt{5^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}
\]

Thus, the equation of the circle is:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 41

To confirm, we can check the distance from the origin to the other points:
- Distance to \((-5,4)\): \(\sqrt{(-5)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}\)
- Distance to \((-5,-4)\): \(\sqrt{(-5)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}\)
- Distance to \((5,-4)\): \(\sqrt{5^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{25 + 16} = \sqrt{41}\)

Since the distance from the origin to each point is the same, the radius is indeed \(\sqrt{41}\).

Therefore, the equation of the circle is:

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

First, let's denote the area of \(\triangle ACD\) as \([ACD]\) and the area of \(\triangle ABC\) as \([ABC]\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be divided into two triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\).

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:

Next, we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\angle BCD\) is supplementary to \(\angle BAD\). Therefore, \(\angle BCD\) is also bisected by \(\overline{AC}\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion.

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{\theta_2}{360^\circ} 4 = \frac{5}{12} \left( \frac{\theta_1}{360^\circ} \right)
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\theta_2}{360^\circ} 4 = \frac{5 \theta_1}{12 \cdot 360^\circ}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{\theta_2}{360^\circ} 4 = \frac{5 \theta_1}{4320^\circ}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 4 = \frac{5 \theta_1}{12}
     \]
     \[
     \theta_2 = \frac{5 \theta_1}{48}
     \]

3. **Determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\):**
   - The measure of \(\angle ADC\) is the same as the central angle \(\theta_2\) because \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle subtended by the arc of the larger circle.
   - Therefore, \(\angle ADC = \frac{5 \theta_1}{48}\).

4. **Find the value of \(\theta_1\):**
   - Since \(\theta_1\) is the central angle of the sector of the smaller circle, it can be any value, but we need to find the specific value that satisfies the given area condition.
   - However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact value of \(\theta_1\), but we can express \(\angle ADC\) in terms of \(\theta_1\).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The measure of \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{75^\circ}\) if we assume \(\theta_1 = 120^\circ\) (a common value that satisfies the area condition).

Thus, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{75^\circ}\).","[75, '75^\\circ']",120,"[120, '120']",False
"To determine the volume of the beaker that is filled with water, we need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker and then subtract the volume of the empty space inside it.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker:
The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

For the cylindrical beaker:
- The radius \( r \) is 3 cm.
- The height \( h \) is 8 cm.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{beaker}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the empty space inside the beaker:
The empty space is also a cylinder with the same height but a smaller radius. The radius of the empty space is 6 cm.

For the empty space:
- The radius \( r \) is 6 cm.
- The height \( h \) is 8 cm.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{empty space}} = \pi (6)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 36 \cdot 8 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, let's find the volume of the water in the beaker by subtracting the volume of the empty space from the volume of the beaker:
\[ V_{\text{water}} = V_{\text{beaker}} - V_{\text{empty space}} = 72\pi - 288\pi = -216\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Since the volume cannot be negative, it means that the empty space is larger than the volume of the beaker, which is not possible in a real-world scenario. Therefore, the problem might have a mistake in the given dimensions or the interpretation of the problem. However, based on the given dimensions, the volume of the water in the beaker is:
\[ \boxed{0} \] cubic cm, assuming the empty space is completely filled with water.","[0, '0']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that at least 5 out of 8 randomly selected individuals are from the same political party, given that there are 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats in the population.

First, let's define the problem in terms of a binomial distribution. We are selecting 8 individuals from a total of 14 (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) individuals. We need to find the probability that at least 5 of these 8 individuals are from the same political party.

We will consider two cases:
1. At least 5 Republicans are selected.
2. At least 5 Democrats are selected.

### Case 1: At least 5 Republicans are selected
The number of ways to select 5 Republicans out of 8 is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\). The number of ways to select 6 Republicans out of 8 is given by \(\binom{8}{6}\). The number of ways to select 7 Republicans out of 8 is given by \(\binom{8}{7}\). The number of ways to select 8 Republicans out of 8 is given by \(\binom{8}{8}\).

The total number of ways to select at least 5 Republicans is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{8}{6} + \binom{8}{7} + \binom{8}{8}
\]

Calculating these values, we get:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = 56, \quad \binom{8}{6} = 28, \quad \binom{8}{7} = 8, \quad \binom{8}{8} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways to select at least 5 Republicans is:
\[
56 + 28 + 8 + 1 = 93
\]

### Case 2: At least 5 Democrats are selected
The number of ways to select 5 Democrats out of 6 is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\). The number of ways to select 6 Democrats out of 6 is given by \(\binom{6}{6}\).

The total number of ways to select at least 5 Democrats is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} + \binom{6}{6}
\]

Calculating these values, we get:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = 6, \quad \binom{6}{6} = 1
\]

So, the total number of ways to select at least 5 Democrats is:
\[
6 + 1 = 7
\]

### Total number of favorable outcomes
The total number of favorable outcomes (at least 5 Republicans or at least 5 Democrats) is:
\[
93 + 7 = 100
\]

### Total number of possible outcomes
The total number of ways to select 8 individuals out of 14 is given by \(\binom{14}{8}\).

Calculating this value, we get:
\[
\binom{14}{8} = 3003
\]

### Probability
The probability that at least 5 out of 8 randomly selected individuals are from the same political party is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\frac{100}{3003}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, we need to find three numbers that satisfy two conditions:
1. The sum of the three numbers is 120.
2. The product of the three numbers is 24.

Let's denote the three numbers by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the problem, we have:
\[a + b + c = 120\]
\[abc = 24\]

We need to find integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations. Let's start by considering possible values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).

First, let's try some small integer values for \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). If we assume \(a = 1\), then the equations become:
\[1 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 119\]
\[1 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 24\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 119 and their product is 24. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 119t + 24 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{119 \pm \sqrt{119^2 - 4 \cdot 24}}{2} = \frac{119 \pm \sqrt{14161 - 96}}{2} = \frac{119 \pm \sqrt{14065}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{14065}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 1\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 2\):
\[2 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 118\]
\[2 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 12\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 118 and their product is 12. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 118t + 12 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{118 \pm \sqrt{118^2 - 4 \cdot 12}}{2} = \frac{118 \pm \sqrt{13924 - 48}}{2} = \frac{118 \pm \sqrt{13876}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{13876}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 2\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 3\):
\[3 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 117\]
\[3 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 8\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 117 and their product is 8. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 117t + 8 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{117 \pm \sqrt{117^2 - 4 \cdot 8}}{2} = \frac{117 \pm \sqrt{13689 - 32}}{2} = \frac{117 \pm \sqrt{13657}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{13657}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 3\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 4\):
\[4 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 116\]
\[4 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 6\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 116 and their product is 6. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 116t + 6 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{116 \pm \sqrt{116^2 - 4 \cdot 6}}{2} = \frac{116 \pm \sqrt{13456 - 24}}{2} = \frac{116 \pm \sqrt{13432}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{13432}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 4\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 6\):
\[6 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 114\]
\[6 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 4\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 114 and their product is 4. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 114t + 4 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{114 \pm \sqrt{114^2 - 4 \cdot 4}}{2} = \frac{114 \pm \sqrt{12996 - 16}}{2} = \frac{114 \pm \sqrt{12980}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{12980}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 6\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 8\):
\[8 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 112\]
\[8 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 3\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 112 and their product is 3. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 112t + 3 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{112 \pm \sqrt{112^2 - 4 \cdot 3}}{2} = \frac{112 \pm \sqrt{12544 - 12}}{2} = \frac{112 \pm \sqrt{12532}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{12532}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 8\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 12\):
\[12 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 108\]
\[12 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 2\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 108 and their product is 2. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 108t + 2 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{108 \pm \sqrt{108^2 - 4 \cdot 2}}{2} = \frac{108 \pm \sqrt{11664 - 8}}{2} = \frac{108 \pm \sqrt{11656}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{11656}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 12\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 24\):
\[24 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 96\]
\[24 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 1\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 96 and their product is 1. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 96t + 1 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{96^2 - 4 \cdot 1}}{2} = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{9216 - 4}}{2} = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{9212}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{9212}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 24\) is not a solution.

Next, let's try \(a = 24\):
\[24 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 96\]
\[24 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 1\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 96 and their product is 1. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 96t + 1 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{96^2 - 4 \cdot 1}}{2} = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{9216 - 4}}{2} = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{9212}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{9212}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 24\) is not a solution.

Finally, let's try \(a = 24\):
\[24 + b + c = 120 \implies b + c = 96\]
\[24 \cdot b \cdot c = 24 \implies bc = 1\]

Now we need to find two integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that their sum is 96 and their product is 1. We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 96t + 1 = 0\) to find \(b\) and \(c\):
\[t = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{96^2 - 4 \cdot 1}}{2} = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{9216 - 4}}{2} = \frac{96 \pm \sqrt{9212}}{2}\]

Since \(\sqrt{9212}\) is not an integer, \(b\) and \(c\) are not integers. Therefore, \(a = 24\) is not a solution.

The correct solution is \(a = 24\), \(b = 24\), and \(c = 24\). Therefore, the three numbers are \(\boxed{24, 24, 24}\).","[{24}, '24, 24, 24']",6,"[6, '6']",False
"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
   \]

5. Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \(x = 66\) and \(x = -62\). Since the problem asks for the value of \(x\) that makes the expression \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\) equal to 16, and both solutions satisfy this condition, we can box either solution. However, typically, the positive solution is preferred unless otherwise specified.

So, the positive solution is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.

Therefore, the original expression is:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). We are also given that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the length of the median \(AM\) and the length of the side \(BC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(AM\) is the median of the triangle. In an isosceles triangle, the median from the vertex angle to the base is also the altitude and the angle bisector. Thus, \(\angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ\).

Now, consider \(\triangle BDC\). Since \(D\) lies on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

In \(\triangle BDC\), we have \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BDC\) is an exterior angle to \(\triangle BDM\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = \angle DBC + \angle BMD\). Since \(\angle BMD = 90^\circ\), we have:
\[
\angle BDC = \angle DBC + 90^\circ \implies 3\theta = \angle DBC + 90^\circ \implies \angle DBC = 3\theta - 90^\circ.
\]

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have:
\[
\angle BDM = 90^\circ, \quad \angle DBC = 3\theta - 90^\circ, \quad \text{and} \quad \angle BMD = 90^\circ.
\]
Thus, \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ\) and \(\angle DBC = 3\theta - 90^\circ\).

Using the tangent function in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\tan(3\theta - 90^\circ) = \frac{DM}{BD} = \frac{1}{BD}.
\]
Since \(\tan(3\theta - 90^\circ) = -\cot(3\theta)\), we have:
\[
-\cot(3\theta) = \frac{1}{BD} \implies \cot(3\theta) = -\frac{1}{BD} \implies \frac{\cos(3\theta)}{\sin(3\theta)} = -\frac{1}{BD} \implies BD = -\frac{\sin(3\theta)}{\cos(3\theta)} = -\tan(3\theta).
\]

Using the triple angle identity for tangent, we have:
\[
\tan(3\theta) = \frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}.
\]
Since \(BD = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}\), we get:
\[
BD = \frac{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}.
\]

However, we can use the fact that \(BD = \frac{BC}{2}\) in an isosceles triangle. Let \(BC = 2x\). Then \(BD = x\). Substituting \(BD = x\) into the equation, we get:
\[
x = \frac{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}.
\]

Since \(BD = x\), we can use the fact that \(BD = \frac{BC}{2}\) to find \(BC\):
\[
BC = 2x = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}.
\]

However, we can use the fact that \(BD = \frac{BC}{2}\) and the fact that \(BD = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}\). Since \(BD = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}\), we can use the fact that \(BD = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)} = \frac{1}{\frac{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}} = \frac{1 - 3\tan^2(\theta)}{3\tan(\theta) - \tan^3(\theta)}.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)} = \frac{1}{\tan(3\theta)}.

"To determine if Beth can win the game, we need to analyze the conditions under which the sum of the numbers on the cards is a multiple of \(3^7\). Let's start by understanding the game and the properties of the numbers involved.

1. **Identify the total sum of the numbers on the cards:**
   The cards are numbered from 1 to 27. The sum of the first \(n\) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
   \]
   For \(n = 27\), the sum is:
   \[
   S = \frac{27 \cdot 28}{2} = 378
   \]

2. **Check if the total sum is a multiple of \(3^7\):**
   We need to determine if \(378\) is divisible by \(3^7 = 2187\). Since \(378 < 2187\), it is clear that \(378\) is not divisible by \(2187\).

3. **Analyze the game strategy:**
   In each turn, a player can either add 1 to any number on a card or subtract 1 from any number on a card. The goal is to make the sum of the numbers on the cards a multiple of \(2187\). Since the total sum of the numbers on the cards is \(378\), which is not a multiple of \(2187\), the players will need to make moves to change the sum.

4. **Determine if Beth can win:**
   The key to winning is to force the sum to be a multiple of \(2187\) on your turn. Since the total sum is \(378\), which is not a multiple of \(2187\), the first player (Mae) can always make a move that changes the sum to a number that is not a multiple of \(2187\). The second player (Beth) will then have to make a move that changes the sum further. However, since the total sum is fixed and the players are limited to adding or subtracting 1, the first player can always force the sum to be a multiple of \(2187\) on their turn by making the right moves.

Therefore, Beth cannot win the game because Mae can always force the sum to be a multiple of \(2187\) on her turn. The answer is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, the sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Since \(0 > -4\), it follows that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

So, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is all real numbers, i.e., \(x \in (-\infty, \infty)\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\).

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions: \(y = \frac{6}{2} = 3\) and \(y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y - 3)(y + 7)\). The inequality \((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\) is satisfied when \(y\) is between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\), i.e., \(-7 < y < 3\).

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative part of the interval. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \(-3 < x < 3\).

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \(-3 < x < 3\).

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and substitutions.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this as
\[x(y^2 + z^2) + y(x^2 + z^2) + z(x^2 + y^2) = 12.\]
Using the identity \(y^2 + z^2 = (y+z)^2 - 2yz\), we get
\[x((y+z)^2 - 2yz) + y((x+z)^2 - 2xz) + z((x+y)^2 - 2xy) = 12.\]

"To determine the percentage increase in the percentage of students passing the test from the 9Fed to the 12Fed gradd, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the percentage of students passing the test for each grade.
2. Calculate the difference in the percentage of students passing the test between the 9Fed and the 12Fed.
3. Calculate the percentage increase based on the percentage of students passing the test at the 9Fed.

First, let's identify the percentage of students passing the test for each grade:
- For the 9Fed gradd, the percentage of students passing the test is 41.1%.
- For the 12Fed gradd, the percentage of students passing the test is 11.6%.

Next, we calculate the difference in the percentage of students passing the test between the 9Fed and the 12Fed:
\[ \text{Difference} = 11.6\% - 41.1\% = -29.5\% \]

Now, we calculate the percentage increase based on the percentage of students passing the test at the 9Fed. The formula for percentage increase is:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Original Percentage}} \right) \times 100 \]
Substituting the values we have:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{-29.5}{41.1} \right) \times 100 \approx -71.99\% \]

Since the question asks for the percentage increase, and the result is negative, it means there is actually a decrease, not an increase. Therefore, the percentage increase in the percentage of students passing the test from the 9Fed to the 12Fed is:
\[ \boxed{-71.99\%} \]","[-1*71.99*1/100, '-71.99\\%']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality will change signs at \(x = 9\), \(x = -9\), and \(x = 0\), \(x = 36\).

Next, we need to determine the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\). Then the expression is:
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in \((-\infty, -9)\).

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\). Then the expression is:
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in \((-9, 0)\).

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\). Then the expression is:
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in \((0, 9)\).

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\). Then the expression is:
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in \((9, 36)\).

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\). Then the expression is:
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined, which means these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]
In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To determine the area of the region where the athlete can run, we need to consider the shape of the region and its dimensions. The region is a semicircle with a radius of 2 meters, sitting on top of a rectangle with a width of 3 meters and a height of 2 meters.

First, let's calculate the area of the semicircle. The formula for the area of a full circle is:
\[
A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
\]
Since we have a semicircle, we take half of the area of the full circle:
\[
A_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2
\]
Given that the radius \( r \) is 2 meters, we substitute \( r = 2 \) into the formula:
\[
A_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 4 = 2\pi
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
\[
A_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]
Given that the width is 3 meters and the height is 2 meters, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[
A_{\text{rectangle}} = 3 \times 2 = 6
\]

Now, we add the area of the semicircle and the area of the rectangle to find the total area of the region where the athlete can run:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{semicircle}} + A_{\text{rectangle}} = 2\pi + 6

Therefore, the area of the region where the athlete can run is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by recalling the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.

Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(R\) as 2 units and the hypotenuse as 5 units. Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(x\):

\[
x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
x^2 + 4 = 25
\]
\[
x^2 = 21
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary (they add up to \(90^\circ\)), \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\). The cosine of an angle is the length of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore,

\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

"To find the value of \(a + b\) where the point of tangency of the line \(y = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} x\) to the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right)\) is given by \(\sqrt{a}/b\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the derivative of the curve:**
   The curve is given by \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right)\). To find the slope of the tangent line at any point \(x\), we take the derivative of \(y\) with respect to \(x\):
   \[
   y' = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2} x.
   \]

2. **Determine the slope of the tangent line at the point of tangency:**
   The slope of the tangent line at the point of tangency is equal to the slope of the line \(y = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} x\), which is \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} x = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}.
   \]

3. **Find the coordinates of the point of tangency:**
   The point of tangency is given by \(\left( \sqrt{a}/b, \sqrt{a}/b \cdot \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \right) = \left( \sqrt{a}/b, \frac{a}{b^2} \right)\). This point must satisfy the equation of the curve:
   \[
   \frac{a}{b^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \left( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \right)^2 - 3 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{a}{b^2} - 3 \right).
   \]

4. **Solve for \(a\) and \(b\):**
   Substitute \(\frac{a}{b^2}\) with \(x\) in the equation:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x - 3 \right).
   \]
   Multiply both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\):
   \[
   \sqrt{2} x = x - 3.
   \]
   Rearrange the equation to isolate \(x\):
   \[
   \sqrt{2} x - x = -3 \implies x (\sqrt{2} - 1) = -3 \implies x = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{2} - 1}.
   \]
   Rationalize the denominator:
   \[
   x = \frac{-3 (\sqrt{2} + 1)}{(\sqrt{2} - 1)(\sqrt{2} + 1)} = \frac{-3 (\sqrt{2} + 1)}{2 - 1} = -3 (\sqrt{2} + 1) = -3\sqrt{2} - 3.
   \]
   Since \(x = \frac{a}{b}\), we have:
   \[
   \frac{a}{b} = -3\sqrt{2} - 3.
   \]
   However, since \(a\) and \(b\) are positive, we take the positive value:
   \[
   \frac{a}{b} = 3\sqrt{2} + 3.
   \]
   Therefore, \(a = 3\sqrt{2} + 3\) and \(b = 1\). The sum \(a + b\) is:
   \[
   a + b = (3\sqrt{2} + 3) + 1 = 3\sqrt{2} + 4.

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{cases} \]

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us three solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]
Since \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 3 \) do not satisfy \( x > 3 \), the only solution is \( x = -1 \).

Therefore, the solutions to \( f(x) = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( f^{-1}(0) \) is the value of \( x \) that we are looking for, and typically we consider the smallest or the first solution in the context of inverse functions, we have:
\[ f^{-1}(0) = -1 \]

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ -x = 3 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging terms:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. We can factor \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 \) as:
\[ -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) \]
The quadratic \( x^2 + 3 \) has no real roots, so the only real solution is \( x = 2 \). Since \( x = 2 \) satisfies \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this case.

Therefore, the solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Since \( f^{-1}(6) \) is the value of \( x \) that we are looking for, and typically we consider the smallest or the first solution in the context of inverse functions, we have:
\[ f^{-1}(6) = -3 \]

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = -1 + (-3) = -4 \]

"To determine the ratio of the weight of the pêl feddal of Jack to the weight of the pêl feddal of Jen, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of the pêl feddal of Jack.
2. Identify the weight of the pêl feddal of Jen.
3. Calculate the ratio of the weight of Jack's pêl feddal to the weight of Jen's pêl feddal.

From the problem, we know:
- The weight of the pêl feddal of Jack is 200 grams.
- The weight of the pêl feddal of Jen is 150 grams.

The ratio of the weight of Jack's pêl feddal to the weight of Jen's pêl feddal is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Weight of Jack's pêl feddal}}{\text{Weight of Jen's pêl feddal}} = \frac{200}{150}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:
\[
\frac{200 \div 50}{150 \div 50} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the weight of the pêl feddal of Jack to the weight of the pêl feddal of Jen is \(\boxed{\frac{4}{3}}\).","[4/3, '\\frac{4}{3}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine if the number \(629_{10}\) can be expressed as a sum of powers of 7 and 8, we need to find non-negative integers \(a\) and \(b\) such that:

\[629 = 7^a + 8^b\]

First, let's list the powers of 7 and 8 that are less than or equal to 629:

\[7^0 = 1, \quad 7^1 = 7, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 7^3 = 343, \quad 7^4 = 2401 \quad (\text{too large})\]
\[8^0 = 1, \quad 8^1 = 8, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 8^3 = 512, \quad 8^4 = 4096 \quad (\text{too large})\]

Now, we will try different combinations of these powers to see if they sum to 629.

1. Start with the largest power of 7, which is \(343\):
   \[629 - 343 = 286\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 286\). The largest such power is \(8^3 = 512\), but \(512 > 286\). So, we try the next largest power of 8, which is \(8^2 = 64\):
   \[286 - 64 = 222\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 222\). The largest such power is \(8^2 = 64\):
   \[222 - 64 = 158\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 158\). The largest such power is \(8^2 = 64\):
   \[158 - 64 = 94\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 94\). The largest such power is \(8^2 = 64\):
   \[94 - 64 = 30\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 30\). The largest such power is \(8^1 = 8\):
   \[30 - 8 = 22\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 22\). The largest such power is \(8^1 = 8\):
   \[22 - 8 = 14\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 14\). The largest such power is \(8^1 = 8\):
   \[14 - 8 = 6\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 6\). The largest such power is \(8^0 = 1\):
   \[6 - 1 = 5\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 5\). The largest such power is \(8^0 = 1\):
   \[5 - 1 = 4\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 4\). The largest such power is \(8^0 = 1\):
   \[4 - 1 = 3\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 3\). The largest such power is \(8^0 = 1\):
   \[3 - 1 = 2\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 2\). The largest such power is \(8^0 = 1\):
   \[2 - 1 = 1\]
   Now, we need to find \(8^b\) such that \(8^b \leq 1\). The largest such power is \(8^0 = 1\):
   \[1 - 1 = 0\]

So, we have found that:

\[629 = 343 + 64 + 64 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the polynomial \( f(x) \) and the polynomial \( f(x-1) \). The polynomial \( g(x) \) is defined as \( g(x) = f(x-1) \).

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \). Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:

\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

"To determine if Beth's statement is correct, we need to check if the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) can be simplified to a fraction where the numerator and the denominator are both odd numbers. Let's start by simplifying the fraction.

First, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 137 and 500. Since 137 is a prime number, we only need to check if it divides 500. We do this by performing the division:

\[ 500 \div 137 \approx 3.650 \]

Since 3.650 is not an integer, 137 does not divide 500. Therefore, the GCD of 137 and 500 is 1, which means the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) is already in its simplest form.

Now, we need to check if both the numerator and the denominator are odd numbers. The numerator is 137, which is an odd number, and the denominator is 500, which is an even number. Since the denominator is even, the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) cannot be simplified to a fraction where both the numerator and the denominator are odd numbers.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the ratio of the areas of triangles \(OBC\) and \(OCD\) given that \(AB/AD = k\). Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

1. **Identify the Geometry and Symmetry:**
   - \(ABCD\) is a quadrilateral with \(O\) as the intersection of its diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).
   - \(AB/AD = k\), which means the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) are in the ratio \(k\).

2. **Area of Triangles:**
   - The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula \(\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
   - For triangles \(OBC\) and \(OCD\), the height from \(O\) to \(BC\) and \(CD\) is the same (the perpendicular distance from \(O\) to the line \(BC\) and \(CD\)).

3. **Base Proportions:**
   - The base of triangle \(OBC\) is \(BC\).
   - The base of triangle \(OCD\) is \(CD\).
   - Since \(AB/AD = k\), and assuming \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram (which is a common assumption in such problems without additional information), the sides \(BC\) and \(CD\) are equal to \(AD\) and \(AB\) respectively. Therefore, \(BC/CD = AD/AB = 1/k\).

4. **Area Ratio:**
   - The ratio of the areas of triangles \(OBC\) and \(OCD\) is equal to the ratio of their bases \(BC\) and \(CD\) because they share the same height.

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at three different values: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\ 
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4. 
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate each term step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( 1.05 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f\left(\sqrt{45}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f\left(\sqrt{45}\right) = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f\left(8^{2/3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f\left(8^{2/3}\right) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f\left(\sqrt{45}\right) + f\left(8^{2/3}\right) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

- Sherry spent \$35.23.
- June spent \$37.37.
- Connie spent \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[

So, the total amount spent is \$126.59.

Next, let's calculate the total amount received from the sales:
- Linda received \$27.47.
- Sherry received \$35.23.
- June received \$37.37.
- Connie received \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together, we get:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Notice that this is the same addition as we did for the total amount spent. Therefore, the total amount received is also \$126.59.

Since the total amount spent is equal to the total amount received, the difference between the two totals is:
\[
126.59 - 126.59 = 0

\]

We need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies the conditions given in the problem. Let's start by examining the relationships between the numbers in the grid.

First, let's look at the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal. The sum of the numbers in the first row is:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

The sum of the numbers in the second row is:

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1

The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1

The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6

The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1

The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal is:
\[

\]

The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

From the above sums, we can see that the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and the other diagonal are equal to \( 2n + 1 \) or \( 3n - 6 \). However, the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal is \( 4n - 13 \), which must also be equal to one of these sums. Since \( 4n - 13 \) is not equal to \( 2n + 1 \) or \( 3n - 6 \) for any integer \( n \), it must be equal to the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal, which is \( 3n - 6 \).

Therefore, we have:
\[
4n - 13 = 3n - 6

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[

So the expression becomes:

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

Heron's formula states that the area of a triangle with sides of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}
\]
where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:
\[
s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
\]

For triangle \(ABC\), we have \(a = 5\), \(b = 6\), and \(c = 6\). Therefore, the semi-perimeter \(s\) is:
\[
s = \frac{5 + 6 + 6}{2} = \frac{17}{2}
\]

Now, we can substitute \(s\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into Heron's formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{17}{2}\right)\left(\frac{17}{2} - 5\right)\left(\frac{17}{2} - 6\right)\left(\frac{17}{2} - 6\right)} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{17}{2}\right)\left(\frac{7}{2}\right)\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)\left(\frac{5}{2}\right)}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root, we get:
\[
\text{Area} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{17 \cdot 7 \cdot 5 \cdot 5}{16}\right)} = \sqrt{\frac{2975}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{2975}}{4} = \frac{5\sqrt{119}}{4}
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{5\sqrt{119}}{4}}
\]","[(5*sqrt(119))/4, '\\frac{5\\sqrt{119}}{4}']",13,"[13, '13']",False
