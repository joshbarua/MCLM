"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the length \(EF\) is simply the difference in the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), which is \(7 - 0 = 7\) units. This confirms that the y-coordinate of \(E\) is indeed 7.

Next, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the plane is given by the distance formula:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\) into the formula, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}

"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \) (since clockwise rotation is negative counterclockwise):**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) around the origin is given by multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = -2 + 2 - 4i - 3i = -7i

"To determine the number of ways 8 osób can usiąść przy okrągłym stole, given that 3 specific osób (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can treat these 3 individuals as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) in a line.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: This means we now have 6 units to arrange (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals).

2. **Arrange the 6 units**: The number of ways to arrange 6 units in a line is given by the factorial of 6, which is \(6!\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
   \]

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 individuals is given by the factorial of 3, which is \(3!\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of ways to arrange the 8 individuals with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, we have:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]
So:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To determine the minimal number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to match its original position, we need to understand the properties of a regular pentagon and its rotational symmetry.

A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\). Therefore, each interior angle of a regular pentagon is \(\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ\).

A regular pentagon can be rotated around its center by certain angles and still look the same. These angles are the multiples of \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\). This is because a full rotation of \(360^\circ\) divided by the number of sides (5) gives the smallest angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself.

The possible angles of rotation are \(0^\circ, 72^\circ, 144^\circ, 216^\circ,\) and \(288^\circ\). The minimal non-zero angle of rotation is \(72^\circ\).

Therefore, the minimal number of degrees the regular pentagon must be rotated to match its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct coordinates should be \((x, y)\) such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. The correct calculation should be re-evaluated with the correct constraints. The correct answer should be:
\[

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the polynomial in the denominator. The numerator is \( 2x \), which is a polynomial of degree 1, and the denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \), which is a polynomial of degree 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\).

The largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \) is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).

3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:

2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[

\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising. Let's denote the radius of the tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the water by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of water in the tank is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). To find the radius \( r \), we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0,0)\). For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\), which is a parabola starting at \((a, a^3)\) and opening upwards.

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\), which is a straight line starting at \((a, 3a)\) and extending to the left.

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must not be entirely above the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). Specifically, the minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) should be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\).

The minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a^3\). The maximum value of \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is \(f(a) = 3a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq 3a. \]
Assuming \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[ a^2 \leq 3. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} \leq a \leq \sqrt{3}. \]
Since \(a\) is a positive number, we have:
\[ 0 < a \leq \sqrt{3}. \]
The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this inequality is \(a = \sqrt{3}\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find \(f(f(x))\). We start by letting \(y = f(x)\), so:

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

Now, we need to find \(f(y)\):

\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We want \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we set up the equation:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(a\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(a) \neq a\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points.

A fixed point of \(f\) is a solution to the equation \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

So, the fixed points are:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) must be a point that is not a fixed point. We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) that is not a fixed point but satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's consider the case when \(\lambda = 4\):

\[ f(x) = 4x(1 - x). \]

The fixed points are:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4 - 1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}. \]

We need to check if there is any \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{3}{4}\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's find \(f(f(x))\):

\[ f(x) = 4x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(4x(1 - x)) = 4(4x(1 - x))(1 - 4x(1 - x)) = 16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2). \]

We need to solve:

\[ 16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ 16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - x = 0, \]
\[ x(16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1) = 0. \]

So, \(x = 0\) is a solution, but we are looking for \(x \neq 0\). We need to solve:

\[ 16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) - 1 = 0. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ 16(1 - 4x + 4x^2 - x + 4x^2 - 4x^3) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ 16(1 - 5x + 8x^2 - 4x^3) - 1 = 0, \]
\[ 16 - 80x + 128x^2 - 64x^3 - 1 = 0, \]
\[ 15 - 80x + 128x^2 - 64x^3 = 0. \]

This is a cubic equation. We already know that \(x = \frac{3}{4}\) is a root. We can factor out \(x - \frac{3}{4}\):

\[ 15 - 80x + 128x^2 - 64x^3 = (x - \frac{3}{4})(-64x^2 + 32x - 5). \]

The quadratic equation \(-64x^2 + 32x - 5 = 0\) has no real roots because the discriminant is:

\[ 32^2 - 4(-64)(-5) = 1024 - 1280 = -256. \]

Therefore, the only real root of the cubic equation is \(x = \frac{3}{4}\), which is a fixed point. This means that for \(\lambda = 4\), there is no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(0 \le \lambda < 4\), the function \(f(x)\) will have fixed points, and there will be values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are:

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The expression is:

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.

The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and is the smallest positive angle is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters L, I, P, S are all 1.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 0 \) to maximize \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is maximized when \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

Notice that \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \frac{1}{\alpha} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} = \alpha - 1 \). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as \( z = \alpha \) or \( z = \frac{1}{\alpha} = \alpha - 1 \).

We will consider \( z = \alpha \). The case \( z = \alpha - 1 \) will yield the same result due to symmetry. We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = \alpha \), we have:
\[
z^{85} = \alpha^{85} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{\alpha^{85}}.
\]
We know that \( \alpha^2 = \alpha + 1 \), so we can use this to find a pattern in the powers of \( \alpha \). Let's compute the first few powers of \( \alpha \):
\[
\alpha^3 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^2 = \alpha(\alpha + 1) = \alpha^2 + \alpha = (\alpha + 1) + \alpha = 2\alpha + 1,
\]
\[
\alpha^4 = \alpha \cdot \alpha^3 = \alpha(2\alpha + 1) = 2\alpha^2 + \alpha = 2(\alpha + 1) + \alpha = 3\alpha + 2.
\]
We observe that the powers of \( \alpha \) can be written in the form \( F_n \alpha + F_{n-1} \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, we have:
\[
\alpha^{85} = F_{85} \alpha + F_{84}.
\]
Similarly,
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha^{85}} = \frac{1}{F_{85} \alpha + F_{84}}.
\]
However, we can use the fact that \( \alpha + \frac{1}{\alpha} = \alpha + \alpha - 1 = 2\alpha - 1 \) and the periodicity of the Fibonacci sequence modulo 5 to find that \( \alpha^{85} + \frac{1}{\alpha^{85}} \) is simply the 85th Fibonacci number. The 85th Fibonacci number is 9227465, so:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 9227465.

Thus, the answer is:

"To find the area of triangle \(EFG\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), it divides triangle \(ABC\) into two regions of equal area. This is because the centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area, and the line \(MN\) passes through the centroid, effectively dividing the triangle into a smaller triangle \(AMN\) and a quadrilateral \(BMNC\), both of which have equal areas.

The area of triangle \(AMN\) is one-third of the area of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48.
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(BMNC\) is the remaining two-thirds of the area of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \text{Quadrilateral } BMNC = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{2}{3} \times 144 = 96.
\]

Since line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), the smaller triangle \(EFG\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(1:3\) (because \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, and the line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid, effectively scaling the smaller triangle \(EFG\) by a factor of \(1/3\) compared to triangle \(ABC\)).

The area of a similar triangle is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio. Therefore, the area of triangle \(EFG\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle EFG = \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16.

- \(a_1\) is the first term,

We are given the 4th term \(a_4 = 200\) and the 7th term \(a_7 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the 4th term from the equation for the 7th term:

\[ (a_1 + 6d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 3d = 300 \]
\[ d = 100 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the 4th term to find the first term \(a_1\):

"To determine how many additional two-digit integers are divisible by both 100 and 150, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(100, 150) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 3 \times 25 = 300

So, the numbers that are divisible by both 100 and 150 are the multiples of 300. We need to find all two-digit multiples of 300. The smallest two-digit number is 10, and the largest two-digit number is 99. We check if 300 is a two-digit number:
\[

Since 300 is the only multiple of 300 that is a two-digit number, there are no two-digit integers that are divisible by both 100 and 150.

"To determine for which positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) for which \( 2^{24} = n^k \).

First, express \( n \) in terms of its prime factorization. Let \( n = 2^a \cdot m \), where \( m \) is an odd integer. Then, we have:
\[
2^{24} = (2^a \cdot m)^k = 2^{ak} \cdot m^k.
\]
For \( 2^{24} \) to be a perfect \( n \)-th power, both \( 2^{ak} \) and \( m^k \) must be perfect \( n \)-th powers. Since \( m \) is odd, \( m^k \) is odd and cannot contribute to the power of 2 in the factorization. Therefore, \( m^k \) must be 1, which implies \( m = 1 \). Thus, \( n = 2^a \).

Now, we need \( 2^{24} = 2^{ak} \), which simplifies to:
\[
24 = ak.
\]
The possible values for \( a \) are the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. For each value of \( a \), we can find the corresponding value of \( k \):
- If \( a = 1 \), then \( k = 24 \).
- If \( a = 2 \), then \( k = 12 \).
- If \( a = 3 \), then \( k = 8 \).
- If \( a = 4 \), then \( k = 6 \).
- If \( a = 6 \), then \( k = 4 \).
- If \( a = 8 \), then \( k = 3 \).
- If \( a = 12 \), then \( k = 2 \).
- If \( a = 24 \), then \( k = 1 \).

Therefore, the possible values for \( n \) are \( 2^1 = 2 \), \( 2^2 = 4 \), \( 2^3 = 8 \), \( 2^4 = 16 \), \( 2^6 = 64 \), \( 2^8 = 256 \), \( 2^{12} = 4096 \), and \( 2^{24} = 16777216 \).

"To determine how many pięciocentówek Hillary ma, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of coins and their values.
2. Calculate the total value of the coins in cents.
3. Determine how many pięciocentówek are included in the total value.

First, let's denote the number of dziesięciocentówek as \( d \) and the number of pięciocentówek as \( p \). According to the problem, Hillary has a total of 11 coins, so we can write the equation:
\[ d + p = 11 \]

Next, we know that each dziesięciocentówek is worth 100 cents and each pięciocentówek is worth 100 cents. The total value of the coins is given as 75 cents. Therefore, we can write another equation for the total value:
\[ 100d + 100p = 75 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 100:
\[ d + p = 0.75 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( d + p = 11 \)
2. \( d + p = 0.75 \)

However, there seems to be a mistake in the problem statement because the total value of 75 cents cannot be achieved with 11 coins, each worth 100 cents or 100 cents. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the total value of the coins is 75 cents, which is not possible with the given conditions.

If the problem meant to say that the total value of the coins is 750 cents (since 75 cents is not possible with 11 coins), then we can proceed as follows:

\[ 100d + 100p = 750 \]

Simplifying this equation by dividing every term by 100:
\[ d + p = 7.5 \]

This equation is still not possible because the number of coins must be a whole number. Therefore, the problem as stated is not solvable under the given conditions.

However, if the problem meant to say that the total value of the coins is 750 cents, then the correct interpretation would be that the problem is not solvable under the given conditions.

We need to find a number that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 0 and 1. This number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's consider each condition:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\tan (90^\circ - x) = \cot x\). Therefore, \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\) and \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ\). We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ = \cot 70^\circ\) and \(\tan 40^\circ = \cot 50^\circ\). Using the identity \(\tan x \cot x = 1\), we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We need to find a way to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\). Using the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), we get:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

This is the same as the original expression, but in a different form. To find the value, we can use known results or symmetry properties of the tangent function. It is known that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of its internal angles, excluding one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the internal angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the measure of the excluded internal angle be \(x\). Then, the sum of the remaining internal angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x\) is an internal angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 180^\circ < 1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the left inequality:
   \[
   (n-3) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-3 < \frac{1070}{180} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]
   Simplifying the right inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2 \approx 5.9444
   \]
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]
   Combining both inequalities, we get:
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

2. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the total sum of the internal angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If one internal angle is excluded, the sum of the remaining internal angles is:
   \[
   1080^\circ - x
   \]
   Since \(x < 180^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   1080^\circ - 180^\circ < 1080^\circ - x < 1080^\circ
   \]
   \[
   900^\circ < 1080^\circ - x < 1080^\circ

   Given that \(1080^\circ - x = 1070^\circ\), it is clear that:
   \[
   900^\circ < 1070^\circ < 1080^\circ

"To find a unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:

\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ (-5)^2 = 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). We will use both values to find the corresponding values of \( t \).

1. If \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \):

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Since 4 is even, it does not satisfy the condition of being odd.

\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since 17 is odd, it satisfies the condition.

2. If \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \):

\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since 17 is odd, it satisfies the condition.

\[ t \equiv -1 - 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -19 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Since 4 is even, it does not satisfy the condition of being odd.

The only odd solution is \( t = 17 \). Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is:

Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"The given sequence is a sequence of odd numbers: \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\). This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.

Setting this equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel. Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors, which will give us the direction vector of the line connecting the two lines. However, since the lines are parallel, the distance between them is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line. We can use the formula for the distance between a point and a line in 3D space.

Let's use the point \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and the point \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) on the second line. The vector connecting these two points is

\[
D = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2|}{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2|}.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2\):

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \mathbf{0}.
\]

Since \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \mathbf{0}\), the lines are not skew but actually parallel. Therefore, the distance between the two lines is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line. We can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space:

\[
D = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}_1|}{|\mathbf{d}_1|}.

First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
|\mathbf{d}_1| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Next, we need to find the dot product \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}_1 = (-8)(2) + (7)(-9) + (5)(-2) = -16 - 63 - 10 = -89.
\]

Therefore, the distance \(D\) is

\[
D = \frac{|-89|}{\sqrt{89}} = \frac{89}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{89}.

\[

"To find the average number of stamps Juan collected in the 70s, we need to calculate the total number of stamps collected in the 70s and then divide by the number of decades (which is 1 in this case since we are only considering the 70s).

From the table, we can see the number of stamps collected in the 70s for each country:

- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 4 stamps
- Spain: 6 stamps

First, we sum these values:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]
This implies:
\[
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

Next, we know that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), so \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be found using the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector and the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \sin \angle ABC
\]
However, since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector, we can use the fact that the areas of the triangles formed by the angle bisector are proportional to the adjacent sides:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{AB}{AB + BC} \cdot [\triangle ABC + \triangle ACD] = \frac{d}{d + b} \cdot 42
\]

"To determine the probability that the odcinki \(AB\) i \(CD\) się przecinają, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the points chosen on its circumference.

First, let's fix one of the points, say \(A\), and consider the positions of the other points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) relative to \(A\). The points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of the circle. We can think of the circle as a unit circle with a circumference of \(2\pi\).

The odcinki \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points \(B\) and \(D\) lie on opposite sides of the line passing through \(A\) and \(C\). This is equivalent to saying that the arc length between \(B\) and \(D\) that does not contain \(A\) and \(C\) is less than half the circumference of the circle.

To find the probability of this happening, we can use the fact that the positions of \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are uniformly distributed. We can fix the position of \(C\) and consider the positions of \(B\) and \(D\) relative to \(C\). The probability that \(B\) and \(D\) lie on opposite sides of the line passing through \(C\) is the same as the probability that the arc length between \(B\) and \(D\) that does not contain \(A\) and \(C\) is less than half the circumference of the circle.

This probability can be calculated as follows:
1. Fix the position of \(C\).
2. The position of \(B\) can be anywhere on the circle, so the probability that \(B\) lies on the same semicircle as \(C\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\).
3. Given that \(B\) lies on the same semicircle as \(C\), the position of \(D\) must lie on the opposite semicircle to \(A\) and \(C\) for the odcinki \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect. The probability that \(D\) lies on the opposite semicircle to \(A\) and \(C\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Therefore, the probability that the odcinki \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

However, we need to consider that the probability that \(B\) and \(D\) lie on opposite sides of the line passing through \(A\) and \(C\) is actually \(\frac{1}{2}\) because the odcinki \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points \(B\) and \(D\) lie on opposite sides of the line passing through \(A\) and \(C\).

Thus, the correct probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so the area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, so the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. The larger segment is part of the larger circle with radius 2, and the smaller segment is part of the smaller circle with radius 1. The area of the larger segment can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle \(ADC\) from the area of the sector \(ADC\) of the larger circle. Similarly, the area of the smaller segment can be found by subtracting the area of the triangle \(ADC\) from the area of the sector \(ADC\) of the smaller circle.

The area of the sector \(ADC\) of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi
\]
where \(\theta\) is the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees.

The area of the sector \(ADC\) of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \sin \theta
\]

The area of the larger segment is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi - \sin \theta
\]

The area of the smaller segment is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \sin \theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi - \sin \theta \right) + \left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \sin \theta \right) = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 5\pi - 2\sin \theta
\]

We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we have:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 5\pi - 2\sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we can use the fact that \(\sin \theta\) is small for small angles. However, we can also use the fact that the area of the smaller segment is much smaller than the area of the larger segment, so \(\sin \theta\) is small. Therefore, we can approximate:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 5\pi \approx \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Solving for \(\theta\), we get:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 5\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}

\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{1}{3}

"To determine how many cylindrical zleweks are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical zleweks and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the volume of one zlewek.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical zlewek. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical zlewek, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Therefore, the volume \( V_{\text{cylinder}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Therefore, the volume \( V_{\text{sphere}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

\[ \text{Number of zleweks} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - 2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B.
\]
We know that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). Therefore, \(\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = 0.9165\) and \(\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = 0.8660\). Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A = 0.4 \cdot 0.8660 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.9165 = 0.1558,
\]
\[
\cos^2 A \sin^2 B = (0.9165)^2 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 0.84 \cdot 0.25 = 0.21,
\]
\[
2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = 2 \cdot (0.4)^2 \cdot (0.8660)^2 = 2 \cdot 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.24.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
0.1558 + 0.21 - 0.24 = 0.1258.
\]
However, we can use a simpler approach by recognizing that the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\) can be simplified using the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x - y) - \cos (x + y)].
\]
Let \(x = \arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5\) and \(y = \arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4\). Then:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x - y) - \cos (x + y)] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2 \arcsin 0.5) - \cos (2 \arcsin 0.4)].
\]
We know that \(\cos (2 \arcsin 0.5) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.5) = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.5\) and \(\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.4) = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 0.68\). Therefore:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [0.5 - 0.68] = \frac{1}{2} [-0.18] = -0.09.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a commission of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 120 and whose average, when 120 is divided by this average, is 24. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120:
\[
x(x+1)(x+2) = 120
\]

Next, we know that the average of these three integers is:
\[
\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1
\]
When 120 is divided by this average, the result is 24:
\[
\frac{120}{x+1} = 24
\]
Solving for \(x+1\), we get:
\[
120 = 24(x+1) \implies x+1 = 5 \implies x = 4
\]

Now that we have \(x = 4\), the three consecutive integers are \(x = 4\), \(x+1 = 5\), and \(x+2 = 6\). Let's verify that their product is indeed 120:
\[

"To find the positive value of \( x \) for which \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \( 4096 = 64^2 \), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

In our case, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there exists a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle AMB \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB}.
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta}.
\]

Next, we use the right triangle \( \triangle AMD \):
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{DM}{AD} = \frac{DM}{10} \implies DM = 10 \sin \theta.
\]
Since \( AM = 11 \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have:
\[
MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1.
\]
Therefore,
\[
10 \sin \theta = 1 \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{10}.
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \), we find:
\[
\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{10}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{100} = \frac{99}{100} \implies \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{99}}{10} = \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{10}.
\]

Now, we can find \( AB \):
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta} = \frac{11}{\frac{3\sqrt{11}}{10}} = \frac{11 \cdot 10}{3\sqrt{11}} = \frac{110}{3\sqrt{11}} = \frac{110\sqrt{11}}{33} = \frac{10\sqrt{11}}{3}.
\]

Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[
AC = \frac{10\sqrt{11}}{3}.
\]

Next, we find \( BC \). Using the double-angle identity for cosine, we have:
\[
\cos 2\theta = 2\cos^2 \theta - 1 = 2\left(\frac{99}{100}\right) - 1 = \frac{198}{100} - 1 = \frac{98}{100} = \frac{49}{50}.
\]
Using the double-angle identity for sine, we have:
\[
\sin 2\theta = 2\sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{10} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{10} = \frac{6\sqrt{11}}{100} = \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{50}.
\]

In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = \sin (2\theta + \theta) = \sin 2\theta \cos \theta + \cos 2\theta \sin \theta = \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{50} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{10} + \frac{49}{50} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{9 \cdot 11}{500} + \frac{49}{500} = \frac{99 + 49}{500} = \frac{148}{500} = \frac{37}{125}.
\]
\[
\cos 3\theta = \cos (2\theta + \theta) = \cos 2\theta \cos \theta - \sin 2\theta \sin \theta = \frac{49}{50} \cdot \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{10} - \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{50} \cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{147\sqrt{11}}{500} - \frac{3\sqrt{11}}{500} = \frac{144\sqrt{11}}{500} = \frac{36\sqrt{11}}{125}.
\]

In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\sin \angle BDC = \sin 3\theta = \frac{37}{125}.
\]
\[
\sin \angle DBC = \sin \angle DCB = \frac{\sin \angle BDC}{2} = \frac{37}{125}.
\]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle DBC} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle DCB} = \frac{BD}{\frac{37}{125}} = \frac{CD}{\frac{37}{125}} = \frac{125}{37} \cdot BD = \frac{125}{37} \cdot CD.
\]
Since \( BD + CD = BC \), we have:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[

Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

\[

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):

Let's start with the calculations for each class:

1. **9th Grade:**
   - Number of males using technology: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of females using technology: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio of males to females: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.0405\)

2. **10th Grade:**
   - Number of males using technology: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Number of females using technology: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio of males to females: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.0394\)

3. **11th Grade:**
   - Number of males using technology: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of females using technology: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio of males to females: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5000\)

4. **12th Grade:**
   - Number of males using technology: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of females using technology: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio of males to females: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.3514\)

Now, we compare the ratios to \(1.35\):
- The ratio for the 9th grade is \(1.0405\), which is \(1.31\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the 10th grade is \(1.0394\), which is \(0.31\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the 11th grade is \(1.5000\), which is \(0.15\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the 12th grade is \(1.3514\), which is \(0.0014\) away from \(1.35\).

The class with the ratio closest to \(1.35\) is the 12th grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), and the expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. From the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\), we get the critical points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). From the denominator \(x(x-36)\), we get the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-\infty, -9)\).

2. For the interval \((-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-9, 0)\).

3. For the interval \((0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} = -\frac{16}{7} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((0, 9)\).

4. For the interval \((9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} = -\frac{19}{260} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((9, 36)\).

5. For the interval \((36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves. The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and it is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), the points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the inequality holds:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]

In box notation, the solution is:
\[

"To find the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangle. Let the length of the rectangle be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
2l + 2w
\]

According to the problem, the perimeter of the rectangle is 400 meters, so we have:

\[
2l + 2w = 400
\]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:

\[
l + w = 200
\]

Next, we express \( l \) in terms of \( w \):

\[
l = 200 - w
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
A = l \times w
\]

Substituting the expression for \( l \) into the area formula, we get:

\[
A = (200 - w) \times w
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
A = 200w - w^2
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to determine the vertex of the parabola represented by the quadratic equation \( A = -w^2 + 200w \). The vertex form of a parabola \( ax^2 + bx + c \) has its maximum (or minimum) at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 200 \), so:

\[
w = -\frac{200}{2(-1)} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]

Substituting \( w = 100 \) back into the equation for \( l \), we get:

\[
l = 200 - 100 = 100
\]

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle that give the maximum area are \( l = 100 \) meters and \( w = 100 \) meters. The maximum area \( A \) is:

\[
A = 100 \times 100 = 10000

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that \(RT = 5\), we can find \(RS\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
RS = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(RS = 2\), we get:

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer larger than 1, we find \(a + b\):

\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other. The distances from \( P \) to the vertices on one pair are equal to the distances from \( P \) to the vertices on the other pair, but in reverse order.

Given the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the octahedron as \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, \) and \( d_6 \), where \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5 \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 in some order, and \( d_6 \) is the distance to the sixth vertex.

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices on one pair of opposite vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from that point to the vertices on the other pair of opposite vertices. Therefore, we have:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 = d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2 + d_9^2 + d_{10}^2
\]
where \( d_7, d_8, d_9, d_{10} \) are the distances to the other two pairs of opposite vertices. Since the distances are the same but in reverse order, we can simplify this to:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 = d_6^2 + d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2
\]
This implies that:
\[
d_6^2 = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2
\]
Substituting the given distances, we get:
\[
d_6^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324

"To determine the ratio of the accelerations of the piñata ( softball) to the piñata (baseball) when both are subjected to the same force, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = ma \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both piñatas, we can write:

\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} a_{\text{softball}} \]
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} a_{\text{baseball}} \]

By equating the two expressions for the force, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We can solve for the ratio of the accelerations \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( m_{\text{baseball}} a_{\text{softball}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} \]

Given that the mass of the piñata (softball) is \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) g and the mass of the piñata (baseball) is \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) g, we substitute these values into the equation:

"To determine how many common digits are present in the representations of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

"To determine the cost of one ołówka, we start by defining the variables for the cost of one ołówka and the cost of the large gumka. Let \( x \) be the cost of one ołówka and \( y \) be the cost of the large gumka. We can then set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. \( 3x + y = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5x + y = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 0.58
\]

Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
x = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

Since the cost of one ołówka is \( x \) and there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert \( x \) to cents:

\[
x = 0.29 \times 100 = 29
\]

Therefore, the cost of one ołówka is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True
"To determine the last non-zero digit of the last non-zero digit of the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\). Since 137 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 500 other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we perform the division of 137 by 500:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = 0.274
\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The last non-zero digit of this decimal is 4.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), and vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) at \((-a, a)\), \((a, a)\), \((a, -a)\), and \((-a, -a)\) respectively, where \(a = \frac{AB}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{AD}{2}\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(b = \frac{a}{k}\).

The condition that a point \((x, y)\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed as the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) being less than the distance to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}\). Therefore, the condition that \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + 2a^2 - 2ay
\]
\[
ax + a^2 > ay
\]
\[
x + a > y
\]
\[
y < x + a
\]
Similarly, we can derive the conditions for the other vertices:
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } A\text{)}
\]
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } B\text{)}
\]
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } C\text{)}
\]
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } D\text{)}
\]
These conditions define a region below the line \(y = x + a\). This line passes through the vertices \(A\) and \(C\) and the center \(O\).

The region below the line \(y = x + a\) is a right triangle with vertices at \(O(0,0)\), \(A(-a, a)\), and \(C(a, a)\). The area of this triangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2a \times a = a^2
\]
The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = AB \times AD = 2a \times 2a = 4a^2
\]
The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{a^2}{4a^2} = \frac{1}{4}

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is \( \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is \( \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie had in total in cents and how much they could convert into banknotes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert each person's earnings from dollars to cents.
2. Sum the total amount of money in cents.
3. Determine how much of the total amount can be converted into banknotes.

First, let's convert each person's earnings from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply each person's earnings by 100.

- Linda: \(27.47 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 2747 \text{ cents}\)
- Sherry: \(35.23 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 3523 \text{ cents}\)
- June: \(37.37 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 3737 \text{ cents}\)
- Connie: \(26.52 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 2652 \text{ cents}\)

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total amount of money in cents.

\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine how much of this total amount can be converted into banknotes. Banknotes are typically in denominations of 100 cents, 500 cents, 1000 cents, etc. To maximize the number of banknotes, we should start with the largest denominations.

- The largest banknote is 1000 cents. We can fit 12 banknotes of 1000 cents into 12659 cents.
- The remaining amount after buying 12 banknotes of 1000 cents is \(12659 - 12 \times 1000 = 659\) cents.

Therefore, the total amount of money that can be converted into banknotes is 12 banknotes of 1000 cents each, which is equivalent to 12659 cents.

"To find the average (średniaarytmetyczna) score of the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide that sum by the number of students in the class.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores:

- 8 students scored 90. So, the total score for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- 2 students scored 100. So, the total score for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these total scores to get the overall total score for the class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students in the class, which is 30:

"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given square is a magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \). Let's check the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the square to be magic, the sum of the second row must also be \( 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) works for the third row:

\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

And the sum of the numbers in the first column:

\[

And the sum of the numbers in the third column:

\[

\]

And the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal:

\[

\]

And the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal:

\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + (n+2) = 8 + 14 + 6 = 24

"To determine how many stóp less Jim traveled than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim traveled. Jim idzie po przekątnej przez pole. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500
\]
So, Jim traveled 500 stóp.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha traveled. Martha dociera do tego samego miejsca, idąc wzdłużitski disciplined i szerokości. The distance Martha traveled is simply the sum of the length and the width of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Distance Martha traveled} = 300 + 400 = 700
\]
So, Martha traveled 700 stóp.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha traveled and the distance Jim traveled:
\[
700 - 500 = 200
\]
Therefore, Jim traveled \(\boxed{200}\) stóp less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we start by using the fact that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. This means that \(\omega\) satisfies the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

First, we rewrite the given expression with a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the perimeter of the triangles \( ABD \), \( ACD \), and \( BCD \) and then find the minimum perimeter among these three triangles.

First, let's list the side lengths of each triangle:
- For triangle \( ABD \):
  - \( AB = 5 \)
  - \( BD = 4 \)
  - \( AD = 5 \)
  The perimeter of triangle \( ABD \) is \( AB + BD + AD = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \).

- For triangle \( ACD \):
  - \( AC = 6 \)
  - \( CD = 6 \)
  - \( AD = 5 \)
  The perimeter of triangle \( ACD \) is \( AC + CD + AD = 6 + 6 + 5 = 17 \).

- For triangle \( BCD \):
  - \( BC = 5 \)
  - \( CD = 6 \)
  - \( BD = 4 \)
  The perimeter of triangle \( BCD \) is \( BC + CD + BD = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15 \).

Now, we compare the perimeters of the three triangles:
- Perimeter of triangle \( ABD \): 14
- Perimeter of triangle \( ACD \): 17
- Perimeter of triangle \( BCD \): 15

The shortest perimeter is 14, which corresponds to triangle \( ABD \).

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visiting the other three points exactly once is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",13,"[13, '13']",False
