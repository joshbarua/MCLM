"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(EF\) intersects \(EF\), and \(F\) is the point on the x-axis directly below \(D\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we know that \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in the right triangle \(DEF\). In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
We are given that \(EF = 7\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle \(DEF\), this gives:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can use the formula for rotating a complex number \( z \) around another complex number \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), \( c = 2 - 3i \), and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). First, we need to compute \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \]

Next, we need to find \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We use the distributive property to expand this product:

\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})(-1)\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (3 - 3\sqrt{2})\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + \left( 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2}i \right) \]
\[ = 2 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 4 + \left( -3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = 6 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{-6 + 3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = 6 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 10}{2} \right)i \]

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as one ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways, which is \(3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units around the table by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3.
\]
So,
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of grades that the Dutch national flag must have in order to be able to display the flag at its original position after a rotation, we need to consider the properties of the flag and the rotation.

The Dutch national flag consists of three horizontal stripes of different colors: blue, white, and red, arranged in that order from top to bottom. The flag is symmetric and can be rotated 180 degrees around its center. For the flag to appear the same after a 180-degree rotation, the arrangement of the stripes must be identical when viewed from the opposite side.

Let's analyze the flag's stripes:
- The top stripe is blue.
- The middle stripe is white.
- The bottom stripe is red.

When the flag is rotated 180 degrees, the top stripe will be in the bottom position, the middle stripe will be in the middle position, and the bottom stripe will be in the top position. For the flag to look the same after this rotation, the top and bottom stripes must be the same color, and the middle stripe must be the same color as itself.

From the original arrangement:
- The top stripe is blue.
- The bottom stripe is red.

For the flag to look the same after a 180-degree rotation, the top and bottom stripes must be the same color. Therefore, both the top and bottom stripes must be blue.

Since the middle stripe is white and does not need to match any other stripe, the minimum number of grades (or stripes) that the flag must have is 2 (blue on top and bottom, white in the middle).

Thus, the minimum number of grades that the Dutch national flag must have is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \((6, \frac{7}{2})\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and then sum them up, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{At } x = 7, \text{ the numerator is } 2(7) = 14 \neq 0. \]
\[ \text{At } x = -2, \text{ the numerator is } 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)
Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

We can factor out \(99\) from the first two terms:
\[

\]

Next, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
99 + 1 = 100
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
99 \times 100 + 1
\]

Now, we calculate \(99 \times 100\):
\[
99 \times 100 = 9900
\]

Finally, we add \(1\) to \(9900\):
\[
9900 + 1 = 9901

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 1 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 16 \). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

In this problem, the exponent \(2^{235423523}\) is a very large number, but it does not change the fundamental property of exponentiation with 1. Therefore, we can conclude that:

"To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions: \(z\) is a complex number such that \(z^5 = 1\) and \(z \neq 1\). This means that \(z\) is a fifth root of unity, excluding 1. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to compute the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). Since \(z^5 = 1\), it follows that \(\frac{1}{z} = z^4\) and \(\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\), we can subtract 1 from both sides to obtain:

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalent of \(18_9\) from the base \(10\) equivalent of \(58_9\):
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can cancel one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks are equivalent in weight to one squig. Let's define the weights of the treeks and the goolee in terms of a unit weight. Let's denote the weight of one squig as \( S \), the weight of one treek as \( T \), and the weight of one goolee as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Tien treeks en een goolee zijn gelyk in gewig aan drie squigs en een goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10T + G = 3S + G
   \]
   By subtracting \( G \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   10T = 3S
   \]
   Therefore, the weight of one treek is:
   \[
   T = \frac{3S}{10}
   \]

2. Twee treeks en een goolee zijn gelyk in gewig aan een squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]
   We already know that \( T = \frac{3S}{10} \), so we substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   2 \left( \frac{3S}{10} \right) + G = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{6S}{10} + G = S
   \]
   which simplifies further to:
   \[
   \frac{3S}{5} + G = S
   \]
   To isolate \( G \), we subtract \( \frac{3S}{5} \) from both sides:
   \[
   G = S - \frac{3S}{5}
   \]
   To combine the terms on the right side, we convert \( S \) to a fraction with a denominator of 5:
   \[
   G = \frac{5S}{5} - \frac{3S}{5} = \frac{2S}{5}
   \]
   So, the weight of one goolee is \( \frac{2S}{5} \).

Now, we need to find out how many treeks are equivalent in weight to one squig. Let \( x \) be the number of treeks equivalent in weight to one squig. Then:
\[
xT = S
\]
Substituting \( T = \frac{3S}{10} \) into the equation, we get:
\[
x \left( \frac{3S}{10} \right) = S

To isolate \( x \), we divide both sides by \( \frac{3S}{10} \):
\[
x = S \div \frac{3S}{10} = S \times \frac{10}{3S} = \frac{10}{3}
\]
Therefore, the number of treeks equivalent in weight to one squig is \( \frac{10}{3} \). In box format, the answer is:

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
3b = 6
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
b = 2

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
Simplify:
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4a = -12
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
a = -3
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16

Simplify:
\[
-10 - 6 = -16

\[
-16 = -16

This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

By comparing the constant terms, we get:

-2a = 6

Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[
-2(-3) = 6

Simplify:
\[
6 = 6
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the given information about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank. We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \).

To find the radius \( r \), we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) piecewise and ensure that it covers all possible \(y\)-values.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
  \[ f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]
  As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
  \[ f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]
  As \(x\) decreases, \(f(x)\) decreases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the line increases as \(x\) increases. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the line decreases as \(x\) increases. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

### Step 3: Combine the ranges for both pieces
- If \(a > 0\), the total range of \(f(x)\) is the union of \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\), which is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a] \cup [a^3, \infty)\). For the graph to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of the range must be less than or equal to the maximum value:
  \[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
  Solving this inequality:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \leq -1\) or \(0 < a \leq 2\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(0 < a \leq 2\).

- If \(a < 0\), the total range of \(f(x)\) is the union of \((-\infty, a^3]\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\), which is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a]\). For the graph to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the maximum value of the range must be greater than or equal to the minimum value:
  \[ a^2 + 2a \geq a^3. \]
  Solving this inequality:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \leq -1\) or \(0 < a \leq 2\). Since \(a < 0\), we have \(a \leq -1\).

### Step 4: Determine the largest value of \(a\)
The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \(x\), so we have:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(a\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there is a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) other than \(a = 0\) or \(a = 1\), we need to analyze the equation. First, let's consider the case when \(a = 0\) or \(a = 1\):

- If \(a = 0\), then \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0\), so \(a = 0\) is a solution.
- If \(a = 1\), then \(f(1) = 0\) and \(f(f(1)) = f(0) = 0 \neq 1\), so \(a = 1\) is not a solution.

Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there is a solution \(a \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(a) \neq a\) and \(f(f(a)) = a\).

Let's rewrite the equation:

\[ \lambda^2 a(1 - a)(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

If \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - a)(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - a - \lambda a + \lambda a^2) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 a - \lambda^3 a + \lambda^3 a^2 = 1. \]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation in \(a\):

\[ \lambda^3 a^2 - (\lambda^2 + \lambda^3) a + (\lambda^2 - 1) = 0. \]

For this quadratic equation to have a solution \(a \in (0,1)\), the discriminant must be non-negative, and the solutions must lie in the interval \((0,1)\). The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by:

\[ \Delta = (\lambda^2 + \lambda^3)^2 - 4 \lambda^3 (\lambda^2 - 1) = \lambda^4 + 2\lambda^5 + \lambda^6 - 4\lambda^5 + 4\lambda^3 = \lambda^6 - 2\lambda^5 + \lambda^4 + 4\lambda^3 = \lambda^3 (\lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + \lambda + 4). \]

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(\Delta \geq 0\) and the solutions to the quadratic equation lie in \((0,1)\). By analyzing the polynomial \(\lambda^3 - 2\lambda^2 + \lambda + 4\), we find that it has a root at \(\lambda = 2\). Therefore, the discriminant is non-negative for \(\lambda \in [0,2]\).

For \(\lambda = 2\), the quadratic equation becomes:

\[ 8a^2 - 12a + 3 = 0. \]

The solutions are:

\[ a = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 - 96}}{16} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{48}}{16} = \frac{12 \pm 4\sqrt{3}}{16} = \frac{3 \pm \sqrt{3}}{4}. \]

Both solutions are in the interval \((0,1)\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) is a valid solution.

For \(\lambda \in (2,4]\), the quadratic equation has no real solutions in the interval \((0,1)\).

Thus, the only value of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is \(\lambda = 2\).

\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this further, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is \(\theta = 120^\circ\) (since \(\tan 120^\circ = \tan (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = -\tan 60^\circ = -\sqrt{3}\)).

Therefore, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is \(\boxed{120^\circ}\).","[120, '120^\\circ']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",True
"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first need to identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Here, the letter E appears twice, and the letter L appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{5040}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{5040}{4} = 1260

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{1260}\).","[1260, '1260']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",True
"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher powers of 5 will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 0 \) to maximize \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is maximized when \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Similarly, if \( x = -1 \), then \( y = 0 \) to maximize \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is maximized when \( y = 0 \). Thus, \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \).

If \( y = 1 \), then \( x = 0 \) to maximize \( f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), which is maximized when \( x = 0 \). Thus, \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

If \( y = -1 \), then \( x = 0 \) to maximize \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \), which is maximized when \( x = 0 \). Thus, \( f(0, -1) = -1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get \( 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \), so \( x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we get:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 1.
\]
Thus, \( f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1 \) and \( f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1 \).

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The cross product is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
So, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is positive, we have:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Using the identity for the cosine of a multiple angle, we know that \( \cos 85\theta \) can be expressed in terms of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \cos 85\theta \) is periodic with period 10, because \( \cos 10\theta = \cos \theta \) for the golden ratio. Therefore, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos 5\theta \).

We can find \( \cos 5\theta \) using the multiple angle formula for cosine:

\[ \cos 5\theta = 16 \cos^5 \theta - 20 \cos^3 \theta + 5 \cos \theta. \]

Substituting \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we get:

\[ \cos^2 \theta = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8}, \]

\[ \cos^3 \theta = \cos \theta \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(3 + \sqrt{5})}{32} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} + 3\sqrt{5} + 5}{32} = \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{5}}{32} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8}, \]

\[ \cos^5 \theta = \cos \theta \cos^4 \theta = \cos \theta (1 - 2\cos^2 \theta + \cos^4 \theta) = \cos \theta (1 - 2 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} + \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8}) = \cos \theta (1 - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8}) = \cos \theta \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(5 - \sqrt{5})}{32} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{5} + 5\sqrt{5} - 5}{32} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{32} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{8}. \]

Substituting these values into the expression for \( \cos 5\theta \), we get:

\[ \cos 5\theta = 16 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{8} - 20 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} + 5 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{20 + 20\sqrt{5}}{8} + \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{10 + 10\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{8\sqrt{5} - 5 - 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{5} - 5}{4}. \]

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.
- Let \( q \) be the number of quarters.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 10.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( d + n + q = 10 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n + 25q = 75 \) (since dimes are worth 10 cents, nickels are worth 5 cents, and quarters are worth 25 cents)

We need to solve this system of equations step by step. First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can start by expressing \( q \) in terms of \( d \) and \( n \) from the first equation:
\[ q = 10 - d - n \]

Next, substitute this expression for \( q \) into the second equation:
\[ 10d + 5n + 25(10 - d - n) = 75 \]

Now, distribute the 25:
\[ 10d + 5n + 250 - 25d - 25n = 75 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -15d - 20n + 250 = 75 \]

Subtract 250 from both sides:
\[ -15d - 20n = -175 \]

Divide the entire equation by -5:
\[ 3d + 4n = 35 \]

Now we have a simpler equation:
\[ 3d + 4n = 35 \]

We need to find integer solutions for \( d \) and \( n \) that satisfy this equation. Let's test possible values for \( d \):

- If \( d = 1 \):
  \[ 3(1) + 4n = 35 \]
  \[ 3 + 4n = 35 \]
  \[ 4n = 32 \]
  \[ n = 8 \]

  So, \( d = 1 \) and \( n = 8 \) is a solution. Let's check the value of \( q \):
  \[ q = 10 - d - n = 10 - 1 - 8 = 1 \]

  The total value is:
  \[ 10(1) + 5(8) + 25(1) = 10 + 40 + 25 = 75 \]

  This solution is correct.

- If \( d = 5 \):
  \[ 3(5) + 4n = 35 \]
  \[ 15 + 4n = 35 \]
  \[ 4n = 20 \]
  \[ n = 5 \]

  So, \( d = 5 \) and \( n = 5 \) is another solution. Let's check the value of \( q \):
  \[ q = 10 - d - n = 10 - 5 - 5 = 0 \]

  The total value is:
  \[ 10(5) + 5(5) + 25(0) = 50 + 25 + 0 = 75 \]

  This solution is also correct.

- If \( d = 9 \):
  \[ 3(9) + 4n = 35 \]
  \[ 27 + 4n = 35 \]
  \[ 4n = 8 \]
  \[ n = 2 \]

  So, \( d = 9 \) and \( n = 2 \) is another solution. Let's check the value of \( q \):
  \[ q = 10 - d - n = 10 - 9 - 2 = -1 \]

  This solution is not valid because \( q \) cannot be negative.

Therefore, the possible solutions are \( (d, n, q) = (1, 8, 1) \) and \( (d, n, q) = (5, 5, 0) \). Since the problem asks for the number of nickels, the possible values are 8 or 5. However, the problem does not specify which solution is correct, so we can provide both as possible answers. But typically, problems like this expect a unique solution, so we should verify which one is more likely or if there is additional context that suggests one is more correct.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse kies is even, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. Specifically, the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the first 11 prime numbers:**
   The first 11 prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.

2. **Classify the prime numbers as even or odd:**
   - The only even prime number is 2.
   - The rest of the prime numbers are odd: 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31.

3. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   Paul and Jesse each choose one of the 11 prime numbers. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:
   \[
   11 \times 11 = 121
   \]

4. **Count the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - **Case 1: Both Paul and Jesse choose even prime numbers.**
     Since there is only one even prime number (2), there is only one way for both to choose 2:
     \[
     1 \times 1 = 1
     \]
   - **Case 2: Both Paul and Jesse choose odd prime numbers.**
     There are 10 odd prime numbers, so the number of ways for both to choose an odd prime number is:
     \[
     10 \times 10 = 100
     \]

   The total number of favorable outcomes is the sum of the outcomes from both cases:
   \[
   1 + 100 = 101
   \]

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse kies is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   \frac{101}{121}
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse kies is even is \(\boxed{\frac{101}{121}}\).","[101/121, '\\frac{101}{121}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) when the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \) and \( a = 4 \), we can follow these steps:

2. Solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

To isolate \( 2b \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of the two triangles that are shaded. The two triangles are part of a 1 by 1 square that is divided into three smaller regions, and the shaded regions are the top two triangles.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the triangles:
- The first triangle has a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units.
- The second triangle has a base of 1 unit and a height of 4 units.

The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Let's calculate the area of the first triangle:
\[
\text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the second triangle:
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that contains only the digits 0 and 1, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25 = 2 \times 225 \]

We need to find a number that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 0 and 1. Let's denote this number by \( N \). Since \( N \) must be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. 

1. **Divisibility by 2**: \( N \) must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: \( N \) must end in 00 or 25. Since \( N \) can only contain the digits 0 and 1, \( N \) must end in 00.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of \( N \) must be divisible by 9. Since \( N \) can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of the digits of \( N \) is simply the number of 1's in \( N \). Therefore, the number of 1's in \( N \) must be divisible by 9.

Given that \( N \) must end in 00, the smallest number that meets all these conditions is 11111111100. Let's verify this:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 25.
- The sum of the digits is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \), which is divisible by 9.
- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the process of determining the two numbers and the probability that the resulting four-digit number is a palindrome.

1. **Understanding the Process:**
   - The first number is obtained by dividing a number by 4 and taking the remainder. The remainder can be 1, 2, or 3.
   - The second number is obtained by dividing a number by 5 and taking the remainder. The remainder can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The two numbers are then combined to form a four-digit number. For example, if the first number is 1 and the second number is 2, the four-digit number is 12.

2. **Identifying the Four-Digit Palindromes:**
   - A four-digit palindrome has the form \( abba \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are digits. This means the first and fourth digits are the same, and the second and third digits are the same.
   - The first digit \( a \) can be any digit from 1 to 9 (since it is a four-digit number), and the second digit \( b \) can be any digit from 0 to 9.

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Possible Four-Digit Numbers:**
   - The first number can be any of 3 possible remainders (1, 2, or 3).
   - The second number can be any of 4 possible remainders (1, 2, 3, or 4).
   - Therefore, the total number of possible four-digit numbers is \( 3 \times 4 = 12 \).

4. **Calculating the Number of Four-Digit Palindromes:**
   - The first digit \( a \) can be any of 9 possible digits (1 to 9).
   - The second digit \( b \) can be any of 10 possible digits (0 to 9).
   - Therefore, the total number of four-digit palindromes is \( 9 \times 10 = 90 \).

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that the four-digit number is a palindrome is the ratio of the number of four-digit palindromes to the total number of possible four-digit numbers.
   - This probability is \( \frac{90}{12} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \).

However, since the probability must be a value between 0 and 1, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the probability is the ratio of the number of four-digit palindromes to the total number of possible four-digit numbers, which is \( \frac{90}{12} = \frac{15}{2} = 7.5 \).

Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).","[1/4, '\\frac{1}{4}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

This fraction can be written as a decimal by moving the decimal point 7 places to the left in the number 4321:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605\]

Next, we identify the digits in the finite decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, 5. Note that leading zeros do not affect the value of the decimal, so we only consider the non-zero digits.

Now, we sum these digits:
\[2 + 1 + 6 + 5 = 14\]

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \frac{3}{4} \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Therefore, the original expression is:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by substituting \( x+5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[ g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015. \]

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( g(r-5) = f((r-5)+5) = f(r) = 0 \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To determine how many sides a convex polygon has if the sum of its interior angles, excluding the smallest one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles excluding the smallest one:**
   Let the smallest interior angle be \(a\). Then the sum of the interior angles excluding the smallest one is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - a
   \]
   According to the problem, this sum is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - a = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Find the range for the smallest angle \(a\):**
   In a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the smallest angle \(a\) is greater than \(0^\circ\) and less than \(180^\circ\).

4. **Estimate the number of sides \(n\):**
   Since \(a\) is positive, we can approximate the total sum of the interior angles by considering the maximum possible value for \(a\), which is just less than \(180^\circ\). For a rough estimate, we can use:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ} \approx 6.9444
   \]
   Rounding up to the nearest whole number, we get:
   \[
   n \approx 9
   \]

5. **Verify the exact number of sides:**
   Let's check if \(n = 9\) works. The total sum of the interior angles of a 9-sided polygon is:
   \[
   (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of the interior angles excluding the smallest one is \(1070^\circ\), then the smallest angle \(a\) is:
   \[
   a = 1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ
   \]
   Since \(190^\circ\) is greater than \(180^\circ\), \(n = 9\) is not possible.

6. **Check \(n = 8\):**
   The total sum of the interior angles of an 8-sided polygon is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of the interior angles excluding the smallest one is \(1070^\circ\), then the smallest angle \(a\) is:
   \[
   a = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(10^\circ\) is less than \(180^\circ\), \(n = 8\) is possible.

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of one side of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces on the cube.

**Step 1: Determine the length of one side of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the length of one side of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the value of \( s \), we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces on the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total surface area \( SA \) is:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This is because the radical conjugate of a number that contains a square root is obtained by changing the sign in front of the square root.

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). We can use the difference of squares formula for this purpose. The difference of squares formula states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Applying the formula, we get:

(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[

"The given sequence is \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\). This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

Setting this equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.

We need to check if these solutions are valid. Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) are defined for all real \(x\), both solutions are valid.

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel. Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors, which will give us the direction vector of the line perpendicular to both lines. This vector can be found using the cross product of \(\mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4)) = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \mathbf{0}.
\]
Since the cross product is the zero vector, the direction vectors are parallel, and we need to find a vector that is perpendicular to one of the direction vectors. We can use the direction vector of one of the lines, say \(\mathbf{d}_1\), and find a vector from a point on the first line to a point on the second line.

\]
Now, we need to find the projection of \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0)\) onto \(\mathbf{d}_1\):
\[
\text{proj}_{\mathbf{d}_1} (\mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0)) = \frac{(\mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0)) \cdot \mathbf{d}_1}{\mathbf{d}_1 \cdot \mathbf{d}_1} \mathbf{d}_1 = \frac{\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}}{\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-16 - 63 - 10}{4 + 81 + 4} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \frac{-89}{89} \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = -\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 9 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The vector from the point on the first line to the point on the second line that is perpendicular to the direction vector is \(\begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 9 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). The distance between the two lines is the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} -2 \\ 9 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + 9^2 + 2^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

\[

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

Now, we divide the total price by the total number of seëls sold to find the average price:
\[\text{Total number of seëls sold} = 12 + 12 + 6 = 30\]
\[\text{Average price} = \frac{228 \text{ sent}}{30} = 7.6 \text{ sent}\]

Rounding 7.6 to the nearest tenth, we get 7.6. Therefore, the average price of Juan's seëls in the 70s is \(\boxed{7.6}\).","[7.60000000000000, '7.6']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the angles in the trapezium. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Let \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \alpha\). Therefore, \(\angle BAD = 2\alpha\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). In \(\triangle ACD\), the area is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ABC\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin(2\alpha)
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD]
\]

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin(2\alpha) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\) in \(\triangle ACD\), we can express \(CD\) as:
\[
CD = AC \cdot \tan(90^\circ - \alpha) = AC \cdot \cot \alpha
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezium minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 21 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\boxed{21}

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by \(-19\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19} = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:**
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To find the vereenvoudigde waarde van \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we start by using the definition of the operation @. According to the definition, \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\). Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

To simplify this, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = \frac{70 \times 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

3. **Number of Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points appear in an alternating pattern. For example, if we fix point \(A\), the points \(C, B, D\) must appear in the order \(C, B, D\) or \(D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:

Thus, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the smaller circle. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the circles and the sectors.

1. **Identify the radii of the circles:**
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(R\).
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(r\).

2. **Given information:**
   - The total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi R^2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi r^2\).

3. **Calculate the area of the shaded regions:**
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi R^2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi r^2\).
   - The total area of the shaded regions is \(\pi R^2 - \pi r^2 = \pi (R^2 - r^2)\).
   - According to the problem, this area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
     \[
     \pi (R^2 - r^2) = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2

   - Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):

4. **Determine the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle subtended by the arc of the smaller circle that is part of the shaded region.
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is \(\frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta\).
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle is also the area of the sector of the larger circle that corresponds to the same angle \(\theta\), which is \(\frac{1}{2} R^2 \theta\).
   - The area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. However, since the problem only gives the total area of the shaded regions, we can use the fact that the area of the sector of the smaller circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
     \]
   - Substitute \(r = R \frac{\sqrt{21}}{6}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \left(R \frac{\sqrt{21}}{6}\right)^2 \theta = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2

     \[
     \frac{7}{24} \theta = \frac{5}{12} \pi

     \theta = \frac{5}{12} \pi \cdot \frac{24}{7} = \frac{10}{7} \pi

   - Convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:
     \[
     \theta = \frac{10}{7} \pi \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10}{7} \cdot 180 = \frac{1800}{7} \approx 257.14^\circ

"To determine how much water the cylindrical beaker can hold to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tank and then find the difference between these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we find the difference between the volume of the spherical tank and the volume of the cylindrical beaker to determine how much water the cylindrical beaker can hold to fill the spherical tank:
\[ V_{\text{difference}} = V_{\text{sphere}} - V_{\text{cylinder}} = 288\pi - 72\pi = 216\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive whole numbers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three numbers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error or by using logical reasoning. Let's try some values for \(x\):

If \(x = 4\):
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120.\]
This is true, so \(x = 4\) is a solution.

If \(x = 5\):
\[5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 210.\]
This is greater than 120, so \(x = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(x = 3\):
\[3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 60.\]
This is less than 120, so \(x = 3\) is not a solution.

Therefore, the only solution is \(x = 4\). The three consecutive whole numbers are 4, 5, and 6.

Next, we need to verify the second condition of the problem, which states that the product of the three numbers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three numbers is:
\[\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5.\]
Now, we check the product divided by the average:
\[\frac{4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24.\]
This condition is also satisfied.

Finally, the largest of the three consecutive whole numbers is 6. Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so \(16x = \frac{16\pi}{15}\). Therefore, we have:
\[

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

Thus, the original expression is:

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is equilateral with \(AB = AC\) and the height \(AM = 11\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\). We also know that there is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote the side length of the equilateral triangle \(ABC\) by \(s\). The height \(AM\) of an equilateral triangle can be expressed as:
\[
AM = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s
\]
Given that \(AM = 11\), we can solve for \(s\):
\[
\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} s = 11 \implies s = \frac{22}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}
\]

Next, we need to use the information about point \(D\) and the angle \(\angle BDC\). Since \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) and \(AD = 10\), the length \(DM\) is:
\[
DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1
\]

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Since \(\angle BAC = 60^\circ\) in an equilateral triangle, we have:
\[
\angle BDC = 3 \times 60^\circ = 180^\circ
\]
However, this interpretation seems incorrect because \(\angle BDC\) cannot be \(180^\circ\) in a triangle. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct geometric interpretation.

The correct interpretation is that \(\angle BDC = 3 \times 30^\circ = 90^\circ\) if we consider the correct angle relationships in the triangle. This is a known geometric property for an equilateral triangle with a point \(D\) on the height such that the angle subtended by the base at \(D\) is three times the angle at the vertex.

Given this, we can use the fact that in an equilateral triangle, the height \(AM\) splits the triangle into two 30-60-90 right triangles. The side length \(s\) can be found using the height:
\[
s = \frac{22\sqrt{3}}{3}

The perimeter of the equilateral triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive positive integers is given by the formula:

\[

\]

However, since we are dealing with 27 consecutive positive integers, we can use the property that the sum of \(n\) consecutive integers is \(n\) times the average of the first and last integers. For 27 consecutive integers, the sum is also equal to \(27\) times the middle integer (since the median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle integer).

Given that the sum of these 27 consecutive integers is \(3^7\), we can write:

\[

Next, we simplify the right-hand side of the equation. We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so:

To find the median, we divide both sides of the equation by 27:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative, i.e., \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). Since \(0 > -4\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

So, the solution to the first inequality is all real numbers, which can be written as \((- \infty, \infty)\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\).

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]
This gives us two roots: \(y = \frac{6}{2} = 3\) and \(y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \(-7 < y < 3\).

Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the part of the solution where \(y < -7\). Thus, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\), which can be written as \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions to both inequalities, we get the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) as the intersection of \((- \infty, \infty)\) and \((- \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\), which is \((- \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
12 = s p - 3 \cdot 4.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
12 = sp - 12.
\]
Adding 12 to both sides, we get:
\[
24 = sp.
\]
Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).
From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right).
\]
Multiplying through by \(s\), we get:
\[
-8s = s^3 - 72.

The expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which is always non-negative. The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\), which changes sign at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or when the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator is always non-negative, the only way the inequality can hold is if the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative.

So, we need to solve:
\[
|x^2 - 81| > 0 \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 - 36x < 0.
\]
The inequality \(|x^2 - 81| > 0\) is true for all \(x\) except \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). The inequality \(x^2 - 36x < 0\) is true for \(0 < x < 36\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the intersection of these two sets:
\[
(-\infty, -9) \cup (-9, 9) \cup (9, 36).

"To find the maximum possible area of the veld, we need to consider the shape of the veld and the given perimeter of the track. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total perimeter of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of each straight side by \( L \) and the radius of each semicircle by \( R \). The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi R \), so the total perimeter is:
\[
2L + 2\pi R = 400
\]
We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[
L + \pi R = 200
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( R \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi R
\]

The area \( A \) of the veld is the sum of the area of the rectangle formed by the two straight sides and the area of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times 2R \) (since the width of the rectangle is the diameter of the semicircle, which is \( 2R \)), and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 \), so the total area is:
\[
A = L \times 2R + 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi R^2 = 2LR + \pi R^2
\]
Substituting \( L = 200 - \pi R \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = 2(200 - \pi R)R + \pi R^2 = 400R - 2\pi R^2 + \pi R^2 = 400R - \pi R^2
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dR} = 400 - 2\pi R = 0
\]
Solving for \( R \), we get:
\[
2\pi R = 400 \implies R = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Substituting \( R = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 200 = 0
\]
This result indicates that the straight sides are zero, which is not possible for a veld. Therefore, we need to consider the boundary conditions or the practical constraints of the problem. However, the problem is typically set up to find the maximum area for a given perimeter, and the above calculation shows that the maximum area is achieved when the straight sides are as long as possible, which is when the semicircles are as small as possible.

Given the constraints and the typical setup of such problems, the maximum area is achieved when the semicircles are as small as possible, which is when the straight sides are as long as possible. The maximum area is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by understanding the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the sine function. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can denote the length of the side opposite to angle \(R\) as \(2k\) and the hypotenuse as \(5k\), where \(k\) is a positive constant. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\):

\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + \text{opposite}^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 = 21k^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent} = \sqrt{21}k
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary (they add up to \(90^\circ\)), we have \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\). The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Therefore,

\[
\sin{T} = \cos{R}
\]

We can find \(\cos{R}\) using the adjacent side and the hypotenuse:

\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus,

"To find the smallest distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we find \(a + b\):

\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixteenth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the structure of the octahedron and the given distances. A regular octahedron has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other.

Given the distances from \( P \) to the first five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Since the octahedron is regular, the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices must be equal. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex must be the same as the distance from \( P \) to the vertex opposite to the fifth vertex.

The fifth vertex has a distance of 11 from \( P \). The opposite vertex must have the same distance. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is also 11.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixteenth vertex is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To solve the problem, we need to use the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where:
- \( F \) is the force (or mass in this context),
- \( m \) is the mass,
- \( a \) is the acceleration (or versnelling in this context).

In this problem, the force applied by both Jen and Jack is the same because they are both experiencing the same gravitational force. Let's denote this force by \( F \).

For Jen:
- The mass of her ball is \( m_J = 200 \) g.
- The acceleration of her ball is \( a_J \).

Using Newton's second law, we have:
\[ F = m_J \cdot a_J \]
\[ F = 200 \cdot a_J \]

For Jack:
- The mass of his ball is \( m_K = 150 \) g.
- The acceleration of his ball is \( a_K \).

Using Newton's second law again, we have:
\[ F = m_K \cdot a_K \]
\[ F = 150 \cdot a_K \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both Jen and Jack, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_K \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \):
\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:
\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the versnelling of Jen's ball to Jack's ball is:

"To determine how many of the same digits are present in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in both representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). The digits present in both representations are 1, 5, and 6. The digit 1 appears once in both representations, the digit 5 appears twice in the base 7 representation and once in the base 8 representation, and the digit 6 appears once in the base 7 representation and once in the base 8 representation.

   - There are 6 hekse.
   - There are 6 towenaars.

2. **Determine the actions taken by the hekse:**
   - Each hekse decides to hand over their hande to each of the towenaars.
   - Since there are 6 hekse and each hekse hands over their hande to 6 towenaars, the total number of handdrukke given by the hekse is:

3. **Determine the actions taken by the towenaars:**
   - Each towenaar receives hande from each of the hekse.
   - Since there are 6 towenaars and each towenaar receives hande from 6 hekse, the total number of handdrukke received by the towenaars is:
     \[

   - However, each towenaar also gives hande to each of the other 5 towenaars, so each towenaar gives away a total of:
     \[
     5 \text{ towenaars} \times 6 \text{ hekse} = 30 \text{ handdrukke}

   - Therefore, the net number of handdrukke received by each towenaar is:
     \[
     36 \text{ handdrukke} - 30 \text{ handdrukke} = 6 \text{ handdrukke}

"To determine the cost of a pot of coffee in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the cost of the large pot of coffee from dollars to cents.
2. Convert the cost of the small pot of coffee from dollars to cents.
3. Find the cost of one pot of coffee in cents.

First, let's convert the cost of the large pot of coffee from dollars to cents. The cost of the large pot is \$1.24. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply \$1.24 by 100:
\[
1.24 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 124 \text{ cents}
\]

Next, let's convert the cost of the small pot of coffee from dollars to cents. The cost of the small pot is \$1.82. Again, we multiply \$1.82 by 100:
\[
1.82 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 182 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we find the cost of one pot of coffee by adding the cost of the large pot and the cost of the small pot:
\[
124 \text{ cents} + 182 \text{ cents} = 306 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the cost of a pot of coffee is \(\boxed{306}\) cents.","[306, '306']",29,"[29, '29']",False
"To determine the last non-zero digit of the rightmost non-zero digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to find the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\).

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \div 1}{500 \div 1} = \frac{137}{500}
\]
Since 137 and 500 have no common factors other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit in this sequence is 4.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four corner points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The rectangle has vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The condition that a point \(P\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the corner points can be expressed using the distance formula. Specifically, \(P\) must satisfy:
\[ OP < PA, \quad OP < PB, \quad OP < PC, \quad OP < PD. \]

The set of points inside the rectangle that are closer to \(O\) than to any corner point forms a smaller rectangle with center \(O\) and sides parallel to the sides of the original rectangle. The vertices of this smaller rectangle are the points on the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) that are equidistant from \(O\) as the corner points.

To find the dimensions of the smaller rectangle, we note that the distance from \(O\) to each corner point is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot AB\) (since \(AB = AD = k\)). The distance from \(O\) to the side of the smaller rectangle that is parallel to \(AB\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} \cdot k\). Therefore, the side length of the smaller rectangle is \(k\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[ \left(\frac{k}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{k^2}{2}. \]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[ k^2. \]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four corner points is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[ \frac{\frac{k^2}{2}}{k^2} = \frac{1}{2}. \]

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie had in total and how much of that amount was overruled by the bank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they had before any deductions.
2. Determine the maximum amount of money that can be covered by the bank notes.
3. Find the difference between the total amount and the maximum amount that can be covered by the bank notes.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they had before any deductions:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Linda's amount} + \text{Sherry's amount} + \text{June's amount} + \text{Connie's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they had before any deductions is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine the maximum amount of money that can be covered by the bank notes. Since the problem does not specify the denominations of the bank notes, we will assume that the bank notes are in the highest denominations possible to cover the total amount. The highest denominations in the US are \$100, \$50, \$20, \$10, \$5, \$1, \$0.25, \$0.10, \$0.05, and \$0.01.

To find the maximum amount that can be covered by the bank notes, we need to consider the largest possible combination of these denominations that does not exceed \$126.59. The largest denomination is \$100, so we start with that:
\[
100 + 26.59 = 126.59
\]

Since \$126.59 is exactly equal to \$100 plus \$26.59, the maximum amount that can be covered by the bank notes is \$126.59.

Finally, we find the difference between the total amount and the maximum amount that can be covered by the bank notes:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Maximum amount covered by bank notes}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 126.59 - 126.59 = 0

Therefore, the amount of money that was overruled by the bank is \(\boxed{0}\) cents.","[0, '0']",59,"[59, '59']",False
"To find the class average, we need to calculate the total score of all students and then divide that by the number of students. Here are the steps:

   - 8 students scored 90: \(8 \times 90 = 720\)
   - 2 students scored 100: \(2 \times 100 = 200\)

2. Add these totals together to get the overall total score:

3. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students to get the class average:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 4 \times 4 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the magic square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 & n+2 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 & 3 \\
\hline
n-1 & 2 & n+2 & n-3 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We will start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 3n + 3 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 + 2 = 3n - 4
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
3n - 4 = 3n + 3
\]
Subtracting \( 3n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
-4 = 3
\]
This is a contradiction, which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + (n-1) = 3n
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 3n \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n + 2 = 3n - 4
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
3n - 4 = 3n
\]
Subtracting \( 3n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
-4 = 0
\]
This is also a contradiction, which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) + (n+2) = 5n - 11
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 5n - 11 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + (n-1) + (n-3) = 5n - 11
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
5n - 11 = 5n - 11
\]
This is true, so the common sum \( S \) is indeed \( 5n - 11 \).

Now, we need to find the value of \( n \) that satisfies all these conditions. We can use the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
3n + 3 = 5n - 11
\]
Subtracting \( 3n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
3 = 2n - 11
\]
Adding 11 to both sides, we get:
\[
14 = 2n
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
n = 7
\]

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Martha loops Jim, we need to calculate the perimeter of the reghoekige veld and then find the difference in the distances they each loop.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the reghoekige veld. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \]

Given that the length is 400 feet and the breadth is 300 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet} \]

So, the perimeter of the veld is 1400 feet. This is the distance each of them loops.

Since both Jim and Martha loop the same perimeter, the difference in the distances they loop is:
\[ 0 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Martha loops \(\boxed{0}\) feet less than Jim.","[0, '0']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, we know that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

- \( AB = 5 \)
- \( AC = 6 \)
- \( AD = 5 \)
- \( BC = 6 \)
- \( BD = 3 \)
- \( CD = 4 \)

The shortest distance from \( A \) to any of the points \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) is \( BD = 3 \).

Now, we need to find the shortest path that starts at \( A \), visits \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) exactly once each, and returns to \( A \). This is a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) with 4 points.

We will consider all possible permutations of the points \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) and calculate the total distance for each permutation.

1. Path \( A \to B \to C \to D \to A \):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD + DA = 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 20

2. Path \( A \to B \to D \to C \to A \):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC + CA = 5 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 18

3. Path \( A \to C \to B \to D \to A \):
   \[
