"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) where \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\), \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\), and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), we start by noting that \(DE\) is the horizontal distance between the points \(D\) and \(E\). Since both points have the same \(y\)-coordinate, the distance \(DE\) is simply the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates.

The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51} - 0 = \sqrt{51}
\]

The given information that \(\sin D = 0.7\) is not necessary to find the length of \(DE\) because the length of \(DE\) depends only on the \(x\)-coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\).

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( z \) is obtained by rotating \( c \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can use the formula for rotating a complex number \( z \) around another complex number \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), \( c = 2 - 3i \), and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). First, we need to find \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \]

Next, we need to find \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We use the distributive property to expand this product:

\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})(-1)\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3\sqrt{2} - 6)i\frac{1}{2} + (-3\sqrt{2} + 6)\frac{1}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i + \left( \frac{-3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} \right) \]
\[ = 1 + \frac{-3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} + \left( 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = \frac{2 - 3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} + \left( \frac{2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + \left( \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \right) \]
\[ = \left( 2 + \frac{8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( -3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = \left( \frac{4 + 8 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{-6 + 3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = \left( \frac{12 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 10}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = \frac{12 - 3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 10}{2}i \]

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[
242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
\]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine how many ways 8 people can sit around a table with 3 specific people (P, R, and T) sitting together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat P, R, and T as a single unit**: Since P, R, and T must sit together, we can consider them as one ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the PRT block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

2. **Arrange the units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around a table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange P, R, and T within their block**: Within the PRT block, P, R, and T can sit in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table with P, R, and T sitting together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange P, R, and T within their block. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table with 3 specific people sitting together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term \(T_k\) becomes:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Now, multiply these values together:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) is divided by 7. Let's start by substituting \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression.

First, we calculate each term in the product:
\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4,
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6,
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8.
\]

Now, we need to find the remainders of these terms when divided by 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Thus, the expression \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) modulo 7 becomes:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

Now, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the square, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles. The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the given vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is calculated as follows:

\[
\left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the midpoint:

\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

From these equations, we can solve for \(x\) and \(y\):

\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((4, 7)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so we need to consider the other possible configuration of the square. The other diagonal of the square can be found by rotating the given diagonal by 90 degrees. The slope of the given diagonal is:

\[
\frac{8-3}{6-5} = 5
\]

The slope of the perpendicular diagonal is the negative reciprocal, which is \(-\frac{1}{5}\). The equation of the perpendicular diagonal passing through the midpoint \(\left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)\) is:

\[
y - \frac{11}{2} = -\frac{1}{5} \left( x - \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
y - \frac{11}{2} = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{11}{10} \implies y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{11}{2} + \frac{11}{10} \implies y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{66}{10} \implies y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{33}{5}
\]

We also know that the length of the diagonal is the same as the length of the given diagonal:

\[
\sqrt{(6-5)^2 + (8-3)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 25} = \sqrt{26}
\]

The length of the other diagonal is also \(\sqrt{26}\). Let the coordinates of the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\). The distance from \((7, 4)\) to \((x, y)\) is:

\[
\sqrt{(x-7)^2 + (y-4)^2} = \sqrt{26}
\]

Substituting \(y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{33}{5}\) into the distance equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{(x-7)^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{33}{5} - 4 \right)^2} = \sqrt{26}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root:

\[
\sqrt{(x-7)^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{33}{5} - \frac{20}{5} \right)^2} = \sqrt{26} \implies \sqrt{(x-7)^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{13}{5} \right)^2} = \sqrt{26}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
(x-7)^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{13}{5} \right)^2 = 26
\]

Expanding both terms:

\[
x^2 - 14x + 49 + \frac{1}{25}x^2 - \frac{26}{25}x + \frac{169}{25} = 26
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
\frac{26}{25}x^2 - \frac{366}{25}x + \frac{1424}{25} = 26
\]

Multiplying through by 25:

\[
26x^2 - 366x + 1424 = 650
\]

Rearranging terms:

\[
26x^2 - 366x + 774 = 0
\]

Dividing through by 2:

\[
13x^2 - 183x + 387 = 0
\]

Using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):

\[
x = \frac{183 \pm \sqrt{183^2 - 4 \cdot 13 \cdot 387}}{2 \cdot 13} = \frac{183 \pm \sqrt{33489 - 19932}}{26} = \frac{183 \pm \sqrt{13557}}{26} = \frac{183 \pm 116.43}{26}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{300}{26} = \frac{150}{13} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{67}{26}
\]

Since \(x > 7\), we take \(x = \frac{150}{13}\). Substituting \(x = \frac{150}{13}\) back into the equation \(y = -\frac{1}{5}x + \frac{33}{5}\):

\[
y = -\frac{1}{5} \cdot \frac{150}{13} + \frac{33}{5} = -\frac{30}{13} + \frac{33}{5} = -\frac{150}{65} + \frac{429}{65} = \frac{279}{65}
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \(\left( \frac{150}{13}, \frac{279}{65} \right)\). The sum \(x + y\) is:

\[
\frac{150}{13} + \frac{279}{65} = \frac{750}{65} + \frac{279}{65} = \frac{1029}{65}

"To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes (where the function is undefined) and the horizontal asymptote.

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0,\]
\[x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator \(P(x) = 2x\) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \(Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14\) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). So, \(c = 0\).

Now, we need to find the sum \(a + b + c\):
\[a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.\]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b + c\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

"To find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16)

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[

Thus, we have:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we first need to convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10, perform the subtraction in base 10, and then convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10
The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53\]
So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17\]
So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9
To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:
\[
\cot x.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of tricycles that have the same total weight as a bicycle and a tricycle. Let's denote the weight of a bicycle as \( B \) and the weight of a tricycle as \( T \).

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. The total weight of 5 tricycles, 3 bicycles, and 1 tricycle is equal to the total weight of 3 tricycles and 1 bicycle.
2. The total weight of 2 tricycles and 1 bicycle is equal to the total weight of 1 bicycle and 1 tricycle.

First, let's use the second piece of information to find the relationship between the weights of a bicycle and a tricycle:
\[ 2T + B = B + T \]
Subtract \( B \) from both sides:
\[ 2T = T \]
Subtract \( T \) from both sides:
\[ T = 0 \]

This result, \( T = 0 \), means that the weight of a tricycle is 0. Therefore, the weight of a bicycle is \( B \).

Now, let's use the first piece of information to verify the relationship:
\[ 5T + 3B + T = 3T + B \]
Substitute \( T = 0 \):
\[ 5(0) + 3B + 0 = 3(0) + B \]
\[ 3B = B \]
Subtract \( B \) from both sides:
\[ 2B = 0 \]
Subtract \( 2B \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = 0 \]

This equation is true, confirming that our value for \( T \) is correct.

Now, we need to find the number of tricycles that have the same total weight as a bicycle and a tricycle. Since \( T = 0 \), the total weight of a bicycle and a tricycle is:
\[ B + T = B + 0 = B \]

The weight of one tricycle is \( T = 0 \), so the number of tricycles that have the same total weight as a bicycle and a tricycle is:
\[ \frac{B}{T} = \frac{B}{0} \]

However, since \( T = 0 \), the number of tricycles is undefined in this context. Therefore, the problem is not well-posed in terms of finding a finite number of tricycles.

Given the constraints and the logical steps, the correct interpretation is that the problem is not solvable in the context of finite tricycles. However, if we were to consider the problem in a different context where the weight of a tricycle is not zero, the number of tricycles would be 1.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides, we have:
\[
3b = 6
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
b = 2
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substituting \(b = 2\) into the equation, we have:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we have:
\[
4a = -12
\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we get:
\[
a = -3

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16

Substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation, we have:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16

Simplifying, we get:
\[
-10 - 6 = -16

\[
-16 = -16

This equation is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

By comparing the constant terms, we get:

-2a = 6

Substituting \(a = -3\) into the equation, we have:
\[
-2(-3) = 6
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
6 = 6

This equation is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):

Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each line segment at most once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) piecewise and ensure that the function does not intersect itself within the given intervals.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ 
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. 
\end{cases} \]

First, let's consider the quadratic piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The vertex of this parabola is at \(x = 0\), but since we are only considering \(x \geq a\), the function is increasing for \(x \geq a\) if \(a > 0\) and decreasing for \(x \geq a\) if \(a < 0\).

Next, let's consider the linear piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). The value of this function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each line segment at most once, the value of the quadratic piece at \(x = a\) must be greater than or equal to the value of the linear piece at \(x = a\). This ensures that the parabola does not intersect the line at \(x = a\) and that the parabola does not intersect the line at any other point.

Therefore, we need:
\[ a^2 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]

Subtracting \(a^2\) from both sides, we get:
\[ 0 \geq 2a, \]
or
\[ a \leq 0. \]

Since \(a\) is a positive number, the only solution is \(a = 0\). However, \(a = 0\) is not a valid solution because it would make the function \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which does not satisfy the condition of intersecting each line segment at most once.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each line segment at most once is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a diameter of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form of a circle's equation, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. The diameter of the circle is \(2r\), so if the diameter is 1, then the radius \( r \) is \(\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, we have:
\[ r^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \]

So, we set the right side of our equation equal to \(\frac{1}{4}\):
\[ 34 - c = \frac{1}{4} \]
To solve for \( c \), we first isolate \( c \) by subtracting 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = \frac{1}{4} - 34 \]
Next, we convert 34 to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ 34 = \frac{136}{4} \]
So, we have:
\[ -c = \frac{1}{4} - \frac{136}{4} = \frac{1 - 136}{4} = \frac{-135}{4} \]
Multiplying both sides by \(-1\), we get:
\[ c = \frac{135}{4} \]

"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) and \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) has no fixed points but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the fixed points of \(f(x)\):**
   A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\). Therefore, we solve:
   \[
   \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
   \]
   Rearranging terms, we get:
   \[
   \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
   \]
   For \(x\) to be in the interval \([0, 1]\), we need:
   \[
   0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
   \]
   This inequality holds if and only if:
   \[
   0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies 1 \le \lambda \le 4.
   \]
   Therefore, the fixed points of \(f(x)\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\).

2. **Find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\):**
   We need to find \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). First, we compute \(f(f(x))\):
   \[
   f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x),
   \]
   \[
   f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
   \]
   We need:
   \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
   \]
   For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
   \]
   Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
   \[
   \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,
   \]
   \[
   \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,
   \]
   \[
   \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
   \]
   This is a cubic equation in \(x\):
   \[
   \lambda^4 x^3 - 2\lambda^3 x^2 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 1 - \lambda^2 = 0.
   \]
   For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have no fixed points other than \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), the cubic equation must have no other solutions in \([0, 1]\) except \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). This occurs when the discriminant of the cubic equation is zero or when the roots are such that the function \(f(f(x)) - x\) has no other roots in \([0, 1]\) except the fixed points of \(f(x)\).

   By analyzing the function and its properties, we find that the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies this condition is \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function becomes:
   \[
   f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2,
   \]
   and the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The function \(f(f(x)) = x\) has no other solutions in \([0, 1]\) except \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\).

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ + \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To find the value of \(\theta\) that minimizes this expression, we can use the fact that \(\cos 25^\circ \approx \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ \approx \cos 65^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta \approx \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, we have:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 35^\circ.

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9

Therefore, the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will analyze the function and its behavior at the boundary points and critical points.

First, let's consider the boundary points. The boundary points of the domain are the points where \( x \) or \( y \) take the values \( \pm 1 \).

1. **Case 1: \( x = 1 \)**
   \[
   f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), and it is \( \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x = -1 \)**
   \[
   f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), and it is \( -\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1 \).

3. **Case 3: \( y = 1 \)**
   \[
   f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), and it is \( \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \).

4. **Case 4: \( y = -1 \)**
   \[
   f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), and it is \( -\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1 \).

From the above cases, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) at the boundary points is \( 1 \).

Next, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the domain. To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \cdot \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \quad \text{(2)}
\]

From equation (1), we can solve for \( y \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

From equation (2), we can solve for \( x \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

Both equations give us the same condition \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), which means that the critical points lie on the boundary of the domain. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) inside the domain is the same as the maximum value at the boundary points.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the position vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). The number \( \alpha \) is the golden ratio, which satisfies the quadratic equation \( \alpha^2 = \alpha + 1 \).

Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \alpha \), we can consider \( z \) to be a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
\[
z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{(\alpha + 1) - 4}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha - 3}}{2}.
\]
However, since \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \alpha - 3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 3 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} - 6}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is negative. Therefore, the roots are complex and can be written as:
\[
z = \frac{\alpha \pm i\sqrt{5 - \sqrt{5}}}{2}.
\]
These roots are complex numbers on the unit circle, so we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). From the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \alpha \), we have:
\[
e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta = \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
Thus, \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta).
\]
To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) is such that \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden angle, and it can be shown that \( 85\theta \) is an integer multiple of \( 2\pi \) plus \( \theta \) or \( -\theta \). Specifically, \( 85\theta = 2\pi k + \theta \) for some integer \( k \), or \( 85\theta = 2\pi k - \theta \) for some integer \( k \). In either case, \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\theta \) or \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(-\theta) = \cos\theta \). Therefore:
\[
\cos(85\theta) = \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]
Thus:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
The final answer is:

"To find the area of triangle \(MEN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are points on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively such that \(GM \parallel BC\) and \(GN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AGM\) and \(AGN\) are similar to triangle \(ABC\) and each has a ratio of \(2:3\) with respect to triangle \(ABC\).

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its corresponding side lengths. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGM\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), and the same is true for triangle \(AGN\).

The area of triangle \(AGM\) is \(\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64\), and the area of triangle \(AGN\) is also \(\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64\).

The area of quadrilateral \(GMNC\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AGN\):
\[
144 - 64 = 80.
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(GMNC\) can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles \(GMC\) and \(GNC\). Since \(GM \parallel BC\) and \(GN \parallel BC\), triangles \(GMC\) and \(GNC\) are similar to triangle \(ABC\) and each has a ratio of \(2:3\) with respect to triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(GMC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), and the same is true for triangle \(GNC\).

The area of triangle \(GMC\) is \(\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64\), and the area of triangle \(GNC\) is also \(\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64\).

The area of quadrilateral \(GMNC\) is the sum of the areas of triangles \(GMC\) and \(GNC\):
\[
64 + 64 = 128.
\]

However, we have already calculated the area of quadrilateral \(GMNC\) as 80, so there must be a mistake in the interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach is to consider the area of triangle \(MEN\). Since \(GM \parallel BC\) and \(GN \parallel BC\), triangles \(MEN\) and \(ABC\) are similar with a ratio of \(1:3\).

The area of triangle \(MEN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\):

where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. The base of the cone is a circle with a radius of 30 units, so the area of the base \( B \) is given by:

\[ B = \pi r^2 = \pi (30)^2 = 900\pi \]

The height \( h \) of the cone is 6.5 units. Substituting these values into the volume formula, we get:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the 10th term \(a_{10} = 200\) and the 8th term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write:

\[ a_{10} = a_1 + 9d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the 8th term from the equation for the 10th term:

\[ (a_1 + 9d) - (a_1 + 7d) = 200 - 500 \]
\[ 2d = -300 \]
\[ d = -150 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the 10th term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 - 1350 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 1550 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the 11th term \(a_{11}\) using the general formula again:

\[ a_{11} = a_1 + 10d \]
\[ a_{11} = 1550 + 10(-150) \]

"To determine how many nickels Harry has, we need to know the total amount of money he has in cents and the value of each nickel. We know that Harry has 75 cents in total and each nickel is worth 5 cents. We can find the number of nickels by dividing the total amount of money by the value of each nickel.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money Harry has in cents: 75 cents.
2. Identify the value of each nickel: 5 cents.
3. Divide the total amount of money by the value of each nickel to find the number of nickels:
   \[
   \text{Number of nickels} = \frac{75 \text{ cents}}{5 \text{ cents/nickel}} = 15 \text{ nickels}

"To find the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers from 1 to 450 that is divisible by all integers from 1 to 450 except 1 and 450, we need to determine the LCM of the numbers from 2 to 449. The LCM of a set of numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the set.

The LCM of the numbers from 2 to 449 is the product of the highest powers of all prime numbers that are less than or equal to 449. To find this, we need to identify all prime numbers up to 449 and their highest powers that are less than or equal to 449.

First, we list the prime numbers up to 449:

Next, we find the highest power of each prime number that is less than or equal to 449:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^9 = 512\), but since 512 is greater than 449, the highest power of 2 that is less than or equal to 449 is \(2^8 = 256\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^6 = 729\), but since 729 is greater than 449, the highest power of 3 that is less than or equal to 449 is \(3^5 = 243\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^4 = 625\), but since 625 is greater than 449, the highest power of 5 that is less than or equal to 449 is \(5^3 = 125\).
- The highest power of 7 is \(7^3 = 343\), which is less than 449.
- The highest power of 11 is \(11^2 = 121\), which is less than 449.
- The highest power of 13 is \(13^2 = 169\), which is less than 449.
- The highest power of 17 is \(17^2 = 289\), which is less than 449.
- The highest power of 19 is \(19^2 = 361\), which is less than 449.
- The highest power of 23 is \(23^2 = 529\), but since 529 is greater than 449, the highest power of 23 that is less than or equal to 449 is \(23^1 = 23\).

- The highest power of 37 is \(37^1 = 37\).
- The highest power of 41 is \(41^1 = 41\).
- The highest power of 43 is \(43^1 = 43\).
- The highest power of 47 is \(47^1 = 47\).

Therefore, the LCM of the numbers from 2 to 449 is:

   - The first number must be one of the numbers in the bottom row of the checkbook.
   - The second number must be one of the numbers in the rightmost column of the checkbook.

2. **Determine the possible choices for the first number:**
   - The bottom row of the checkbook is \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\).
   - The numbers in the bottom row that are divisible by 4 are \(4, 8\).

   - Therefore, there is 1 possible choice for the second number.

4. **Calculate the total number of ways to fill the checkbook:**
   - Since the choice of the first number is independent of the choice of the second number, we multiply the number of choices for the first number by the number of choices for the second number.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

"To find the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). The polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15
\]

From Vieta's formulas, we know that for the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is equal to the coefficient of \( x^2 \) with the opposite sign, which is 49. Therefore:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49
\]

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:
\[
(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34
\]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). Using this, we can rewrite \(\sin 20^\circ\) as \(\cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) as \(\cos 50^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to rewrite \(\cos^2 70^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cos^2 50^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 40^\circ\). So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) and \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

We can factor out the 2:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 80^\circ} \right).
\]

To simplify the expression inside the parentheses, we use the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\). Thus, \(1 + \cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ\) and \(1 - \cos 40^\circ = 2 \sin^2 20^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)\) and \(1 - \cos 80^\circ = 2 \sin^2 40^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{2 \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 40^\circ} \right).
\]

We can further simplify this by using the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\) again:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

This is the original expression, so we need to find a way to simplify it. We use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) and the fact that the sum of the squares of the cosines of angles in arithmetic progression can be simplified using known trigonometric identities. The sum of the squares of the cosines of 10^\circ, 20^\circ, and 40^\circ is:
\[
\cos^2 10^\circ + \cos^2 20^\circ + \cos^2 40^\circ = \frac{9}{8}.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin^2 x = 1 - \cos^2 x\), we get:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ + \sin^2 40^\circ = 2 - (\cos^2 20^\circ + \cos^2 40^\circ) = 2 - \left( \frac{9}{8} - \cos^2 10^\circ \right) = \frac{7}{8} + \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\frac{7}{8} + \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\frac{7}{8} + \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{2}{\frac{7}{8} + \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{16}{7 + 8 \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos^2 10^\circ = \frac{1 + \cos 20^\circ}{2}\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{4}{3}.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{4}{3} + \frac{16}{7 + 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{4}{3} + \frac{16}{12} = \frac{4}{3} + \frac{4}{3} = \frac{8}{3}.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is:
\[
\boxed{8}.

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, after one of the interior angles is divided into two smaller angles, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Since the sum of all interior angles of the polygon is \( 180(n-2) \) degrees, the measure of the original interior angle that was divided must be the difference between \( 180(n-2) \) and \( 1070 \) degrees. Therefore, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) - \text{(measure of the original interior angle)} = 1070
\]

However, since the measure of the original interior angle is not needed to find \( n \), we can simply use the fact that the sum of the remaining angles is \( 1070^\circ \) and that this is less than the total sum of the interior angles. We can set up the equation:

"To solve for the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to find \( t \) such that:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we get a quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic equation modulo 23, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \) and \( (-x)^2 \) are the same modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( x \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 = -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since both solutions satisfy the original conditions, we can choose either one. The problem does not specify which one to choose, so we can return either solution. For the sake of definiteness, we will return the smaller one:

\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This further simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta).
\]
Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The formula is:

\[ d = \frac{|(\mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2) \cdot (\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2|} \]

where:
- \(\mathbf{b}_1\) and \(\mathbf{b}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively,
- \(\mathbf{d}_1\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2\) are the direction vectors of the first and second lines, respectively.

From the given parametric equations, we can identify:
- \(\mathbf{b}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\),
- \(\mathbf{b}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\),
- \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\),
- \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we check if the direction vectors are parallel. Notice that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the direction vectors are indeed parallel.

Next, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2\):
\[ \mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - (-5) \\ -10 - (-3) \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2\):
\[ \mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4)). \]
\[ = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \mathbf{i}(0) - \mathbf{j}(0) + \mathbf{k}(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Since the cross product is the zero vector, the direction vectors are parallel, and the lines are parallel, not skew. Therefore, the distance between the lines is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line. We can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line in 3D space, but since the direction vector is parallel, the distance is simply the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2\):
\[ d = \frac{|(\mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2) \cdot (\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2|} = \frac{|(\mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2) \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}|}{0} = \text{undefined}. \]

However, since the direction vectors are parallel, the distance is simply the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{b}_1 - \mathbf{b}_2\):
\[ d = \sqrt{8^2 + (-7)^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 49 + 25} = \sqrt{138}. \]

"To determine the number of lattice points inside the given rectangular area, we first need to identify the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle. The vertices are given as \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\).

The length of the rectangle along the x-axis is the distance between \(x = 5\) and \(x = -5\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\). The length of the rectangle along the y-axis is the distance between \(y = 4\) and \(y = -4\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates. To find the number of lattice points inside the rectangle, we need to count all the points \((x, y)\) such that \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\). This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

The number of possible values for \(x\) is \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\). The number of possible values for \(y\) is \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\).

Therefore, the total number of lattice points inside the rectangle is the product of the number of possible values for \(x\) and the number of possible values for \(y\):

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1\) for 2D vectors, but for 3D vectors, it is more complex. However, we can use the properties of the cross product to simplify our calculation.

First, let's expand the expression using the distributive property:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]
Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]
Next, we substitute the given values of the cross products:
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Since \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), we have:
\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Now, substitute these into the expression:
\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

However, this calculation is incorrect because the area of the triangle \(ADC\) should be positive. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct geometric configuration.

"To determine how much of the cylindrical tank is filled with water, we need to calculate the volume of the cylindrical tank and the volume of the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical tank to the volume of the cylindrical tank.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The diameter of the cylindrical tank is 8 cm, so the radius \( r \) is:
\[ r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ cm} \]
The height \( h \) is 10 cm. Therefore, the volume of the cylindrical tank is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (4)^2 (10) = \pi \cdot 16 \cdot 10 = 160\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. The diameter of the spherical tank is 6 cm, so the radius \( r \) is:

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):

"To determine how many ways we can form a committee of 5 members from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats such that each party has at least one member in the committee, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from 14 people:**
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we know that the product of these three integers divided by 24 is equal to the sum of these three integers. Therefore, we can write another equation:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{24} = x + (x+1) + (x+2).\]

Simplifying the right-hand side of the equation, we get:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{24} = 3x + 3.\]

Since we already know that \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\), we can substitute 120 for \(x(x+1)(x+2)\) in the equation:
\[\frac{120}{24} = 3x + 3.\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[5 = 3x + 3.\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
\[2 = 3x.\]

Then, we divide both sides by 3:
\[x = \frac{2}{3}.\]

Since \(x\) must be an integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's check the possible integer values for \(x\) by testing the factors of 120 that are close to the cube root of 120, which is approximately 4.93. The possible integer values for \(x\) are 3, 4, and 5.

Let's test \(x = 3\):
\[3(3+1)(3+2) = 3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 60 \neq 120.\]

Let's test \(x = 4\):
\[4(4+1)(4+2) = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120.\]

So, \(x = 4\) is a solution. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we need to find the value of the largest of these three integers, which is 6.

"To find the value of \( x \) that makes the expression \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\) equal to 16, we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096 \). First, we move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we have:

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

\[

Therefore, the values of \( x \) that satisfy the equation are \( x = 66 \) and \( x = -62 \). The problem asks for the value of \( x \), so we can present the solutions as:

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this in, we get:

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \) with \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle AMB \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{AB}.
\]
From the Pythagorean identity, we get:
\[
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \implies \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{BM}{AB} \right)^2 = 1 \implies \frac{121 + BM^2}{AB^2} = 1 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]

Next, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = \frac{DM}{BM} = \frac{1}{BM} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 3\theta = \frac{BD}{BM} = \frac{BD}{BM}.
\]
From the triple angle identity for sine, we get:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta = \frac{1}{BM}.
\]
Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \), we have:
\[
3 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right) - 4 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^3 = \frac{1}{BM} \implies \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{4 \cdot 1331}{AB^3} = \frac{1}{BM}.
\]
Since \( BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{33}{AB} - \frac{5324}{AB^3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}.
\]
To find a solution, we can test possible values for \( AB \). By trial, we find that \( AB = 22 \) works:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{11}{22} = \frac{1}{2} \implies \theta = 30^\circ \implies 3\theta = 90^\circ.
\]
Then \( \sin 90^\circ = 1 \) and \( \cos 90^\circ = 0 \), which satisfies the equation. Therefore, \( BM = \sqrt{22^2 - 121} = \sqrt{302.5} = 11\sqrt{3} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

To find the 14th number in this list, we need to determine the number whose 27th root is the 14th number in the ordered list of the 27th roots of the numbers from 1 to 2187. This is equivalent to finding the number whose 27th power is the 14th number in the ordered list of the numbers from 1 to 2187.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is 0, which occurs when \(x = 0\). Since 0 is greater than \(-4\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us the roots \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
This simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]
Now, we use the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can rewrite \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12.\]
Expanding this, we have:
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We can rewrite the terms as:
\[s \cdot sp - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
Notice that:
\[x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[s^2 p - (sp - 12) = 12.\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[s^2 p - sp + 12 = 12.\]
Subtracting 12 from both sides, we get:
\[s^2 p - sp = 0.\]
Factoring out \(sp\), we have:
\[sp(s - 1) = 0.\]
Since \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\), and assuming \(s \neq 0\) and \(p \neq 0\), we must have \(s = 1\). Substituting \(s = 1\) into the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:

\[-8 = 1 - 3p.\]
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students who can take a bus to school in the 9th grade}}{\text{Number of students who can take a bus to school in the 11th grade}} \right) \times 100 \]
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{123.3}{61.8} \right) \times 100 \approx 200\% \]

Therefore, the number of students who can take a bus to school in the 9th grade is \(\boxed{135\%}\) of the number of students who can take a bus to school in the 11th grade.","[135*(1/100), '135\\%']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which is always non-negative. The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\), which changes sign at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or when the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator is an absolute value, it is always non-negative, and it is zero only at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality can only be satisfied when the denominator is negative.

The denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\). So, we need to check if the numerator is non-zero in this interval. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is non-zero for \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x\) is in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), it does not include \(x = -9\), so the numerator is non-zero for \(0 < x < 36\) and \(x \neq 9\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36 \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq 9.
\]
In interval notation, this is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the area of the football field, we need to analyze the given information and the diagram. The diagram shows a rectangular field with a semicircle at each end. The total length of the field is 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the two straight sides and the diameters of the two semicircles.

Since the two semicircles together form a full circle, the diameter of the circle is equal to the length of the two straight sides of the rectangle. Let's denote the length of each straight side by \( L \) and the diameter of the circle by \( D \). Therefore, the total length of the field is given by:
\[ 2L + D = 400 \]

The radius of the circle is \( \frac{D}{2} \). The area of the circle is:
\[ \pi \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \frac{D^2}{4} \]

The area of the rectangle is:
\[ L \times D \]

The total area of the football field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the circle:
\[ \text{Total Area} = L \times D + \pi \frac{D^2}{4} \]

From the equation \( 2L + D = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - D}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the total area formula, we get:
\[ \text{Total Area} = \left( \frac{400 - D}{2} \right) D + \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = \frac{400D - D^2}{2} + \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = 200D - \frac{D^2}{2} + \pi \frac{D^2}{4} = 200D + \left( \pi \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{2} \right) D^2 = 200D + \left( \frac{\pi}{4} - \frac{2}{4} \right) D^2 = 200D + \left( \frac{\pi - 2}{4} \right) D^2 \]

To maximize the area, we need to find the value of \( D \) that maximizes this quadratic function. The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = \frac{\pi - 2}{4} \) and \( b = 200 \), so:
\[ D = -\frac{200}{2 \left( \frac{\pi - 2}{4} \right)} = -\frac{200}{\frac{\pi - 2}{2}} = -\frac{400}{\pi - 2} \]

However, since \( D \) must be a positive value, we need to check the practical constraints. Given the problem, the maximum area is achieved when the semicircles are as large as possible, which occurs when the straight sides are equal to the diameter of the circle. Therefore, \( D = 200 \) meters and \( L = 100 \) meters.

Substituting \( D = 200 \) meters into the area formula, we get:
\[ \text{Total Area} = 100 \times 200 + \pi \frac{200^2}{4} = 20000 + \pi \frac{40000}{4} = 20000 + 10000\pi \]

Thus, the area of the football field is:

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with a right angle at \(S\), and \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\), then the length of the adjacent side \(RS\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
RS = \sqrt{RT^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}
\]
Now, for \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, the sine of \(\angle T\) is:
\[
\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{k\sqrt{21}}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
Thus, the value of \(\sin T\) is:

"To find the distance from the origin to the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) that is farthest from the origin, we need to maximize the distance function. The distance \( D \) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To maximize \( D \), we can maximize \( D^2 \) instead, which is:

\[ D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the function becomes a quadratic function in terms of \( u \):

\[ f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2} \]

The maximum or minimum value of a quadratic function \( au^2 + bu + c \) occurs at \( u = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = -2 \), so:

\[ u = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \]

Since the coefficient of \( u^2 \) is positive, the quadratic function opens upwards, and the minimum value occurs at \( u = 2 \). However, we are looking for the maximum distance, so we need to check the behavior of the function as \( u \) approaches the boundaries of the domain. As \( u \) approaches infinity, \( f(u) \) also approaches infinity, but we need to find the maximum distance on the curve, which occurs at the point where the derivative of \( y \) with respect to \( x \) is zero.

The derivative of \( y \) is:

\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2x) = \sqrt{2}x \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[ \sqrt{2}x = 0 \implies x = 0 \]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) back into the equation of the curve:

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

The point on the curve that is farthest from the origin is \( \left(0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \). The distance from the origin to this point is:

\[ D = \sqrt{0^2 + \left(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{9 \cdot 2}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{4}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Thus, the distance is \( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \), which is in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) where \( a = 9 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 9 + 2 = 11 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{cases} \]

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us three solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Solving the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us:
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) do not satisfy \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this case.

Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ -x = 3 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. We can factor \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 \) as:
\[ -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) \]
Setting \( -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) = 0 \):
\[ x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = -3 \]
Since \( x^2 = -3 \) has no real solutions, the only real solution is \( x = 2 \). However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so there are no solutions in this case.

Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the fifth vertex of the pentagon \( ABCDE \) given the distances to the other four vertices \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) as 3, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. The distances are as follows:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)

We need to find the distance \( PE \).

First, let's place the points in a coordinate system for convenience. Assume \( A = (1, 0, 0) \), \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \), \( C = (0, 1, 0) \), and \( D = (0, -1, 0) \). Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \).

Using the distance formula, we can write the following equations:
1. \( PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3 \)
2. \( PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7 \)
3. \( PC = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8 \)
4. \( PD = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9 \)

We need to find \( PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} \).

First, let's solve the equations for \( x, y, \) and \( z \).

From the first equation:
\[ (x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x + 1 = 9 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x = 8 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \]

From the second equation:
\[ (x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \]
\[ x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x + 1 = 49 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x = 48 \quad \text{(Equation 2)} \]

Adding Equation 1 and Equation 2:
\[ (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2x) + (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2x) = 8 + 48 \]
\[ 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 56 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 28 \]

Now substitute \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 28 \) back into Equation 1:
\[ 28 - 2x = 8 \]
\[ 20 = 2x \]
\[ x = 10 \]

Now substitute \( x = 10 \) into \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 28 \):
\[ 10^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 28 \]
\[ 100 + y^2 + z^2 = 28 \]
\[ y^2 + z^2 = -72 \]

This result is not possible since \( y^2 + z^2 \) cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, let's use the fact that the distances are symmetric and the pentagon is regular. The distance \( PE \) can be found using the properties of a regular pentagon.

The distance from the center of a regular pentagon to a vertex is given by:
\[ R = \frac{a}{2 \sin(\pi/5)} = \frac{a}{2 \sin(36^\circ)} = \frac{a}{2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{4}} = \frac{2a}{\sqrt{5}-1} = \frac{a(\sqrt{5}+1)}{2} \]

The distance from the center to the fifth vertex is:
\[ R \sqrt{5} = \frac{a(\sqrt{5}+1)}{2} \sqrt{5} = \frac{a(5+\sqrt{5})}{2} \]

Given the distances to the other four vertices, we can find \( a \) and then \( R \sqrt{5} \).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the distances are symmetric and the pentagon is regular. The distance \( PE \) can be found using the properties of a regular pentagon.

The distance \( PE \) is:

(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0,
\]
\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2.
\]

Now, we use the identity for the sum of products of roots taken three at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let \(S = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(T = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(U = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Then:
\[
S + T + U = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1(-2 - \alpha_1) + \alpha_2(-2 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\alpha_1 - \alpha_1^2 - 2\alpha_2 - \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) - (\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) - 4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 4 + 2\alpha_3 + 2\alpha_4 - 4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 + 4 + 2\alpha_3 + 2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 + 4 + 2\alpha_3 + 2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2\alpha_1 - 2\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4 - 2(-2 - \alpha_3 - \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2) + \alpha","[2, '2(-2 -']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],True
"To determine the cost of one pen, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's denote the cost of one pen by \( p \) and the cost of one jumblo by \( j \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( 4p + j = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5p + j = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( j \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + j) - (4p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
p = 0.58

So, the cost of one pen is \( \boxed{0.58} \).

To verify, we can substitute \( p = 0.58 \) back into the first equation to find \( j \):

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) lies within the inscribed circle centered at \(O\) with radius \(r\). The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a rectangle with \(AB = k \cdot AD\), and \(O\) is the center of the rectangle.

First, let's find the area of the rectangle \(ABCD\). Let \(AD = a\). Then \(AB = ka\). The area \(A\) of the rectangle is:
\[
A = AB \cdot AD = ka \cdot a = ka^2.
\]

Next, we find the area of the inscribed circle. The radius \(r\) of the inscribed circle is half the length of the shorter side of the rectangle, which is \(AD = a\). Therefore, the radius \(r\) is:
\[
r = \frac{a}{2}.

The area \(A_{\text{circle}}\) of the circle is:

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle lies within the inscribed circle is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\ 
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4. 
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( 1.05 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \).
   - Since \( 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

1. Calculate the total amount of money in cents.
2. Convert the total amount from cents to dollars.
3. Determine the amount of money in dollars after conversion.

First, let's find the total amount of money in cents:
- Linnda: \( \$27.47 \) which is \( 2747 \) cents.
- Sherra: \( \$35.23 \) which is \( 3523 \) cents.
- June: \( \$37.37 \) which is \( 3737 \) cents.
- The other person: \( \$26.52 \) which is \( 2652 \) cents.

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[

\]

Next, we convert the total amount from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the total number of cents by 100:
\[
\frac{12659}{100} = 126.59 \text{ dollars}

   So, the scores in ascending order are:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. The numbers in the magic square are \( n-3, 3, n+1, n+2, 2n-9, 1, 2, n, n-1 \).

First, let's calculate the sum of all the numbers in the magic square:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 + 2 + n + (n-1) = 7n - 11
\]
Since there are 3 rows in the magic square, the sum of each row (which is the same as the sum of each column and each diagonal) is:
\[
\frac{7n - 11}{3}
\]

Now, let's consider the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
This must equal the sum of each row, so we have:
\[
2n + 1 = \frac{7n - 11}{3}
\]
To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 3:
\[
3(2n + 1) = 7n - 11
\]
\[
6n + 3 = 7n - 11
\]
Subtracting \( 6n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
3 = n - 11
\]
Adding 11 to both sides, we find:
\[
n = 14
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 14 \) back into the magic square:
\[
n-3 = 11, \quad 3 = 3, \quad n+1 = 15, \quad n+2 = 16, \quad 2n-9 = 19, \quad 1 = 1, \quad 2 = 2, \quad n = 14, \quad n-1 = 13
\]
The magic square becomes:
\[
\begin{array}{ccc}
11 & 3 & 15 \\
16 & 14 & 1 \\
2 & 1 & 13 \\
\end{array}
\]
We check the sum of each row, column, and diagonal:
- Sum of the first row: \( 11 + 3 + 15 = 29 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 16 + 14 + 1 = 31 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 1 + 13 = 16 \)
- Sum of the first column: \( 11 + 16 + 2 = 29 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 14 + 1 = 18 \)
- Sum of the third column: \( 15 + 1 + 13 = 29 \)
- Sum of the main diagonal: \( 11 + 14 + 13 = 38 \)
- Sum of the other diagonal: \( 15 + 14 + 2 = 31 \)

These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[

So the expression becomes:

\[

Given that the distance between any two points is at least 1 unit, we need to check if it is possible for the edge length of the tetrahedron to be less than 1 unit. The edge length of a regular tetrahedron with side length \(s\) is \(s\). Therefore, if the distance between any two points is at least 1 unit, the edge length \(s\) must be at least 1 unit.

To verify, let's consider the formula for the edge length of a regular tetrahedron in terms of the circumradius \(R\):
\[ s = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} R \]
For a regular tetrahedron, the circumradius \(R\) is the distance from the center of the tetrahedron to any of its vertices. If the distance between any two vertices is at least 1 unit, then the circumradius \(R\) must be at least \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\). Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt{\frac{8}{3}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{\frac{8}{9}} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \approx 0.9428 \]
Since \(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} < 1\), it is not possible for the edge length of the tetrahedron to be less than 1 unit if the distance between any two points is at least 1 unit.
