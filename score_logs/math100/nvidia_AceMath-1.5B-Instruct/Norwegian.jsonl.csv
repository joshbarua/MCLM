"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point on the y-axis directly above \(F\), and \(D\) is a point in the first quadrant. The coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(F\) are \((0, 0)\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

The coordinates of \(D\) are \((x, 7)\) where \(x = \sqrt{51}\). We need to find the length of \(DE\), which is the horizontal distance from \(D\) to \(E\). This distance is simply the x-coordinate of \(D\), which is \(\sqrt{51}\).

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \).
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i \theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i^2 = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{6}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i \cdot (-1) = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i = -2 + i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   This is done by adding \( c \) to \( z'' \).
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (-2 + i) + (2 - 3i) = 0 - 2i = -2i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. The square root of \(11^2\) is 11, and the square root of 2 is \(\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, we have:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as one ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways, which is \(3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units around the table by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2) = (7k + 2 + 2) = 7k + 4
\]
\[
(n + 4) = (7k + 2 + 4) = 7k + 6
\]
\[
(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 6) = 7k + 8
\]

Now, we need to find the remainders of these expressions when divided by 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 becomes:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Now, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must rotate to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated by certain angles and still look the same.

The full rotation around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since a regular pentagon has 5 sides, it can be divided into 5 equal parts. Therefore, the smallest angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that if the pentagon is rotated by 72 degrees, it will look exactly the same as it did before, and it will have returned to its original position.

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must rotate to return to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallellogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the sum \(x + y\) is calculated correctly under the given condition.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct coordinates should be re-evaluated under the correct condition \(x > 7\). The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is not \((6, -1)\) but another point that satisfies the condition \(x > 7\).

Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the sum \(x + y\) is calculated correctly under the given condition.

The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is \((x, y)\) such that the sum \(x + y\) is calculated correctly under the given condition \(x > 7\).

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and then sum them up, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)
Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

for \( k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), we exclude \( k = 0 \). Therefore, the possible values of \( z \) are:

\[ z = e^{2\pi i / 5}, e^{4\pi i / 5}, e^{6\pi i / 5}, e^{8\pi i / 5} \]

We need to compute the expression:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \]

First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \]

The fifth roots of unity satisfy the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[ (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \]

This implies:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1 \]

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalent of \(18_9\) from the base \(10\) equivalent of \(58_9\):
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can cancel one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks correspond to the weight of one squig, given the relationships provided in the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the relationships:**
   - Two treeks are like four squigs.
   - Two treeks are like one goolee.
   - One squig is like one goolee.

2. **Express these relationships mathematically:**
   - Let \( T \) be the weight of one treek.
   - Let \( S \) be the weight of one squig.
   - Let \( G \) be the weight of one goolee.

   From the relationships, we can write:
   \[
   2T = 4S
   \]
   \[
   2T = G
   \]
   \[
   S = G
   \]

3. **Substitute the weight of one squig with the weight of one goolee:**
   Since \( S = G \), we can substitute \( G \) for \( S \) in the first equation:
   \[
   2T = 4G
   \]

4. **Solve for \( T \):**
   To find the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one goolee, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   T = 2G
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The weight of one treek is equal to the weight of two gooles. Since one squig is like one goolee, the weight of one squig is \( G \). Therefore, the weight of one treek is \( 2G \), which is the same as the weight of two squigs.

Thus, the number of treeks that correspond to the weight of one squig is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the given information and set up equations accordingly.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( r \) be the radius of the tank in meters.
   - Let \( h \) be the height of the water in the tank in meters.

2. **Volume of Water in the Tank:**
   The volume \( V \) of water in the tank is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]

3. **Rate of Change of Volume:**
   The tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per minute. Therefore, the rate of change of volume \( \frac{dV}{dt} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
   \]

4. **Rate of Change of Height:**
   The height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per minute. Therefore, the rate of change of height \( \frac{dh}{dt} \) is:
   \[
   \frac{dh}{dt} = 4

5. **Relate Volume and Height:**
   Differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}

6. **Substitute the Known Rates:**

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) piecewise and ensure that it does not have any horizontal tangents or points where it changes direction in a way that allows a horizontal line to intersect the graph more than once.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the quadratic piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). The derivative of this piece is:
\[ f'(x) = 2ax. \]
For \(x \geq a\), the derivative \(f'(x) = 2ax\) is non-negative if \(a \geq 0\). If \(a < 0\), the derivative is non-positive, which means the function is decreasing. However, we need to ensure that the function does not have any horizontal tangents or points where it changes direction in a way that allows a horizontal line to intersect the graph more than once.

Next, let's consider the linear piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). The derivative of this piece is:
\[ f'(x) = a. \]
For \(x < a\), the derivative \(f'(x) = a\) is constant. If \(a = 0\), the function is constant and does not change direction. If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing. If \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing.

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once, we need to ensure that the quadratic piece does not have any horizontal tangents and that the linear piece does not change direction in a way that allows a horizontal line to intersect the graph more than once. The critical point to consider is the point where the two pieces meet, which is at \(x = a\).

At \(x = a\), the value of the function is:
\[ f(a) = a^2 \quad \text{(from the quadratic piece)} \]
and
\[ f(a) = a^2 + 2a \quad \text{(from the linear piece)}. \]
For the function to be continuous and ensure that it does not have any horizontal tangents, we need:
\[ a^2 = a^2 + 2a. \]
Subtracting \(a^2\) from both sides, we get:
\[ 0 = 2a. \]
Thus, \(a = 0\).

However, we need to ensure that the function does not have any horizontal tangents or points where it changes direction in a way that allows a horizontal line to intersect the graph more than once. The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this condition is when the quadratic piece is decreasing and the linear piece is increasing, which means \(a < 0\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We are given that \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we have:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(a) \neq a\). This means that \(a\) is a fixed point of \(f(f(x))\) but not a fixed point of \(f(x)\). A fixed point of \(f(x)\) satisfies:

\[ f(a) = a, \]
\[ \lambda a(1 - a) = a. \]

If \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):

\[ \lambda (1 - a) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda - \lambda a = 1, \]
\[ \lambda a = \lambda - 1, \]
\[ a = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(a\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:

\[ 0 \leq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1. \]

The right inequality is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\). The left inequality gives:

\[ 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \geq 0, \]
\[ \frac{1}{\lambda} \leq 1, \]
\[ \lambda \geq 1. \]

So, \(a = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\) if \(\lambda \geq 1\). We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(f(a) \neq a\) but \(f(f(a)) = a\). This means that \(a = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is not a fixed point of \(f(x)\), so:

\[ f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}. \]

Let's compute \(f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\):

\[ f\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\right) = \lambda \left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

We need:

\[ \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}, \]
\[ \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

This inequality is never true, so we need to consider the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(f(f(a)) = a\) but \(a\) is not a fixed point of \(f(x)\). This means that \(a\) must be a root of the equation:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x \]
\[ \text{but } x \neq 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}. \]

We already know that \(x = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(f(x))\) but not of \(f(x)\) if \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[

The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and \(\theta\) is positive is:

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters L, I, P, S are all 1.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its partial derivatives.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so \( f(x, y) = y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \). Similarly, if either \( y = 1 \) or \( y = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \), so \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \). Therefore, the maximum value on the boundary is 0.

Next, we consider the interior of the region \( -1 < x, y < 1 \). To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
From the first equation, we can solve for \( y^2 \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = x^2 y^2 (1 - x^2).
\]
From the second equation, we can solve for \( x^2 \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 = x^2 y^2 (1 - y^2).
\]
By symmetry, we can assume \( x = y \). Substituting \( y = x \) into the equation, we get:
\[
1 - x^2 - x^2 = x^2 x^2 (1 - x^2) \implies 1 - 2x^2 = x^4 (1 - x^2).
\]
Let \( z = x^2 \). Then the equation becomes:
\[
1 - 2z = z^2 (1 - z) \implies 1 - 2z = z^2 - z^3 \implies z^3 - z^2 - 2z + 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1 \). Testing \( z = 1 \):
\[
1^3 - 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 + 1 = 1 - 1 - 2 + 1 = -1 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \( z = -1 \):
\[
(-1)^3 - (-1)^2 - 2 \cdot (-1) + 1 = -1 - 1 + 2 + 1 = 1 \neq 0.
\]
Since neither \( z = 1 \) nor \( z = -1 \) is a root, we need to find the roots numerically or use other methods. However, we can use symmetry and the fact that the function is maximized at \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) or \( x = y = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting \( x = y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) into the function, we get:
\[
f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1.

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, since \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) is a real number. This implies that \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \).

First, we need to find the angle \( \theta \) such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Using the identity \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2 \cos \theta \), we have:
\[
2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
Solving for \( \cos \theta \), we get:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]
The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:
\[
z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1.
\]
Thus,
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2.
\]
If \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:
\[
z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1.
\]
Thus,
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2.

In both cases, we get the same result. Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \), \( MN \) is the midline of triangle \( ABC \) with respect to the centroid. This means that \( MN \) is half the length of \( BC \).

Next, we consider the areas of the triangles formed by the centroid and the sides of the original triangle. The centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of the triangles \( AGB \), \( BGC \), and \( CGA \) is one-third of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid, the triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{1}{2} \). The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

"To determine how many positive integer factors are common to both 100 and 150, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 and then count the number of positive integer factors of this GCD.

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) for which \( 2^{24} = k^n \).

First, note that \( 2^{24} = (2^a)^b \) if and only if \( 24 = ab \) for some integers \( a \) and \( b \). Here, \( a \) is the exponent of 2 in the base, and \( b \) is the exponent of the base in the exponentiation. Therefore, \( n = b \) and \( k = 2^a \).

We need to find all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \( ab = 24 \). The factor pairs of 24 are:
\[
(1, 24), (2, 12), (3, 8), (4, 6), (6, 4), (8, 3), (12, 2), (24, 1)
\]

From these pairs, the possible values for \( b \) (which is \( n \)) are:
\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24

"To determine how many five-year-olds Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( f \) be the number of five-year-olds.
- Let \( t \) be the number of three-year-olds.

According to the problem, the total number of children is 10, so we can write the equation:
\[ f + t = 10 \]

We also know that the total value of the children's ages is 75 cents. Since each five-year-old is worth 5 cents and each three-year-old is worth 3 cents, we can write another equation:
\[ 5f + 3t = 75 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( f + t = 10 \)
2. \( 5f + 3t = 75 \)

We can solve this system step by step. First, solve the first equation for \( t \):
\[ t = 10 - f \]

Next, substitute this expression for \( t \) into the second equation:
\[ 5f + 3(10 - f) = 75 \]

Now, distribute the 3:
\[ 5f + 30 - 3f = 75 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2f + 30 = 75 \]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2f = 45 \]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ f = \frac{45}{2} = 22.5 \]

Since the number of children must be a whole number, it seems there might be a mistake in the problem setup or interpretation. However, based on the given problem, the correct interpretation should be that the number of five-year-olds is 22.5, which is not possible in a real-world scenario.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse select is a prime number, we first identify the first six prime numbers. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we list all possible sums of these two numbers. Since Paul and Jesse each select one of these six numbers, there are \(6 \times 6 = 36\) possible outcomes. We will calculate each sum and check if it is a prime number.

The possible sums are:
\[
\begin{array}{c|cccccc}

Now, we identify which of these sums are prime numbers. The prime numbers in the list are 5, 7, 13, and 19. From the table, we see that the sums that are prime are:
- 5 (from 2 + 3)
- 7 (from 2 + 5 and 3 + 4)
- 13 (from 2 + 11 and 3 + 10 and 5 + 8 and 7 + 6)
- 19 (from 6 + 13 and 7 + 12 and 11 + 8)

However, since 19 is not in the list of possible sums, we only consider the sums 5, 7, and 13. The number of ways to get these sums are:
- 5: 1 way (2 + 3)
- 7: 2 ways (2 + 5 and 3 + 4)
- 13: 4 ways (2 + 11, 3 + 10, 5 + 8, and 7 + 6)

Adding these, we get \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\) ways to get a prime sum.

   - The second triangle has a base of 1 unit and a height of 4 units. Using the same formula, the area of the second triangle is:
     \[
     \text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2

2. **Identify the area of the rectangle:**
   - The rectangle has a length of 3 units and a width of 4 units. The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include all the prime factors of 450 in its factorization. This means the number must be even (since it must include the factor 2), and it must end in 00 (since it must include the factor \(5^2 = 25\) and be even, the last two digits must be 00).

Given that the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the only way to satisfy these conditions is to have the number be 11100. Let's verify this:

1. Check if 11100 is even: Yes, it ends in 0, so it is even.
2. Check if 11100 is divisible by 3: The sum of the digits of 11100 is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.
3. Check if 11100 is divisible by 5: Yes, it ends in 0, so it is divisible by 5.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote these roots by \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( -a \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49.
\]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \), which is equivalent to \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( f(r_i) = 0 \), then \( f((r_i + 5) - 5) = f(r_i) = 0 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34.

"To determine how many sides a convex polygon would have if the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles except one:**
   If the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the sum of all the interior angles is \(1070^\circ + x\), where \(x\) is the measure of the missing interior angle.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   For a convex polygon, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\), so \(x < 180^\circ\).

4. **Find the range for \(n\):**
   To find the possible values of \(n\), we need to ensure that \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\) is slightly more than \(1070^\circ\) but less than \(1250^\circ\) (since \(1070^\circ + 180^\circ = 1250^\circ\)).

   First, solve the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

   Divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

Therefore, the polygon has \(\boxed{8}\) sides.","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:

\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ (-5)^2 = 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

and

\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are valid solutions. However, the problem asks for the unique odd integer, and both are odd, so we can choose either. Conventionally, we might choose the smaller one, but since the problem does not specify, we can choose either. Here, we will choose the smaller one:

\[ t = 4 \]

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the surface area of the cube using the side length.

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:

where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Since we have determined that \( s = 1 \) foot, we substitute this value into the formula:
\[ A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\) square feet.","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Applying the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\), so \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta}\).

However, we can simplify the expression \(\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) directly. We know that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\), so:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x) + \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

Thus, the equation becomes:

We know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\), so the equation simplifies to:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can use \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) as points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = 31 \mathbf{i} - 6 \mathbf{j} + 58 \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(D\) between the two lines is:

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these, we can substitute the values into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"To find the average price per frimerke for Juan's 70s frimerkeamling, we need to calculate the total number of frimerker and the total cost of these frimerker, and then divide the total cost by the total number of frimerker.

First, let's determine the number of frimerker from each country in the 70s:
- Brazil: 12 frimerker
- Frankrike: 12 frimerker
- Peru: 6 frimerker
- Spain: 10 frimerker

Next, we calculate the total number of frimerker:
\[ 12 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 40 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost of the frimerker from each country:
- Brazil: \( 12 \text{ frimerker} \times 12 \text{ cent per frimerke} = 144 \text{ cents} \)
- Frankrike: \( 12 \text{ frimerker} \times 8 \text{ cent per frimerke} = 96 \text{ cents} \)
- Peru: \( 6 \text{ frimerker} \times 4 \text{ cent per frimerke} = 24 \text{ cents} \)
- Spain: \( 10 \text{ frimerker} \times 6 \text{ cent per frimerke} = 60 \text{ cents} \)

Next, we calculate the total cost of all the frimerker:
\[ 144 + 96 + 24 + 60 = 324 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we find the average price per frimerke by dividing the total cost by the total number of frimerker:
\[ \text{Average price per frimerke} = \frac{324 \text{ cents}}{40 \text{ frimerker}} = 8.1 \text{ cents per frimerke} \]

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the angles in the trapezoid. Let \(\angle BAD = 2\theta\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle CAD = \theta\) and \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\) imply that \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ - \theta\).

Now, let's consider the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\). The area of a trapezoid is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
\]
where \(h\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(h = CD\).

Next, let's consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of a triangle is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{CD}{BD}
\]
However, we don't need this ratio directly to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

We know that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC \sin \theta
\]
Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\sin \theta = \frac{CD}{AC}\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC \times \frac{CD}{AC} = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD + \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times (BC + AD)
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times CD \times (BC + AD) = 42 \implies CD \times (BC + AD) = 84
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\):

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Label the Points**: Assume without loss of generality that point \(A\) is fixed. This is because the circle is symmetric, and the probability of intersection will be the same regardless of which point is chosen as the starting point.

2. **Arrange the Points**: After fixing point \(A\), the remaining points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be arranged in any order around the circle. There are \(3!\) (6) possible permutations of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

3. **Identify Intersection Conditions**: For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points is separated by the other pair when moving around the circle. Specifically, if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle as \(A, P, Q, R, B, C, D\) (where \(P, Q, R\) are the other points), then \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the order is \(A, P, Q, R, B, C, D\) or \(A, R, Q, P, B, C, D\) or \(A, Q, P, R, B, C, D\) or \(A, Q, R, P, B, C, D\) or \(A, R, P, Q, B, C, D\) or \(A, R, Q, P, B, C, D\). This means that the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle.

4. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of the 6 possible permutations of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), only 3 will result in the segments intersecting. These are the permutations where the points are in an alternating pattern. For example, if \(B\) is between \(A\) and \(C\), then \(D\) must be between \(C\) and \(A\), and so on.

5. **Calculate the Probability**: Since there are 6 possible permutations of points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) and only 3 of them result in the segments intersecting, the probability is:

   \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the given configuration of two circles with radii 1 and 2, respectively, and a common center \(D\).

First, let's denote the points of intersection of the two circles as \(A\) and \(C\). The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so \(DA = 1\). The radius of the larger circle is 2, so \(DC = 2\). The distance between the centers \(D\) and \(A\) is 1, and the distance between the centers \(D\) and \(C\) is 2.

The total area of the overlapping region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
So, the area of the overlapping region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The overlapping region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. The area of the segment from the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle \(DAB\), and the area of the segment from the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle \(DAC\).

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:

\]
The area of the triangle \(DAB\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{2}
\]
So, the area of the segment from the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\sin \theta}{2} = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2}
\]

The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle \(DAC\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
So, the area of the segment from the larger circle is:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta = 2(\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

The total area of the overlapping region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + 2(\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + \frac{4(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2}
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so:
\[
\frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

Dividing both sides by 5:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3}

Multiplying both sides by 2:

First, let's calculate the volume of one sylindrisk beger. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the sylindrisk beger, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{beger}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - 2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin (A + B) \sin (A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2A) - \cos (2B)].
\]
Substituting \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\), we get:
\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) - \cos (2 \arcsin 0.5)].
\]
Next, we use the double-angle identity for cosine:
\[
\cos (2 \arcsin x) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 (\arcsin x) = 1 - 2x^2.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) = 1 - 2 (0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68,
\]
\[
\cos (2 \arcsin 0.5) = 1 - 2 (0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:
\[

Since \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\), we can substitute 120 for \(x(x+1)(x+2)\):
\[\frac{120}{x+1} = 24.\]

To find \(x+1\), we solve the equation:
\[120 = 24(x+1).\]

Dividing both sides by 24, we get:
\[x+1 = 5.\]

Therefore, \(x = 4\). The three consecutive integers are \(x = 4\), \(x+1 = 5\), and \(x+2 = 6\).

The largest of these three integers is 6. Thus, the answer is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]

5. This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

6. Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[

Therefore, the original expression is:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the circumradius \( R \) of \( \triangle ABC \). We also know that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BAC = \angle MAB = \angle MAC = \frac{\theta}{2} \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle AMB \), we have:
\[
\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{BM}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB}.
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), so \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). In \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\sin \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{BM}{BD} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{DM}{BD} = \frac{1}{BD}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BD = \frac{1}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity for cosine, we have:
\[
\cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = 4 \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3 \cos \frac{\theta}{2}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3 \cos \frac{\theta}{2}}.
\]

Since \( BM = AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{11 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \), we substitute \( BD \) and \( BM \) into the equation:
\[
\sin \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{\frac{11 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}}{\frac{1}{4 \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3 \cos \frac{\theta}{2}}} = 11 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} (4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3).
\]
Using the triple-angle identity for sine, we have:
\[
\sin \frac{3\theta}{2} = 3 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( \sin \frac{3\theta}{2} \), we get:
\[
3 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} = 11 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} (4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - 3).
\]
Since \( \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 \), we substitute \( \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \):
\[
3 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} = 11 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} (4 (1 - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}) - 3) = 11 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} (1 - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}).
\]
Dividing both sides by \( \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \) (assuming \( \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \neq 0 \)), we get:
\[
3 - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 11 (1 - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}).
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
3 - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 11 - 44 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \implies 40 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 8 \implies \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1}{5} \implies \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{5}} = \sqrt{\frac{4}{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{11}{\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{2}.

"To find the median of the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers that equals \(3^7\), we first need to determine the sum of these integers and then identify the middle number in the sequence.

The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive positive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:
\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]
For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:
\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]
We know that this sum equals \(3^7\):
\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

Thus, \(a = 81 - 13 = 68\). The 27 consecutive integers are:
\[
68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94

The median of a sequence of 27 numbers is the 14th number in the ordered list. To find the 14th number, we note that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence with the first term \(a = 68\) and the common difference \(d = 1\). The \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 4)\). Since \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\) and \(x^2 + 4 > 0\) for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^2(x^2 + 4)\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y - 3)(y + 7)\). Therefore, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be written as:
\[(y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.\]
This inequality holds when \(y\) is between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\), i.e., \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have \(0 \leq y < 3\). Therefore, \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\), which means:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor this expression as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can rewrite \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12,\]
which expands to
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We know that \(xy + yz + zx = p\) and \(xyz = 4\), so the equation becomes
\[sp - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We can further factor \(x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y\) as
\[x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[sp - (sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = 12,\]
which is true but does not provide new information.

Now we return to the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\). We need to find a consistent solution for \(s\) and \(p\). Let's test some possible values for \(s\). If we try \(s = 2\), we get
\[-8 = 2(2^2 - 3p),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = 2(4 - 3p),\]
or
\[-8 = 8 - 6p,\]
or
\[-16 = -6p,\]
or
\[p = \frac{8}{3}.\]

We need to verify that \(s = 2\) and \(p = \frac{8}{3}\) satisfy the original equations. If \(s = 2\) and \(p = \frac{8}{3}\), then
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = 4 - \frac{16}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{16}{3} = -\frac{4}{3},\]
which is not possible since \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) must be non-negative. Therefore, \(s = 2\) is not a valid solution.

Let's try \(s = 4\):
\[-8 = 4(4^2 - 3p),\]

\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p = 16 - 2 \cdot 6 = 16 - 12 = 4,\]
which is possible. We also need to check if the original equations are satisfied. The equations are consistent with \(s = 4\) and \(p = 6\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), and the expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. From the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\), we get the critical points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). From the denominator \(x(x-36)\), we get the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-\infty, -9)\).

2. For the interval \((-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-9, 0)\).

3. For the interval \((0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} = -\frac{16}{7} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((0, 9)\).

4. For the interval \((9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} = -\frac{19}{260} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((9, 36)\).

5. For the interval \((36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves. The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and it is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), the points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the inequality holds:

"To find the largest possible area of the rectangular felt, we need to consider the dimensions of the rectangle and the semicircles at the ends. The total length of the banen is the sum of the length of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the two semicircles together form a full circle, the total length of the banen is the length of the rectangle plus the circumference of the circle.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width of the rectangle by \( W \). The radius of the semicircles is \( \frac{W}{2} \), so the circumference of the circle is \( 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W \).

The total length of the banen is given by:
\[ L + \pi W = 400 \]

We want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \cdot W \]

From the equation \( L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ L = 400 - \pi W \]

Substituting this into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = (400 - \pi W) W = 400W - \pi W^2 \]

This is a quadratic function in terms of \( W \), and it opens downwards (since the coefficient of \( W^2 \) is negative). The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -\pi \) and \( b = 400 \), so the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area is:
\[ W = -\frac{400}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{400}{2\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = 400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right) = 400 - 200 = 200 \]

Now, we can find the maximum area \( A \):
\[ A = L \cdot W = 200 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the felt is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

This means that if we let \(RS = 2k\), then \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\). To find the length of the other leg \(ST\), we use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
(5k)^2 = (2k)^2 + ST^2
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
25k^2 = 4k^2 + ST^2
\]

Subtracting \(4k^2\) from both sides, we get:

\[
21k^2 = ST^2
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}k
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. In this triangle, the opposite side to angle \(T\) is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2k}{5k} = \frac{2}{5}

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) as:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]
Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To find the minimum value of \(D\), we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(D\) is:
\[

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer larger than 1, we find \(a + b\):

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the distances from \( P \) to the five given vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that the distance between each pair is the same. Let's denote the distances from \( P \) to the vertices as \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, \) and \( d_6 \), where \( d_6 \) is the distance we need to find.

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a property of regular polyhedra. Therefore, we can write:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = \text{constant}

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:

Let the constant sum of the squares of the distances be \( C \). Then:
\[
C = 324 + d_6^2

Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since the force applied to both the softball and the baseball is the same, we can write:

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) - \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4.

"To determine the cost of one blyant, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( b \) be the cost of one blyant in dollars.
- Let \( j \) be the cost of one jumbo viskeler in dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. One blyant and one jumbo viskeler cost \$1.24:
   \[
   b + j = 1.24
   \]

2. Five blyants and one jumbo viskeler cost \$1.82:
   \[

We can eliminate \( j \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[

\]
\[

Since the cost of one blyant is in dollars, we convert it to cents by multiplying by 100:

"To find the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\). Since 137 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 500 other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we perform the division of 137 by 500:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = 0.274

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\), so \(a = kb\) since \(AB/AD = k\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\).

The region where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four circles centered at \(O\) with radii equal to the distances from \(O\) to each vertex. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore, the region of interest is the circle centered at \(O\) with radius \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

The area of this circle is:
\[
\pi \left(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\right)^2 = \pi (a^2 + b^2)
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
2a \cdot 2b = 4ab

Since \(a = kb\), the area of the rectangle can be rewritten as:
\[
4ab = 4(kb)b = 4kb^2

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{4ab} = \frac{\pi (k^2b^2 + b^2)}{4kb^2} = \frac{\pi b^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4kb^2} = \frac{\pi (k^2 + 1)}{4k}

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have left after vowing to return at least 50% of their money to the bank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they have initially.
2. Determine how much money they need to return to the bank (50% of the total).
3. Calculate the amount of money they have left after returning 50% of their money.

First, let's find the total amount of money they have initially:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Linda's amount} + \text{Sherry's amount} + \text{June's amount} + \text{Connie's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have initially is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine how much money they need to return to the bank, which is 50% of the total amount:
\[
\text{Amount to return} = 0.5 \times \text{Total amount}
\]
\[
\text{Amount to return} = 0.5 \times 126.59 = 63.295
\]

Since we are dealing with money, we round \$63.295 to the nearest cent, which is \$63.30. Therefore, they need to return \$63.30 to the bank.

Now, we calculate the amount of money they have left after returning \$63.30:
\[
\text{Amount left} = \text{Total amount} - \text{Amount to return}
\]
\[
\text{Amount left} = 126.59 - 63.30 = 63.29

   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600

2. Determine the total score for the students who scored 90. There are 8 students who scored 90, so the total score for these students is:

"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given \( 4 \times 4 \) matrix is a magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3
\]

This sum must be equal to the sum of the numbers in any other row, column, or diagonal. Let's check the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 + n = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sums must be equal, we set the two sums equal to each other:

\[
3n + 3 = 3n - 6
\]

This equation is clearly a contradiction, which suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem statement or the interpretation of the matrix. However, let's proceed by checking the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[

\]

And the sum of the numbers in the fourth row:

\[
(n-1) + (n-3) + (n-1) + (n-3) = 4n - 8

Since the sums must be equal, we set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the fourth row:

"To determine how many feet less Martha travels than Jim, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally across the rectangular mark. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the mark).

The length of the mark is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the distance Jim travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Jim travels} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes along the length and the width of the mark. Therefore, the distance Martha travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This means that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:

- \( AC = d_{AC} \)
- \( AD = d_{AD} \)
- \( BC = d_{BC} \)
- \( BD = d_{BD} \)
- \( CD = d_{CD} \)

We need to find the shortest path that visits all four points exactly once. This is a classic problem known as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) for four points. The TSP for four points can be solved by checking all possible permutations of the points and calculating the total distance for each permutation.

There are \( 4! = 24 \) permutations of the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \). However, since the distance from a point to itself is zero, we only need to consider permutations where each point appears exactly once. The number of distinct permutations of four points is \( 4! = 24 \), but since the order of visiting the points does not matter, we only need to consider the unique distances.

The shortest distance will be the minimum of the total distances for all permutations. However, without specific values for the distances, we cannot determine the exact shortest distance. But we can express the answer in terms of the distances between the points.

The shortest distance that allows a journey starting at any point and visiting the other three points exactly once is the minimum of the total distances for all permutations of the points. Therefore, the answer is:
