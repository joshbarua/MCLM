"To find the length of \( DE \) given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( DF = 7 \), we can use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \( \sin D = \frac{DF}{DE} \).

Given:
\[ \sin D = 0.7 \]
\[ DF = 7 \]

We need to find \( DE \). Using the definition of sine, we have:
\[ \sin D = \frac{DF}{DE} \]
\[ 0.7 = \frac{7}{DE} \]

To solve for \( DE \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( DE \):
\[ 0.7 \cdot DE = 7 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[ DE = \frac{7}{0.7} \]

To simplify \( \frac{7}{0.7} \), we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 10:
\[ DE = \frac{7 \cdot 10}{0.7 \cdot 10} = \frac{70}{7} = 10 \]

Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise, we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

6. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of different ways to arrange 3 boys (Pierre, Rose, and Tom) around a circular table, we need to consider the properties of circular permutations. In a circular arrangement, one position is fixed to account for rotational symmetry.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Fix one boy's position**: By fixing one boy's position, we convert the circular arrangement into a linear arrangement. This is because rotating the entire arrangement by one position will result in an identical arrangement.

2. **Arrange the remaining boys**: After fixing one boy's position, we need to arrange the remaining 2 boys in the remaining 2 positions. The number of ways to arrange 2 boys in 2 positions is given by the factorial of 2, which is \(2!\).

3. **Calculate the number of arrangements**: The factorial of 2 is calculated as follows:
   \[

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) \) is divided by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 2 + 7k \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, we have:
\[
n + 2 = 2 + 7k + 2 = 4 + 7k \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 = 2 + 7k + 4 = 6 + 7k \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 = 2 + 7k + 6 = 8 + 7k \equiv 1 + 7k \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, we substitute these congruences back into the original expression:
\[
(n+2)(n+4)(n+6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

We now find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,
\]
so
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the given information and apply it step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The pentagon is a regular pentagon.
   - The pentagon is inscribed in a circle.
   - The pentagon is symmetric about its center.

2. **Understand the problem:**
   - We need to find the number of sides of the pentagon that are in the same direction as the radius of the circle.

3. **Analyze the properties of a regular pentagon inscribed in a circle:**
   - A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.
   - When a regular pentagon is inscribed in a circle, each side of the pentagon subtends a central angle of \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

4. **Determine the direction of the sides relative to the radius:**
   - The radius of the circle is a line segment from the center of the circle to a vertex of the pentagon.
   - Each side of the pentagon is at an angle of \( 72^\circ \) to the adjacent sides.
   - Therefore, each side of the pentagon is in the same direction as the radius of the circle if it is parallel to the radius.

5. **Count the number of sides in the same direction as the radius:**
   - In a regular pentagon, there are no sides that are parallel to the radius of the circle.
   - However, the problem states that the pentagon is symmetric about its center and that the pentagon is inscribed in a circle. This implies that the pentagon is rotating around its center, and at some point, one side will be in the same direction as the radius.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the pentagon is symmetric and inscribed, there is exactly one side of the pentagon that is in the same direction as the radius of the circle at any given moment.

Therefore, the number of sides of the pentagon that are in the same direction as the radius of the circle is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) in the given parallelogram, we first need to determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram. The vertices of the parallelogram are given as \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of one diagonal is equal to the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, this midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

By equating the coordinates, we get two equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied by \(x = 6\), there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. However, based on the given problem and the logical steps, the correct interpretation should be that the problem constraints are not consistent with the geometric properties of a parallelogram.

Given the problem constraints and the logical steps, the correct value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\] (if the problem constraints are re-evaluated or the vertices are rechecked). However, based on the given problem, the correct interpretation should be that the problem constraints are not consistent with the geometric properties of a parallelogram. Therefore, the correct answer is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",17,"[17, '17']",False

"To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function.

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0,\]
\[x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator \(P(x) = 2x\) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \(Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14\) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). So, \(c = 0\).

Now, we need to find the sum \(a + b + c\):
\[a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.\]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b + c\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break down the problem into smaller, manageable steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):

So, \(99^2 = 9801\).

Next, we add 99 to \(9801\):
\[
9801 + 99 = 9900

Finally, we add 1 to 9900:
\[

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.

3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:

\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9

To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[

\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

- Weight of the third tree: \( T_3 \)
- Weight of the goose: \( G \)

According to the problem, the total weight of the three trees and the one goose is equal to the weight of one tree and one goose. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + G = T_1 + T_2 + G \]

By subtracting \( T_1 + T_2 + G \) from both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ T_3 = 0 \]

This means the weight of the third tree is zero. Now, we need to find out how much the weight of the goose is in terms of the weight of one tree. From the equation \( T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + G = T_1 + T_2 + G \), we can see that the weight of the goose is equal to the weight of one tree. Therefore, the weight of the goose is \( T_1 \).

Now, we need to find out how much the weight of the goose is in terms of the total weight of the three trees and the one goose. Since the weight of the goose is \( T_1 \), the total weight of the three trees and the one goose is:
\[ T_1 + T_2 + T_3 + T_1 = T_1 + T_2 + 0 + T_1 = 2T_1 + T_2 \]

The weight of one tree is \( T_1 \), so the weight of the goose is \( T_1 \). Therefore, the weight of the goose is:

= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know from the problem that the volume of the tank is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters and the height is 4 meters. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To isolate \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the cylindrical tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each line segment at most once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin if \(a > 0\), or downwards if \(a < 0\).

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each line segment at most once, the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must not intersect the line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). This means that the minimum value of the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must be greater than the maximum value of the line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\).

The minimum value of the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

The maximum value of the line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

For the graph to intersect each line segment at most once, we need:
\[ a^3 > a^2 + 2a. \]

Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a > 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) > 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) > 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we determine the critical points by setting each factor equal to zero:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

These critical points divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
\[ (-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 < 0. \]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((- \infty, -1)\).

2. For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
\[ (-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0. \]
So, the inequality holds in \((-1, 0)\).

3. For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
\[ (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 < 0. \]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((0, 2)\).

4. For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
\[ (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0. \]
So, the inequality holds in \((2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) > 0\) holds for \(a \in (-1, 0) \cup (2, \infty)\). Since \(a\) is a positive number, the maximum value of \(a\) is:
\[ \boxed{2}. \]","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the given equation represents a circle with a radius of 1, we start with the equation:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

First, we need to rewrite this equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is:

\[ (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2 \]

where \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

### Step 1: Complete the square for the \( x \)-terms
The \( x \)-terms in the equation are \( x^2 - 10x \). To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), square it, and add and subtract this value inside the equation.

\[ \left( \frac{-10}{2} \right)^2 = 25 \]

So, we rewrite \( x^2 - 10x \) as:

\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

### Step 2: Complete the square for the \( y \)-terms
The \( y \)-terms in the equation are \( y^2 + 6y \). To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), square it, and add and subtract this value inside the equation.

\[ \left( \frac{6}{2} \right)^2 = 9 \]

So, we rewrite \( y^2 + 6y \) as:

\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

### Step 3: Substitute the completed squares back into the original equation
Now, substitute the completed squares into the original equation:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constants on the left side:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

### Step 4: Isolate the completed squares
Add 34 to both sides of the equation to isolate the completed squares:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

### Step 5: Compare with the standard form
The equation \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

### Step 6: Set the radius equal to 1
We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\).

### Step 7: Solve for \( c \)
Square both sides of the equation to solve for \( c \):

\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

Subtract 34 from both sides:

\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]

\[ -c = -33 \]

Multiply both sides by -1:

\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

This is a complex equation, so let's consider the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x = 0\) to be a valid solution, it must be in the interval \([0,1]\), which it is. For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be a valid solution, it must also be in the interval \([0,1]\). This is true if \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\), which simplifies to \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\).

Now, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must be a fixed point of \(f\) or there must be another \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's consider the case when \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is not a fixed point of \(f\). We need to check if there is another \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). This is a more complex task, but we can use the fact that the function \(f\) is a quadratic function and its graph is a parabola. The function \(f(f(x))\) is a polynomial of degree 4, and it must have at least one root in the interval \([0,1]\) other than \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f\) and its composition, we can conclude that for \(\lambda \in [1,4]\), there will always be another \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the given conditions are:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = -60^\circ + 180^\circ k\) for any integer \(k\). The simplest positive solution is \(\theta = 120^\circ\).

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the prime factorization of \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) subject to the constraints \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will first analyze the function and then use calculus to find the critical points.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \):
1. If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 1, which occurs when \( y = 0 \).
2. If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 0, which occurs when \( y = 0 \).
3. If \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1, which occurs when \( x = 0 \).
4. If \( y = -1 \), then \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 0, which occurs when \( x = 0 \).

From the above boundary values, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the region \( -1 < x, y < 1 \). To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0,
\]
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0.
\]
From the first equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \implies (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = y^2 x^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]
From the second equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \implies (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]
Thus, the critical points satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Substituting \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \) into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:
\[
f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{x^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x |x| + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
If \( x \ge 0 \), then \( |x| = x \), so:
\[
f(x, y) = x^2 + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \), so:
\[
f(x, y) = -x^2 + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}.

In both cases, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1, which occurs at \( (x, y) = (1, 0) \) and \( (x, y) = (-1, 0) \).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are the golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).

Since \( z \) is a complex number, it must be one of these roots. We will consider \( z = \phi \) and \( z = \frac{1}{\phi} \). The expression \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) will be the same for both roots because \( \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right)^{85} + \phi^{85} = \phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} \).

First, we note that \( \phi \) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). We can use this property to find a pattern in the powers of \( \phi \):
\[
\phi^3 = \phi \cdot \phi^2 = \phi(\phi + 1) = \phi^2 + \phi = (\phi + 1) + \phi = 2\phi + 1,
\]
\[
\phi^4 = \phi \cdot \phi^3 = \phi(2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2.
\]
We observe that the coefficients of \( \phi \) and the constant terms in the expressions for \( \phi^n \) follow the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, if we write \( \phi^n = F_n \phi + F_{n-1} \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number, then the recurrence relation is \( F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n \) with initial conditions \( F_1 = 1 \) and \( F_2 = 1 \).

Thus, we have:
\[
\phi^{85} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84}.

Similarly,
\[

"To find the area of triangle \(MEN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Next, we consider the line \(MN\) which is parallel to \(BC\) and intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the centroid to the sides. Specifically, since \(G\) divides the medians in the ratio 2:1, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(1:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16
\]

Now, we need to find the area of triangle \(MEN\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangle \(MEN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) and shares the same centroid \(G\). The ratio of the areas of triangles \(MEN\) and \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the areas of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) because \(G\) is the centroid and the centroid divides the medians in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, the area of triangle \(MEN\) is also \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Thus, the area of triangle \(MEN\) is:
\[

"To find the eighth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the fourth term from the equation for the eighth term:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions given and then determine the number of possible values for the sum of the digits of the number \( N \).

1. **Condition Analysis**:
   - \( N \) is a product of two prime numbers, say \( p \) and \( q \).
   - \( N \) is odd, so both \( p \) and \( q \) must be odd primes.
   - The sum of the digits of \( N \) is a multiple of 5.

2. **Sum of the Digits**:
   - The sum of the digits of a number is congruent to the number itself modulo 9. Therefore, \( N \equiv 0 \pmod{5} \) implies \( N \equiv 0 \pmod{45} \) because \( N \) is also odd.
   - So, \( N \) must be a multiple of 45.

3. **Form of \( N \)**:
   - Since \( N = pq \) and \( N \) is a multiple of 45, \( N \) must be of the form \( 45k \) where \( k \) is a product of two odd primes.
   - The smallest such \( k \) is 1, so the smallest \( N \) is 45. The sum of the digits of 45 is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \), which is not a multiple of 5.

- \( (2, 0) \)
- \( (3, 4) \)

2. Triangle 2 with vertices \( (0, 0) \), \( (2, 0) \), and \( (3, 4) \)

### Area of Triangle 1
The vertices of Triangle 1 are \( (0, 4) \), \( (0, 0) \), and \( (2, 0) \). The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:

\[

### Area of Triangle 2
The vertices of Triangle 2 are \( (0, 0) \), \( (2, 0) \), and \( (3, 4) \). Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 4) + 2(4 - 0) + 3(0 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 8 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4

   The digits available are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. We need to find all pairs of these digits that sum to 9. Let's list them:
   - \(4 + 5 = 9\)
   - \(5 + 4 = 9\)
   So, the only pair that sums to 9 is (4, 5) and (5, 4).

   The number of favorable outcomes (pairs that sum to 9) is 2. The total number of possible outcomes is 25. Therefore, the probability is:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,

\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,

\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), but a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

In cylindrical coordinates, the equation \( z = c \) simply indicates that the \( z \)-coordinate is fixed, while the \( r \) and \( \theta \) coordinates can take any values. This describes a vertical plane that extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions.

Therefore, the shape represented by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane, but in the context of the given choices, the closest and most appropriate answer is a ""सिलिंडर"" (cylinder), because a plane is a special case of a cylinder with an infinite radius.

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[
\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

Therefore, the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\pi}{6}}\).","[pi/6, '\\frac{\\pi}{6}']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",False
"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), if \( r \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( g(r) = 0 \). This implies that \( f(r+5) = 0 \). Therefore, \( r+5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \).

The sum of the roots of a polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are \( a_3 = 1 \), \( a_2 = -49 \), \( a_1 = 623 \), and \( a_0 = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Since the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r \) such that \( r+5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the sum of \( r \) for all \( r+5 \) that are roots of \( f(x) \). This is equivalent to adding 5 to each root of \( f(x) \) and summing these values. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
49 + 5 \times 3 = 49 + 15 = 64

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). Using this, we can rewrite \(\sin 20^\circ\) as \(\cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) as \(\cos 50^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to rewrite \(\cos^2 70^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cos^2 50^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 40^\circ\). So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) and \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}
\]

We can factor out the 2:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 80^\circ} \right)
\]

To simplify further, we use the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\). Therefore, \(1 + \cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ\) and \(1 - \cos 40^\circ = 2 \sin^2 20^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)\) and \(1 - \cos 80^\circ = 2 \sin^2 40^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{2 \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 40^\circ} \right)
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\) again, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) that:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 9

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of the exterior angles of the polygon is \( 1070^\circ \). The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \( 360^\circ \), regardless of the number of sides. However, the problem seems to have a mistake because the sum of the exterior angles should always be \( 360^\circ \). Let's assume the problem meant to ask for the sum of the interior angles instead.

Given that the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \), we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \( n \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{107}{18}
\]

Since \( \frac{107}{18} \) is not an integer, it seems there is a mistake in the problem statement. However, if we assume the problem meant to ask for the sum of the exterior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides, we know that the sum of the exterior angles is always \( 360^\circ \).

Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that the problem is asking for the number of sides of a polygon with a sum of interior angles of \( 1070^\circ \), which is not possible since the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( 180(n-2) \) and this value cannot be \( 1070^\circ \).

Given the problem as stated, the correct interpretation should be that the problem is asking for the number of sides of a polygon with a sum of exterior angles of \( 360^\circ \), which is always true for any polygon.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\boxed{7} (if the problem meant to ask for the number of sides of a polygon with a sum of interior angles of \( 1070^\circ \), which is not possible, but the problem is asking for the number of sides of a polygon with a sum of exterior angles of \( 360^\circ \), which is always true for any polygon, and the closest integer to \( \frac{107}{18} \) is 7, but this is not the correct interpretation of the problem as stated).)

"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is congruent to \( -t \) modulo 23. This can be written as:

\[ t + 2 \equiv -t \pmod{23} \]

First, we add \( t \) to both sides of the congruence:

\[ 2t + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we subtract 2 from both sides:

\[ 2t \equiv -2 \pmod{23} \]

Since \(-2\) is congruent to \(21\) modulo 23 (because \(-2 + 23 = 21\)), we can rewrite the congruence as:

\[ 2t \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \]

To solve for \( t \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23. The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:

\[ 2x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) to find this inverse. If we try \( x = 12 \):

\[ 2 \cdot 12 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This simplifies to:

2. Set the surface area of the other cube equal to this value and solve for its side length.

First, let's calculate the surface area of a cube with a side length of 1 foot. The surface area \(A\) of a cube with side length \(s\) is given by the formula:

Now, we need to find the side length of another cube whose surface area is also 6 square feet. Let the side length of this cube be \(a\) inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the side length in feet is \(\frac{a}{12}\) feet. The surface area of this cube is:
\[ A = 6 \left( \frac{a}{12} \right)^2 \]
We set this equal to 6 square feet:
\[ 6 \left( \frac{a}{12} \right)^2 = 6 \]
We can divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[ \left( \frac{a}{12} \right)^2 = 1 \]

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), and \(\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\), it follows that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

   To check if the lines are the same, we need to see if there is a point on the first line that is also on the second line. We can do this by setting the parametric equations equal to each other and solving for \(t\) and \(u\).

   The parametric equations of the first line are:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ -10 - 9t \\ 1 - 2t \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   The parametric equations of the second line are:
   \[
   \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \\ z \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 + 4u \\ -3 - 18u \\ 6 - 4u \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   We need to solve the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{cases}
   3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \\
   -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \\
   1 - 2t = 6 - 4u
   \end{cases}
   \]

   Simplify the first equation:
   \[
   3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4 \implies t = 2u - 4
   \]

   Substitute \(t = 2u - 4\) into the second equation:
   \[
   -10 - 9(2u - 4) = -3 - 18u \implies -10 - 18u + 36 = -3 - 18u \implies 26 = -3
   \]
   This is a contradiction, so the system of equations has no solution. Therefore, the lines are not the same.

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since the direction vectors are parallel and the lines are not the same, the lines are parallel.

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{parallel}}

"To determine the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the given rectangle, we start by identifying the coordinates of the rectangle's vertices: \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\).

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a width of \(10\) units (from \(-5\) to \(5\)) and a height of \(8\) units (from \(-4\) to \(4\)).

A lattice point inside the rectangle must have integer coordinates \((x,y)\) such that \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\). This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

To find the total number of lattice points, we count the number of possible values for \(x\) and \(y\):
- There are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible values for \(x\).
- There are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible values for \(y\).

The total number of lattice points is the product of the number of possible values for \(x\) and \(y\):
\[

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"To find the total number of stamps in the 70s, we need to add the number of stamps from each country in that decade. The table provides the following data:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) is the same as the length of \(\overline{CD}\), which we will call \(h\).

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
The area of \(\triangle BCD\) is:
\[
[\triangle BCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
Thus, the total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle BCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]
We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), which is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
To find \(a \times h\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). In \(\triangle ACD\), since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\), and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times h
\]
However, we do not need the length of \(AC\) to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) directly. We already have the relationship \((a + b) \times h = 84\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides, and \(h\) is the height, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle BCD\), but we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid.

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{21}{30} \). The greatest common divisor of \( 21 \) and \( 30 \) is \( 3 \), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( 3 \):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \( \frac{7}{10} \) back into the expression:

To simplify this, we multiply \( 70 \) by \( \frac{7}{10} \):

\[

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

First, let's fix the point \(A\) at an arbitrary position on the circle. The position of \(A\) does not affect the probability, so we can place it at any point without loss of generality.

Next, we need to consider the positions of the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) relative to \(A\). The points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be placed in any order around the circle, but for the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle starting from \(A\) and moving in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(3!\) (6) possible permutations of the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Out of these 6 permutations, only 2 will result in the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the permutations \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations).

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the smaller sector \(ADC\) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger sector \(ADC\).

First, let's calculate the areas of the sectors. The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of a sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

For the larger circle, the radius \(r = 2\). Let the central angle be \(\theta\). The area of the larger sector \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ}
\]

For the smaller circle, the radius \(r = 1\). The area of the smaller sector \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ}
\]

According to the problem, the area of the smaller sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger sector. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{5}{12} \times \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ}
\]

We can simplify this equation by canceling out \(\pi \theta\) from both sides:
\[
\frac{1}{360^\circ} = \frac{5}{12} \times \frac{1}{90^\circ}
\]

Next, we simplify the right-hand side:
\[
\frac{1}{360^\circ} = \frac{5}{1080^\circ} = \frac{1}{216^\circ}
\]

Since the equation \(\frac{1}{360^\circ} = \frac{1}{216^\circ}\) is not correct, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to the square of the radius. Since the radius of the smaller circle is half the radius of the larger circle, the area of the smaller sector is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of the larger sector. However, the problem states that the area of the smaller sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger sector, which implies that the central angle \(\theta\) must be adjusted accordingly.

Given that the area of the smaller sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger sector, we can use the fact that the area of a sector is proportional to the central angle. Therefore, the central angle \(\theta\) for the smaller sector is:
\[
\theta = \frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ

   - 0 Republicans and 5 Democrats
   - 1 Republican and 4 Democrats
   - 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats
   - 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats
   - 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

"Let the three integers be \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the problem, we have two conditions:

1. The product of the three integers is 120:

   \]

2. The arithmetic mean of the three integers is 24:
   \[
   \frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24 \implies a + b + c = 72

We need to find the largest of these three integers. Let's start by considering the factorization of 120. The possible sets of factors of 120 are:

We see that none of the sets with three distinct factors satisfy the condition \(a + b + c = 72\). Therefore, we need to consider sets with repeated factors. The only set that fits is \((1, 1, 120)\), but it does not satisfy the condition \(a + b + c = 72\).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[

Therefore, the original expression is:

"Given a triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), and \(AD = 10\) with \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Given that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we can use the fact that \(D\) lies on the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\). Let \(BD = x\) and \(DC = y\). Then \(BC = x + y\).

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{DC}{\sin \angle DBC} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC}
\]
Since \(\angle BCD = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\) and \(\angle DBC = \angle ABC = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\), we have:
\[
\frac{x}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{y}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{x + y}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{x + y}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{x + y}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
which is true but doesn't provide new information. Instead, we use the fact that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude:
\[
AM = \sqrt{AB^2 - BM^2}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\) and \(M\) is the midpoint, \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\). Let \(BC = a\), then \(BM = \frac{a}{2}\). Therefore:
\[
11 = \sqrt{AB^2 - \left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
\]
\[
11 = \sqrt{AB^2 - \frac{a^2}{4}}
\]
\[
121 = AB^2 - \frac{a^2}{4}
\]
\[
AB^2 = 121 + \frac{a^2}{4}
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). In \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta
\]
Using the Law of Sines again:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{DC}{\sin \angle DBC} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
\[
\frac{x}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{y}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{a}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
\[
\frac{x + y}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{a}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
\[
\frac{a}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta} = \frac{a}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}

This is true but doesn't provide new information. Instead, we use the fact that \(AD = 10\):

"To find the median of the 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sum and the number of integers:**
   The sum of the 27 integers is \(3^7\). First, we calculate \(3^7\):
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]
   So, the sum of the 27 integers is 2187.

2. **Determine the median:**
   The median of a set of 27 integers is the 14th integer in the ordered list. This is because the median of an odd number of integers is the middle number.

3. **Use the property of the median:**
   The sum of the first 13 integers and the last 13 integers in the ordered list is equal to the total sum of the integers. Let \(M\) be the median. The sum of the first 13 integers is less than or equal to \(13M\) and the sum of the last 13 integers is greater than or equal to \(13M\). Therefore, the sum of the first 13 integers and the last 13 integers is at least \(26M\). Since the sum of all 27 integers is 2187, we have:
   \[
   26M \leq 2187
   \]
   Solving for \(M\):
   \[
   M \leq \frac{2187}{26} \approx 84.1154
   \]
   Since \(M\) is an integer, we have:
   \[
   M \leq 84
   \]

4. **Verify the upper bound:**
   To check if \(M = 84\) is possible, we consider the sum of the first 13 integers and the last 13 integers. If \(M = 84\), then the sum of the first 13 integers is at most \(13 \times 84 = 1092\) and the sum of the last 13 integers is at least \(13 \times 84 = 1092\). The sum of the first 13 integers and the last 13 integers is:
   \[
   1092 + 1092 = 2184
   \]
   This leaves a remainder of:
   \[
   2187 - 2184 = 3
   \]
   which can be added to the 14th integer, which is 84. Therefore, the sum of the integers is:
   \[
   1092 + 84 + 1092 + 3 = 2187
   \]
   This confirms that \(M = 84\) is indeed the median.

Thus, the median of the 27 positive integers is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",81,"[81, '81']",False
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us the roots \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
This means:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Since the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\), the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

"To solve the given system of equations and find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the equations:

1. \(xyz = 4\),
2. \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\),
3. \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\).

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, we use the third equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = 12.\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]
Adding \(xyz(x + y + z)\) to both sides, we get:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) + xyz(x + y + z) = 12 + 4(x + y + z),\]
which simplifies to:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) + 4(x + y + z) = 12 + 4(x + y + z),\]
and further simplifies to:
\[xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12.\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx))\),
2. \(xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z) = 12\).

To find a solution, we assume \(x = y = z\). Substituting \(x = y = z\) into the first equation, we get:
\[x^3 = 4,\]
so \(x = \sqrt[3]{4}\). Substituting \(x = y = z = \sqrt[3]{4}\) into the second equation, we get:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 6x^3 = 6 \cdot 4 = 24,\]
which does not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, \(x = y = z\) is not a solution.

We try another approach by assuming \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\). Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:
\[xyz = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 4,\]
which satisfies the first equation. Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 + 8 = 17,\]
which does not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\) is not a solution.

Finally, we try \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\). Substituting these values into the first equation, we get:
\[xyz = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 4 = 4,\]
which satisfies the first equation. Substituting these values into the second equation, we get:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1^3 + 1^3 + 4^3 = 1 + 1 + 64 = 66,\]
which does not satisfy the second equation. Therefore, \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\) is not a solution.

We try \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\). Substituting these values into the third equation, we get:

which does not satisfy the third equation. Therefore, \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\) is not a solution.

Finally, we try \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\). Substituting these values into the third equation, we get:

which does not satisfy the third equation. Therefore, \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\) is not a solution.

We try \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\). Substituting these values into the third equation, we get:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1^2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1^2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 2^2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 8 = 28,\]
which does not satisfy the third equation. Therefore, \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\) is not a solution.

Finally, we try \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\). Substituting these values into the third equation, we get:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 1 \cdot 1^2 + 1^2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 4^2 + 1^2 \cdot 4 + 1 \cdot 4^2 + 1^2 \cdot 4 = 1 + 1 + 16 + 4 + 16 + 4 = 42,\]

The correct solution is \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\). Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

We need to find the ratio of boys to girls for each year group and then check which ratio is equal to 1.35.

1. For the 9th year group:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{41.1}{39.4} \approx 1.0435

2. For the 10th year group:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

### Step 1: Factor the denominator
The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)
\]

### Step 2: Identify the critical points
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. These points are:
- \(x^2 - 81 = 0 \implies x = \pm 9\)
- \(x(x - 36) = 0 \implies x = 0\) or \(x = 36\)

So, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

### Step 3: Determine the sign of the expression in each interval
We need to test the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

#### Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)
Choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((-\infty, -9)\).

#### Interval \((-9, 0)\)
Choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((-9, 0)\).

#### Interval \((0, 9)\)
Choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in \((0, 9)\).

#### Interval \((9, 36)\)
Choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in \((9, 36)\).

#### Interval \((36, \infty)\)
Choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((36, \infty)\).

### Step 4: Consider the critical points
The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

### Step 5: Combine the results
The expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[

"To determine the maximum area of the rectangular park within the given triangular park, we start by analyzing the given information and the diagram. The triangular park is a right triangle with a base of 400 meters and a height of 200 meters. The park is divided into two equal areas by a diagonal and a semicircle on each side of the diagonal.

First, we calculate the area of the entire triangular park:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 \times 200 = 40000 \text{ square meters}
\]
Since the park is divided into two equal areas, each area is:
\[
\text{Area of each part} = \frac{40000}{2} = 20000 \text{ square meters}
\]

The diagonal of the triangle divides it into two right triangles, each with an area of 20000 square meters. The semicircle on each side of the diagonal has a diameter equal to the length of the corresponding side of the triangle. The side lengths of the triangle are:
\[
\text{Hypotenuse} = \sqrt{400^2 + 200^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 40000} = \sqrt{200000} = 200\sqrt{5} \text{ meters}

\[
\text{Base} = 400 \text{ meters}
\]
\[
\text{Height} = 200 \text{ meters}
\]

The semicircle on the base has a radius of 200 meters, and the semicircle on the height has a radius of 100 meters. The area of the semicircle on the base is:
\[
\text{Area of the semicircle on the base} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \times 200^2 = 20000\pi \text{ square meters}
\]
The area of the semicircle on the height is:
\[
\text{Area of the semicircle on the height} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \times 100^2 = 5000\pi \text{ square meters}
\]

The total area of the semicircles is:
\[
\text{Total area of the semicircles} = 20000\pi + 5000\pi = 25000\pi \text{ square meters}

The area of the rectangular park is the area of the triangle minus the area of the semicircles:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangular park} = 40000 - 25000\pi
\]

\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = \frac{ab}{2}
\]
where \(a\) and \(b\) are the legs of the triangle. Here, \(a = 400\) meters and \(b = 200\) meters, so:
\[

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(T\), and \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\), then \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(RT\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, we have:
\[
RS^2 = RT^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(5k)^2 = RT^2 + (2k)^2
\]
\[
25k^2 = RT^2 + 4k^2
\]
\[
21k^2 = RT^2

\[
RT = \sqrt{21}k

Now, we need to find \(\sin T\). For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:

"To find the maximum distance between the origin and a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To maximize \( D \), we need to maximize the expression inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The maximum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{9}{2} \), which occurs at \( x = 0 \). Therefore, the maximum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

In the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we have \( a = 18 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[

   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):

   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the plane \( ABCD \), we first need to determine the coordinates of the point \( P \) and the equation of the plane \( ABCD \).

From the problem, we know that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 13, respectively. The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \). The distance from \( P \) to a point \( (a, b, c) \) is given by the formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2 + (z - c)^2}
\]

Using the distances given, we can write the following equations:
1. \( \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3 \)
2. \( \sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7 \)
3. \( \sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 8 \)
4. \( \sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9 \)
5. \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11 \)
6. \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2} = 13 \)

We can square these equations to eliminate the square roots:
1. \( (x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \)
2. \( (x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \)
3. \( x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64 \)
4. \( x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81 \)
5. \( x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121 \)
6. \( x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2 = 169 \)

Expanding these equations, we get:
1. \( x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \)
2. \( x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \)
3. \( x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = 64 \)
4. \( x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 = 81 \)
5. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121 \)
6. \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2z + 1 = 169 \)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth equations, we get:
2. \( 4x = 40 \) or \( x = 10 \)
3. \( 2x - 2y = 55 \) or \( 2(10) - 2y = 55 \) or \( 20 - 2y = 55 \) or \( -2y = 35 \) or \( y = -\frac{35}{2} \)
4. \( 2x + 2y = 70 \) or \( 2(10) + 2\left(-\frac{35}{2}\right) = 70 \) or \( 20 - 35 = 70 \) or \( -15 = 70 \) (This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate the problem)

However, we can use the fact that the point \( P \) lies on the plane \( ABCD \), which is the \( xy \)-plane (since \( z = 0 \)). Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (x, y, 0) \).

Using the distance from \( P \) to \( A \):
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 = 9
\]
Expanding:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 = 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2x + 1 = 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2x = 8
\]

Using the distance from \( P \) to \( B \):
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2} = 7
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 = 49
\]
Expanding:
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2x + 1 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2x = 48
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second:
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Substituting \( x = 10 \) back into the first equation:
\[
10^2 + y^2 - 2(10) = 8
\]
\[
100 + y^2 - 20 = 8
\]
\[
80 + y^2 = 8
\]
\[
y^2 = -72
\]

Since \( y^2 = -72 \) is not possible, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the fact that the point \( P \) lies on the plane \( ABCD \) and the distances are given. The correct coordinates of \( P \) are \( (1, 0, 0) \).

"To determine the ratio of the centripetal acceleration of the soft ball to the centripetal acceleration of the basketball, we start by recalling the formula for centripetal acceleration:

\[ a = \frac{v^2}{r} \]

where \( v \) is the linear velocity and \( r \) is the radius of the circular path.

Given that the linear velocity \( v \) is directly proportional to the square root of the gravitational force (which is proportional to the mass of the object), we can write:

\[ v \propto \sqrt{m} \]

where \( m \) is the mass of the object. Therefore, the centripetal acceleration \( a \) can be written as:

\[ a \propto \frac{v^2}{r} \propto \frac{(\sqrt{m})^2}{r} \propto \frac{m}{r} \]

This means that the centripetal acceleration is proportional to the mass of the object divided by the radius of the circular path.

For the soft ball, the mass \( m_s \) is 200 grams and the radius \( r_s \) is 1 meter. For the basketball, the mass \( m_b \) is 600 grams and the radius \( r_b \) is 0.5 meters. The centripetal acceleration of the soft ball \( a_s \) is proportional to:

\[ a_s \propto \frac{m_s}{r_s} = \frac{200}{1} = 200 \]

The centripetal acceleration of the basketball \( a_b \) is proportional to:

\[ a_b \propto \frac{m_b}{r_b} = \frac{600}{0.5} = 1200 \]

The ratio of the centripetal acceleration of the soft ball to the centripetal acceleration of the basketball is:

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{200}{1200} = \frac{1}{6} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the centripetal acceleration of the soft ball to the centripetal acceleration of the basketball is:

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits in the same positions:

"To find the polynomial \( g(x) \) which is the derivative of \( f(x-1) \), we first need to compute \( f(x-1) \) and then take its derivative.

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[
f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2.
\]

Next, we expand each term separately. Starting with \( (x-1)^4 \):

\[
(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1.
\]

Multiplying by 3, we get:

\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3.
\]

Next, we expand \( (x-1)^2 \):

\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1.
\]

Multiplying by 5, we get:

\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5x^2 - 10x + 5.

Now, we expand \( -9(x-1) \):

\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9.

Putting it all together, we have:

Combining like terms, we get:

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

Solving for \( p \), we get:

- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine the total amount of money in cents and dollars after the transactions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money spent in dollars.
2. Convert the total amount spent from dollars to cents.
3. Determine the remaining amount of money in dollars and cents after the transactions.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money spent in dollars:
- Linda spent \$27.47.
- Shara spent \$35.23.
- June spent \$37.37.
- Kali spent \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount spent is \$126.59.

Next, we convert the total amount spent from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine the remaining amount of money in dollars and cents after the transactions. Since the total amount spent is \$126.59, the remaining amount is \$0.00.

Therefore, the total amount of money in cents and dollars after the transactions is:
\[
\boxed{0 \text{ dollars}, 12659 \text{ cents}}

"To find the average number of words per student in the class, we need to calculate the total number of words written by all students and then divide that by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the total number of words written by the students:
- 20 students wrote 80 words each. So, the total number of words written by these students is:
  \[
  20 \times 80 = 1600
  \]
- 8 students wrote 90 words each. So, the total number of words written by these students is:
  \[
  8 \times 90 = 720
  \]
- 2 students wrote 100 words each. So, the total number of words written by these students is:
  \[
  2 \times 100 = 200
  \]

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total number of words written by all students:
\[
1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
\]

Next, we calculate the total number of students in the class:
\[
20 + 8 + 2 = 30
\]

Finally, we find the average number of words per student by dividing the total number of words by the total number of students:
\[
\text{Average} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84
\]

Therefore, the average number of words per student is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given \(4 \times 4\) grid and use the information that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote the numbers in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c & d \\
\hline
e & f & g & h \\
\hline
i & j & k & l \\
\hline
m & n & o & p \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we know the following values:
- The top row is \(n-3, 3, n+1, n+2\).
- The second row is \(2n-9, 2, n, n-1\).
- The third row is \(1, 2, n, n-1\).
- The fourth row is \(m, n, o, p\).

We need to find the value of \(n\). Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(2n-9) + 2 + n + (n-1) = 4n - 8
\]

Since the sums of the numbers in each row must be equal, we set the two sums equal to each other:
\[
3n + 3 = 4n - 8
\]

Solving for \(n\), we get:
\[
3 + 8 = 4n - 3n
\]
\[
11 = n
\]

So, the value of \(n\) is \(\boxed{11}\).

To verify, we can substitute \(n = 11\) back into the grid and check the sums:
- The first row is \(8, 3, 12, 13\), and the sum is \(8 + 3 + 12 + 13 = 36\).
- The second row is \(13, 2, 11, 10\), and the sum is \(13 + 2 + 11 + 10 = 36\).
- The third row is \(1, 2, 11, 10\), and the sum is \(1 + 2 + 11 + 10 = 24\).
- The fourth row is \(m, 11, o, p\), and the sum is \(m + 11 + o + p\).

We need to find the values of \(m, o,\) and \(p\) such that the sum of the fourth row is also 36. The sum of the first three columns is:
\[
8 + 13 + 1 + m = 22 + m
\]
\[
3 + 2 + 2 + o = 7 + o
\]
\[
12 + 11 + 11 + o = 34 + o
\]
\[
13 + 10 + 10 + p = 33 + p
\]

The sum of the first three columns must be equal to the sum of the fourth column:
\[
22 + m = 7 + o = 34 + o = 33 + p
\]

From \(22 + m = 33 + p\), we get \(m = p + 11\).
From \(7 + o = 33 + p\), we get \(o = p + 26\).

We can choose \(p = 1\), then \(m = 12\) and \(o = 27\). The fourth row is \(12, 11, 27, 1\), and the sum is \(12 + 11 + 27 + 1 = 51\).

Therefore, the value of \(n\) is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine how much farther Jim travels compared to Marth, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Marth travels. Marth travels along the length and the width of the rectangular park. The length of the park is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the total distance Marth travels is:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim travels along the diagonal of the rectangular park. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width). Therefore, the length of the diagonal is:
\[
\sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Jim travels and the distance Marth travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, Marth travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet farther than Jim.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum number of points of intersection of four circles in a plane. Let's analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Intersection of Two Circles:**
   - Two circles can intersect at most at 2 points.

2. **Intersection of Three Circles:**
   - If we have three circles, each pair of circles can intersect at most at 2 points. Since there are 3 circles, there are \(\binom{3}{2} = 3\) pairs of circles. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

3. **Intersection of Four Circles:**
   - If we have four circles, each pair of circles can intersect at most at 2 points. Since there are 4 circles, there are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) pairs of circles. Therefore, the maximum number of intersection points is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

To verify, let's consider the geometric configuration of four circles. Each circle can intersect each of the other three circles at most at 2 points. Since there are 4 circles, this gives us \(4 \times 3 \times 2 / 2 = 12\) intersection points (we divide by 2 because each intersection point is counted twice).

Thus, the maximum number of points of intersection of four circles in a plane is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",13,"[13, '13']",False
