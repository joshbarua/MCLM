"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) and \(F\) have the same \(y\)-coordinate, the distance \(EF\) is simply the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates:
\[
EF = |0 - 0| = 0
\]
However, this is incorrect because the problem states that \(EF = 7\). Therefore, the correct interpretation is that \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), and the distance \(EF\) is indeed 7 units.

Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance \(DE\) can be calculated using the distance formula:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \).
   \[
   z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method) to expand this product:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} + \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i^2 \sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i + \frac{(3 \sqrt{2} - 6)i}{2} + \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})(-1) \sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}i - 6i}{2} + \frac{-3 \sqrt{2} + 6}{2} = 1 + i + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}i}{2} - 3i + \frac{-3 \sqrt{2}}{2} + 3
   \]
   Combining like terms, we get:
   \[
   \left(1 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} + 3\right) + \left(1 - 3 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i = \left(4 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original position:**
   This is done by adding \( c \) to the rotated complex number.
   \[
   \left(4 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i + (2 - 3i) = \left(4 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} + 2\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\right)i
   \]
   \[
   = \left(6 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-5 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We then check if it is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check if it is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We then check if it is divisible by 7. We perform the division:
\[121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857\]
Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. We then check if it is divisible by 11. We perform the division:
\[121 \div 11 = 11\]
So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 by taking the square root of each factor:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine how many different ways 8 dummies can sit around a table such that 3 specific dummies (Pieter, Rose, and Thomas) sit together, we can treat Pieter, Rose, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pieter-Rose-Thomas block and the other 5 dummies) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around a table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pieter, Rose, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange 3 people in a line, which is \(6\) ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 dummies around a table such that Pieter, Rose, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pieter, Rose, and Thomas within their block:
\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of different ways 8 dummies can sit around a table such that Pieter, Rose, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees that a pentagon must be rotated to match its initial position, we need to consider the properties of a regular pentagon and the concept of rotational symmetry.

A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\). Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is therefore \(\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ\).

However, the rotational symmetry of a regular pentagon means that it can be rotated by certain angles and still look the same. The smallest positive angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself is \(\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ\). This is because a full rotation of \(360^\circ\) divided by the number of sides (5) gives the smallest angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to match its initial position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the rectangle, we start by identifying the given vertices: \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\). The fourth vertex \((x, y)\) must be such that the opposite sides of the rectangle are parallel and equal in length.

First, we calculate the lengths of the sides of the rectangle formed by the given vertices. The length of the side between \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(6-5)^2 + (8-3)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 25} = \sqrt{26}
\]
The length of the side between \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(7-6)^2 + (4-8)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17}
\]
The length of the side between \((7, 4)\) and \((5, 3)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(5-7)^2 + (3-4)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]
The length of the side between \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(6-5)^2 + (8-3)^2} = \sqrt{1 + 25} = \sqrt{26}
\]

Since the opposite sides of a rectangle are equal, the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) must be such that the distance between \((7, 4)\) and \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{17}\) and the distance between \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{5}\).

We can use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other. The midpoint of the diagonal between \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal between \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \((6, \frac{7}{2})\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This gives us the system of equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so this solution is not valid. Therefore, we need to consider the other possible configuration of the rectangle. The fourth vertex \((x, y)\) must be such that the distance between \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{5}\) and the distance between \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) is \(\sqrt{17}\).

We can use the fact that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other. The midpoint of the diagonal between \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal between \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
The midpoint of the diagonal between \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \(\left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]
This gives us the system of equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
Solving these equations, we get:
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]
Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
8 + 9 = 17

"To find \(\tan A\) given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) in a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the polynomial in the denominator. The numerator is \( 2x \), which is a polynomial of degree 1, and the denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \), which is a polynomial of degree 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( \lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( \lambda_{\max} = 16 \).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

"To solve the problem of finding \(58_9 - 18_9\) and expressing the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:

\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:
\[
\cot x.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one three-ka in terms of the weight of a cube and a goli, and then use this information to find the weight of one three-ka in terms of the weight of a cube alone. Finally, we will find the number of three-ki that are equivalent in weight to one cube.

First, let's define the weights:
- Let the weight of one three-ka be \( W_{3k} \).
- Let the weight of one cube be \( W_{\text{cube}} \).
- Let the weight of one goli be \( W_{\text{goli}} \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ten three-ki are as heavy as three cubes and one goli:
   \[
   10W_{3k} = 3W_{\text{cube}} + W_{\text{goli}}
   \]
2. Two three-ki are as heavy as one cube:
   \[
   2W_{3k} = W_{\text{cube}}
   \]

We can solve the second equation for \( W_{3k} \):
\[
W_{3k} = \frac{W_{\text{cube}}}{2}
\]

Now, substitute \( W_{3k} = \frac{W_{\text{cube}}}{2} \) into the first equation:
\[
10 \left( \frac{W_{\text{cube}}}{2} \right) = 3W_{\text{cube}} + W_{\text{goli}}
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
5W_{\text{cube}} = 3W_{\text{cube}} + W_{\text{goli}}
\]
Subtract \( 3W_{\text{cube}} \) from both sides:
\[
2W_{\text{cube}} = W_{\text{goli}}
\]
So, the weight of one goli is:
\[
W_{\text{goli}} = 2W_{\text{cube}}
\]

Now, we know that one three-ka is:
\[
W_{3k} = \frac{W_{\text{cube}}}{2}
\]

To find the number of three-ki that are equivalent in weight to one cube, we need to determine how many three-ki have a total weight equal to \( W_{\text{cube}} \). Let \( n \) be the number of three-ki. Then:
\[
nW_{3k} = W_{\text{cube}}
\]
Substitute \( W_{3k} = \frac{W_{\text{cube}}}{2} \):
\[
n \left( \frac{W_{\text{cube}}}{2} \right) = W_{\text{cube}}
\]
Multiply both sides by 2:
\[
nW_{\text{cube}} = 2W_{\text{cube}}
\]
Divide both sides by \( W_{\text{cube}} \):
\[
n = 2
\]

Therefore, the number of three-ki that are equivalent in weight to one cube is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product of the polynomials and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
3b = 6
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
b = 2
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
Simplify:
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4a = -12
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
a = -3
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16

Simplify:
\[
-10 - 6 = -16
\]
\[
-16 = -16

This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

By comparing the constant terms, we get:
\[
-2a = 6

Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[
-2(-3) = 6

Simplify:
\[
6 = 6
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the reservoir is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising.

First, let's denote the radius of the cylindrical reservoir by \( r \) meters and the height of the water by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of water in the cylindrical reservoir is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h. \]

We are given that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, so the rate of change of the volume with respect to time is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi. \]

We are also given that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so the rate of change of the height with respect to time is:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4. \]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}. \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4. \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2. \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5. \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5}. \]

Therefore, the radius of the reservoir is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) defined as follows:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of the function in each piece:
1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).
2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must reach all values greater than or equal to its minimum value, and the line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) must reach all values less than or equal to its maximum value.

### Case 1: \(a > 0\)
- The parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) has its minimum value at \(x = a\), which is \(f(a) = a^3\).
- The line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) has its maximum value as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), which is \(-\infty\).

Since the line \(ax + 2a\) can take any value less than or equal to \(-\infty\), it will always intersect any horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c \leq -\infty\). However, the parabola \(ax^2\) must also intersect any horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c \geq a^3\). Therefore, the condition is that \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value that the line \(ax + 2a\) can take as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), which is \(-\infty\). This condition is always true for \(a > 0\).

### Case 2: \(a < 0\)
- The parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) has its minimum value at \(x = a\), which is \(f(a) = a^3\).
- The line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) has its maximum value as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), which is \(-\infty\).

Since the line \(ax + 2a\) can take any value less than or equal to \(-\infty\), it will always intersect any horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c \leq -\infty\). However, the parabola \(ax^2\) must also intersect any horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c \geq a^3\). Therefore, the condition is that \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value that the line \(ax + 2a\) can take as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), which is \(-\infty\). This condition is always true for \(a < 0\).

### Case 3: \(a = 0\)
- The function becomes \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \geq 0\) and \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x < 0\). This is a constant function \(f(x) = 0\), which intersects every horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c = 0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line \(y = c\) at least once for any \(a\). However, the largest value of \(a\) that ensures the graph intersects every horizontal line at least once is not bounded. Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = \lambda \lambda x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2). \]

We are given that \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we have:

\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0. \]

This equation has two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

For the first case, \(x = 0\), we have \(f(0) = \lambda \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - 0) = 0\), so \(f(f(0)) = f(0) = 0\). This satisfies the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) but does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\) unless \(\lambda = 0\), which is not in the range \(0 < \lambda \le 4\). Therefore, \(x = 0\) is not a solution for \(\lambda > 0\).

For the second case, we need to solve:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1. \]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a cubic equation in \(x\):

\[ \lambda^4 x^3 - 2\lambda^3 x^2 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 1 - \lambda^2 = 0. \]

For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) to this equation, the discriminant of the cubic equation must be non-negative, and the polynomial must change sign in the interval \((0,1)\). However, a simpler approach is to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points.

The fixed points of \(f(x)\) are the solutions to \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x, \]
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two fixed points: \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(f(x) \neq x\), we need \(x \in (0,1)\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). The condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) implies that \(x\) must be a root of the cubic equation in \(x\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its derivative, we find that the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\) is satisfied for \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function is:

\[ f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2, \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x^2 - 4x^3 + 2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x = 0. \]

Thus, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), and \(f(x) \neq x\) for \(x \in (0,1)\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator:

\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is:
\[
\theta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ.

"To determine the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
Similarly, if \( x = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so the function simplifies to:
\[ f(-1, y) = y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
The same applies if \( y = 1 \) or \( y = -1 \). Therefore, the boundary values do not give a maximum value greater than 0.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Substituting \( y = x \) into the function, we get:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero. Let \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Then,
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \text{ or } x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( g(x) \), we get:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 1. \]
Similarly, substituting \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( g(x) \), we get:
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = -\sqrt{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = -\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -1. \]
Therefore, the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1.

To confirm that this is indeed the maximum value of the original function \( f(x, y) \), we consider the geometric interpretation. The function \( f(x, y) \) represents the dot product of the vectors \( \left( x, \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) \) and \( \left( y, \sqrt{1 - y^2} \right) \). The maximum value of the dot product of two vectors is the product of their magnitudes, which is:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + (1 - x^2)} \sqrt{y^2 + (1 - y^2)} = \sqrt{1} \sqrt{1} = 1. \]
This maximum value is achieved when the vectors are parallel, i.e., when \( y = x \) and both \( x \) and \( y \) are positive or both are negative. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The corresponding angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \frac{7\pi}{10} \).

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Since \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \theta = \frac{7\pi}{10} \), we have:

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{10} = \frac{255\pi}{10} = 25.5\pi = 25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{10} = \frac{595\pi}{10} = 59.5\pi = 59\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}. \]

In both cases, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 0 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(MEN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\), and the line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). The centroid \(G\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio in which the centroid divides the median, which is \(2:3\). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. The area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64.

3. Calculate the total number of remaining books on all three rafts.
4. Determine how many books on mathematics remain after taking out two books from each raft.

Let's start with the initial number of books on each raft:
- The total number of books is 24.
- The number of books on thegoroth raft is 8.
- The number of books on the average raft is 10.
- The number of books on the dilution raft is 6.

Next, we calculate the number of books left on each raft after taking out two books:

- The number of books left on the average raft is \(10 - 2 = 8\).
- The number of books left on the dilution raft is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

Now, we calculate the total number of remaining books on all three rafts:

Next, we determine how many books on mathematics remain after taking out two books from the average raft:
- The number of books on mathematics that remain is \(10 - 2 = 8\).

- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the 14th term \(a_{14} = 200\) and the 8th term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write:

\[ a_{14} = a_1 + 13d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the 8th term from the equation for the 14th term:

\[ (a_1 + 13d) - (a_1 + 7d) = 200 - 500 \]
\[ 6d = -300 \]
\[ d = -50 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the 8th term to find the first term \(a_1\):

The prime factorization of 150 is:

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Paul and Jack is even, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to determine the parity (odd or even) of each of these prime numbers:
- 2 is even.
- 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are odd.

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In this case, since there is only one even number (2) among the first six prime numbers, it is impossible for both Paul and Jack to select even numbers. Therefore, the only way for the sum of the numbers selected by Paul and Jack to be even is if both Paul and Jack select odd numbers.

There are 5 odd numbers among the first six prime numbers. The probability that Paul selects an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Jack selects an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Since the selections are independent, the probability that both Paul and Jack select odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Paul and Jack is even is \(\boxed{\frac{25}{36}}\).","[25/36, '\\frac{25}{36}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To determine the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) and the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = a \) and \( y = b \) into the equation of the line.
2. Since \( a = 4 \), substitute \( a \) with 4 in the equation.
3. Solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the equation of the line:
\[ 3x + 2y = 12 \]

Substitute \( x = 4 \) and \( y = b \) into the equation:
\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( b \):
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( b \):
\[ b = 0 \]

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given figure, we need to analyze the arrangement and calculate the area of each shaded portion step by step.

The figure consists of a 3x4 grid with a diagonal line from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and two additional horizontal lines dividing the grid into three horizontal strips. The shaded regions are the areas below the diagonal line in each of the three horizontal strips.

1. **Identify the area of each horizontal strip:**
   - The entire grid is a 3x4 rectangle, so its area is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12
     \]
   - Since the grid is divided into three horizontal strips of equal height (4 units each), the area of each strip is:
     \[
     \frac{12}{3} = 4
     \]

2. **Determine the area of the shaded regions in each strip:**
   - The diagonal line divides each strip into two regions of equal area. Therefore, the area of the shaded region in each strip is half of the area of the strip:
     \[
     \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]

3. **Calculate the total area of the shaded regions:**
   - Since there are three strips, the total area of the shaded regions is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

Thus, the total area of the shaded regions is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",10,"[10, '10']",False
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include at least one factor of 2, one factor of 9, and two factors of 5. To ensure the number consists only of the digits 0 and 1, it must be a power of 10 (since any other digit would introduce a factor other than 2, 3, or 5).

The smallest power of 10 that is a multiple of 450 is 450 itself, but 450 contains the digit 5. Therefore, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 0 and 1.

We can use a systematic approach to find this number. We start by multiplying 450 by the smallest integers and checking the resulting numbers for the digit 5:

\[ 450 \times 1 = 450 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 2 = 900 \quad \text{(contains 9)} \]
\[ 450 \times 3 = 1350 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 4 = 1800 \quad \text{(contains 8)} \]
\[ 450 \times 5 = 2250 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 6 = 2700 \quad \text{(contains 7)} \]
\[ 450 \times 7 = 3150 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 8 = 3600 \quad \text{(contains 6)} \]
\[ 450 \times 9 = 4050 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 10 = 4500 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]

We see that none of these products contain only the digits 0 and 1. We continue this process until we find the smallest number that meets the criteria.

After further calculation, we find:

\[ 450 \times 22 = 9900 \quad \text{(contains 9)} \]
\[ 450 \times 23 = 10350 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 24 = 10800 \quad \text{(contains 8)} \]
\[ 450 \times 25 = 11250 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 26 = 11700 \quad \text{(contains 7)} \]
\[ 450 \times 27 = 12150 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 28 = 12600 \quad \text{(contains 6)} \]
\[ 450 \times 29 = 13050 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]
\[ 450 \times 30 = 13500 \quad \text{(contains 5)} \]

We continue this process until we find:

\[ 450 \times 222 = 99900 \quad \text{(contains 9)} \]

"To determine the probability that the pawn will be placed on a white square on a chessboard, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Chessboard:**
   - A standard chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, making a total of 64 squares.
   - Half of these squares are white, and the other half are black.

2. **First Number (Modulo 4):**
   - The first number is obtained by dividing the column number by 4 and taking the remainder.
   - The possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, and 3.
   - Each remainder corresponds to a different column on the chessboard:
     - Remainder 0: Column 4, 8 (both white)
     - Remainder 1: Column 1, 5, 9, 13 (all black)
     - Remainder 2: Column 2, 6, 10, 14 (all black)
     - Remainder 3: Column 3, 7, 11, 15 (all black)

3. **Second Number (Modulo 5):**
   - The second number is obtained by dividing the row number by 5 and taking the remainder.
   - The possible remainders are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Each remainder corresponds to a different row on the chessboard:
     - Remainder 0: Row 5, 10, 15, 20 (all black)
     - Remainder 1: Row 1, 6, 11, 16 (all white)
     - Remainder 2: Row 2, 7, 12, 17 (all white)
     - Remainder 3: Row 3, 8, 13, 18 (all white)
     - Remainder 4: Row 4, 9, 14, 19 (all white)

4. **Finding the Intersection:**

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). So, the fraction becomes:
\[

\]

Next, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:

\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This gives us:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) again to rewrite the expression in terms of sine:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]
So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). We need to find a way to simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

We use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The identity states that:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ - x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ + x)} = 24.

For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = 24.

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The sum of the interior angles is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \). Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \( x \). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ + x \). Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since the measure of an interior angle of a polygon must be less than \( 180^\circ \), we have:

\[
0 < x < 180
\]

Substituting \( x \) in the equation, we get:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

To find the range for \( n \), we first find the value of \( 180(n-2) \) when \( x \) is at its maximum, which is just less than \( 180 \). Therefore, we can approximate:

\[
180(n-2) \approx 1070 + 180
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
180(n-2) \approx 1250
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \):

\[
n-2 \approx \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

\[
n-2 \approx 6.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round \( 6.9444 \) to the nearest whole number, which is \( 7 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
n-2 = 7
\]

Solving for \( n \), we get:

\[
n = 9
\]

To verify, we calculate the sum of the interior angles of a 9-sided polygon:

\[
180(9-2) = 180 \times 7 = 1260
\]

If the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \), then the missing angle \( x \) is:

\[
x = 1260 - 1070 = 190

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080

If the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \), then the missing angle \( x \) is:

\[
x = 1080 - 1070 = 10

First, we expand the left side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23}. \]
Now, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:
\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ (-5)^2 = 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv -1 + 18 \pmod{23} \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are valid solutions. However, the problem asks for the unique odd integer, and both solutions are odd, so we need to check which one satisfies the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19, \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

Next, we need to find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). This is equivalent to squaring the expression \(5 + \sqrt{3}\).

"To determine the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers starting with 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we first recognize that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:
\[
a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
a_n = 1 + 2(n-1) = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1
\]
Thus, the \(n\)-th term of the sequence is \(a_n = 2n - 1\).

To find the 2003rd term, we substitute \(n = 2003\) into the formula:
\[

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[ d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} \]

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}

Now, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[

\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}

Now, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates will be strictly inside the rectangle defined by the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - The length of the rectangle is the distance between \(x = -5\) and \(x = 5\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
   - The width of the rectangle is the distance between \(y = -4\) and \(y = 4\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

2. **Determine the range of integer coordinates inside the rectangle:**
   - The integer \(x\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\) (since the points on the boundary are not included).
   - The integer \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-3\) to \(3\) (since the points on the boundary are not included).

3. **Calculate the number of integer points in the range:**

   - There are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) integer \(y\)-coordinates.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[

\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

"To find the average price of Juan's stamps from the 70s, we need to calculate the total number of stamps and the total cost of these stamps, and then divide the total cost by the total number of stamps.

- **70s:**
  - Brazil: 12 stamps at 6 cents each
  - France: 12 stamps at 4 cents each
  - Peru: 6 stamps at 4 cents each
  - Spain: 13 stamps at 9 cents each

  Total number of stamps: \(12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43\)
  Total cost: \(12 \times 6 + 12 \times 4 + 6 \times 4 + 13 \times 9 = 72 + 48 + 24 + 117 = 261\) cents

- **80s:**
  - Brazil: 8 stamps at 12 cents each
  - France: 15 stamps at 12 cents each
  - Peru: 3 stamps at 4 cents each
  - Spain: 9 stamps at 13 cents each

  Total number of stamps: \(8 + 15 + 3 + 9 = 35\)
  Total cost: \(8 \times 12 + 15 \times 12 + 3 \times 4 + 9 \times 13 = 96 + 180 + 12 + 117 = 305\) cents

Now, let's find the total number of stamps and the total cost for all the decades combined:

- Total number of stamps: \(43 + 35 = 78\)
- Total cost: \(261 + 305 = 566\) cents

The average price per stamp is the total cost divided by the total number of stamps:

\[

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{d}{a} = \frac{b}{c}

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42

where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid.

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) is equal to \(CD = c\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42 \implies (a + b) \times c = 84

Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c

To find \(a \times c\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of the height \(c\) and the base \(a\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector, it divides \(\triangle ABC\) into two triangles with equal areas. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. Therefore, the area of the larger circle is:
   \[
   \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
   \[
   \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

3. **Identify the shaded regions:**
   The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. The larger segment is part of the outer circle and the smaller segment is part of the inner circle. The area of the larger segment is the area of the sector of the outer circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\), and the area of the smaller segment is the area of the sector of the inner circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\).

4. **Calculate the area of the triangle \(ADC\):**
   The triangle \(ADC\) is an isosceles triangle with \(AD = 1\) and \(CD = 2\). The height of the triangle from \(D\) to \(AC\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. Let \(h\) be the height. Then:
   \[
   h^2 + 1^2 = 2^2 \implies h^2 + 1 = 4 \implies h^2 = 3 \implies h = \sqrt{3}

   Let \(\theta\) be the central angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the outer circle is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta

   The area of the larger segment is:

   The radius of the inner circle is 1. The area of the sector of the inner circle is:

   \]
   The area of the smaller segment is:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{2} - \sqrt{3}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total area of the shaded region:**
   The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
   \[
   (2\theta - \sqrt{3}) + \left(\frac{\theta}{2} - \sqrt{3}\right) = \frac{5\theta}{2} - 2\sqrt{3}
   \]
   We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
   \[
   \frac{5\theta}{2} - 2\sqrt{3} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Solving for \(\theta\):
   \[
   \frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} + 2\sqrt{3} \implies \theta = \frac{2}{5} \left(\frac{5\pi}{3} + 2\sqrt{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{5}

   \theta = \left(\frac{2\pi}{3} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{5}\right) \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{5} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120 + \frac{4\sqrt{3}}{5} \times \frac{180}{\pi}
   \]
   However, since the problem asks for the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees, and the term \(\frac{4\sqrt{3}}{5} \times \frac{180}{\pi}\) is very small and does not affect the integer part, we can approximate:
   \[
   \theta \approx 120
   \]

Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",120,"[120, '120']",True
"To determine how many spherical meniscus containers with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm are needed to fill a spherical reservoir with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the meniscus containers and the reservoir and then find the ratio of the reservoir volume to the meniscus container volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of one meniscus container. The volume \( V \) of a spherical cap (which is what a meniscus container is) is given by the formula:
\[ V = \frac{\pi h^2}{3} (3r - h) \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere and \( h \) is the height of the cap. For the meniscus container, \( r = 3 \) cm and \( h = 8 \) cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V = \frac{\pi (8)^2}{3} (3 \cdot 3 - 8) = \frac{\pi \cdot 64}{3} (9 - 8) = \frac{64\pi}{3} \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the reservoir, \( r = 6 \) cm. Plugging in this value, we get:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many meniscus containers are required to fill the reservoir. This is done by dividing the volume of the reservoir by the volume of one meniscus container:
\[ \text{Number of meniscus containers} = \frac{288\pi}{\frac{64\pi}{3}} = \frac{288\pi \cdot 3}{64\pi} = \frac{864}{64} = 13.5 \]

Since we cannot have half a meniscus container, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need 14 meniscus containers to fill the reservoir.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{14} \]","[14, '14']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's denote:
\[ \alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \]
\[ \beta = \arcsin 0.5 \]

This means:
\[ \sin \alpha = 0.4 \]
\[ \sin \beta = 0.5 \]

We need to find:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) \]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha \]

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\):
\[ \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]
\[ \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Now, substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \]

\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \]

Now, multiply these two results together:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) \]

This is a product of two binomials:
\[ = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100} \]

Using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[ = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3})^2 - (\sqrt{21})^2}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100} = -\frac{9}{100} \]

Thus, the value of the expression is:

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.
2. Convert minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute.

Let's start with the given speed of 20 feet per minute.

Step 1: Convert feet to inches.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate composed of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is \(\boxed{26000}\).","[26000, '26000']",26000,"[26000, '26000']",True
"To find the three consecutive integers whose product is 120 and whose arithmetic mean is 24, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the three consecutive integers:**
   Let the three consecutive integers be \( n \), \( n+1 \), and \( n+2 \).

2. **Set up the equation for the product:**
   The product of these three integers is given by:
   \[
   n(n+1)(n+2) = 120
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the arithmetic mean:**
   The arithmetic mean of these three integers is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n + (n+1) + (n+2)}{3} = 24
   \]
   Simplifying the numerator, we get:
   \[
   \frac{3n + 3}{3} = 24
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[
   n + 1 = 24
   \]
   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   n = 23
   \]

4. **Verify the product with \( n = 23 \):**
   Substitute \( n = 23 \) into the product equation:
   \[
   23 \cdot 24 \cdot 25
   \]
   First, calculate \( 23 \cdot 24 \):
   \[
   23 \cdot 24 = 552
   \]
   Next, calculate \( 552 \cdot 25 \):
   \[
   552 \cdot 25 = 13800
   \]
   So, the product is 13800, which is not 120. This indicates that there might be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct approach.

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   The correct approach is to solve the polynomial equation \( n(n+1)(n+2) = 120 \) and check the arithmetic mean condition. Let's try to find the roots of the polynomial:
   \[
   n^3 + 3n^2 + 2n - 120 = 0
   \]
   By trial and error or using the Rational Root Theorem, we can test possible rational roots. Testing \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   5^3 + 3 \cdot 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5 - 120 = 125 + 75 + 10 - 120 = 90 \quad \text{(not a root)}
   \]
   Testing \( n = 6 \):
   \[
   6^3 + 3 \cdot 6^2 + 2 \cdot 6 - 120 = 216 + 108 + 12 - 120 = 216 \quad \text{(not a root)}
   \]
   Testing \( n = 4 \):
   \[
   4^3 + 3 \cdot 4^2 + 2 \cdot 4 - 120 = 64 + 48 + 8 - 120 = 0 \quad \text{(a root)}
   \]
   So, \( n = 4 \) is a root. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \).

6. **Verify the arithmetic mean:**
   The arithmetic mean of \( 4 \), \( 5 \), and \( 6 \) is:
   \[
   \frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   This does not match the given arithmetic mean of 24. Therefore, there might be an error in the problem constraints or interpretation. However, based on the correct interpretation and solution, the correct answer should be re-evaluated.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

5. Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we select \(x = 66\).

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:
\[

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB}.
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), so \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we get:
\[
\sin \angle BDC = \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta.
\]
Using the Law of Sines again in \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{2BM}{\sin \theta} = \frac{2 \cdot AB \sin \theta}{\sin \theta} = 2AB = \frac{22}{\cos \theta}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BC = \frac{22 (3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta)}{\cos \theta}.
\]

Now, we use the fact that \( \sin \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \) and \( \cos \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \). Substituting these into the expression for \( BC \), we get:
\[

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\):

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]

Thus, \(a = 81 - 13 = 68\). The 27 consecutive integers are therefore:

\[
68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94
\]

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th number in the sequence. To find the 14th number, we add 13 to the first number:

\[
68 + 13 = 81

Therefore, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 4)\). Since \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\) and \(x^2 + 4 > 0\) for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^2(x^2 + 4)\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\). To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\).

Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]
So the roots are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is \(-7 < y < 3\).

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have \(0 \leq y < 3\). Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is \(\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}\).","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).

We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right),
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{24}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{24}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),

\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 3p\right),

"To determine which class has the highest percentage of students who picked an auto bus, we need to compare the percentage of students who picked an auto bus to the percentage of students who picked a bus for each class. The class with the highest percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus for that class will be the answer.

Let's calculate the percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus for each class:

1. For the 9th class:
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus: \(41.1\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked a bus: \(39.4\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus: \(\frac{41.1}{39.4} \times 100 \approx 104.32\%\)

2. For the 10th class:
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus: \(34.4\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked a bus: \(33.1\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus: \(\frac{34.4}{33.1} \times 100 \approx 103.96\%\)

3. For the 11th class:
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus: \(20.6\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked a bus: \(13.8\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus: \(\frac{20.6}{13.8} \times 100 \approx 150\%\)

4. For the 12th class:
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus: \(11.6\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked a bus: \(8.6\%\)
   - Percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus: \(\frac{11.6}{8.6} \times 100 \approx 134.88\%\)

From the calculations, we can see that the 11th class has the highest percentage of students who picked an auto bus relative to the percentage of students who picked a bus, which is approximately \(150\%\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   - Choose \(x = -10\).
   - The numerator \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-10)(-10 - 36) = (-10)(-46) = 460\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   - Choose \(x = -1\).
   - The numerator \(|(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   - Choose \(x = 1\).
   - The numerator \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   - Choose \(x = 10\).
   - The numerator \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((10)(10 - 36) = (10)(-26) = -260\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   - Choose \(x = 37\).
   - The numerator \(|37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangle. Let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
2L + 2W = 400
\]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:

\[
L + W = 200
\]

Next, we express the width \( W \) in terms of the length \( L \):

\[
W = 200 - L
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:

\[
A = L \times W
\]

Substituting the expression for \( W \) into the area formula, we get:

\[
A = L \times (200 - L) = 200L - L^2
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( A = -L^2 + 200L \), which is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 200 \), so the length \( L \) that maximizes the area is:

\[
L = -\frac{200}{2(-1)} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]

Substituting \( L = 100 \) back into the equation \( W = 200 - L \), we find:

\[
W = 200 - 100 = 100

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are \( L = 100 \) meters and \( W = 100 \) meters. The maximum area \( A \) is:

\[
A = 100 \times 100 = 10000

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to use the properties of right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
   - \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\).

2. **Understand the definition of sine:**
   - \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
   - In \(\triangle RST\), the opposite side to angle \(R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\).
   - Therefore, \(\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}\).

3. **Determine the length of the sides:**
   - Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   - So, \(RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2\).
   - Substituting the known values, we get \((5k)^2 = RS^2 + (2k)^2\).
   - Simplifying, we have \(25k^2 = RS^2 + 4k^2\).
   - Solving for \(RS^2\), we get \(RS^2 = 21k^2\).
   - Taking the square root of both sides, we get \(RS = \sqrt{21}k\).

5. **Find \(\sin{T}\):**
   - \(\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
   - In \(\triangle RST\), the opposite side to angle \(T\) is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\).
   - Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}k}{5k} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) as:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \]
Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}. \]
Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:

To minimize \(D\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is:

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}, \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}. \]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}. \]
In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any positive integer other than 1, we have:

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other. The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex be \( x \).

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a property of the regular polyhedron and can be derived from the fact that the octahedron can be inscribed in a sphere.

The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2
\]

Calculating the squares of the given distances, we get:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 324 + x^2
\]

The sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices multiplied by 2. Since the center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, and there are 6 vertices, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is:
\[
6 \times \left(\frac{\text{edge length}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 6 \times \frac{a^2}{2} = 3a^2

\[
6 \times \left(\frac{\text{edge length}}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 6 \times \frac{a^2}{2} = 3a^2

"To solve the problem, we start by using the given formula for force, which states that the force is equal to the mass multiplied by the acceleration. This can be written as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

In this problem, the force applied to both the football and the baseball is the same because they are being hit with the same force. Let's denote this force by \( F \).

For the baseball, the mass \( m_b \) is 200 g, and the acceleration \( a_b \) is \( a_b \). Therefore, the force can be expressed as:

\[ F = m_b \cdot a_b = 200 \cdot a_b \]

For the baseball, the mass \( m_a \) is 150 g, and the acceleration \( a_a \) is \( a_a \). Therefore, the force can also be expressed as:

\[ F = m_a \cdot a_a = 150 \cdot a_a \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the two expressions for the force equal to each other:

\[ 200 \cdot a_b = 150 \cdot a_a \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the baseball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_a}{a_b} \):

\[ \frac{a_a}{a_b} = \frac{200}{150} = \frac{4}{3} \]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

Using the identity \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we have \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_2\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

First, we calculate the quotient:
\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]
This means that 6 can be multiplied by 9 to get 54:
\[ 6 \times 9 = 54 \]

Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, the remainder is 0. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many pairs of coins remain after Linda, Шeri, Джун, and Koni exchange their coins for pairs, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they have together.
2. Determine how many pairs of coins they can form with that total amount.
3. Calculate the number of coins left after forming the pairs.

First, let's find the total amount of money they have:
\[
\text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine how many pairs of coins they can form. Since each pair consists of 2 coins, we divide the total amount by 2:
\[
\text{Number of pairs} = \left\lfloor \frac{126.59}{2} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 63.295 \right\rfloor = 63
\]

This means they can form 63 pairs of coins. Since each pair consists of 2 coins, the total number of coins used is:
\[
63 \times 2 = 126
\]

The original total number of coins is:
\[
4 \times 3 = 12
\]

Since 126 coins are used, the number of coins left is:
\[
126 - 12 = 114
\]

However, we need to find the number of pairs of coins left, which is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{126.59}{2} \right\rfloor = 63
\]

So, the number of pairs of coins left is:
\[
\boxed{63}

"To find the average score of the class on the test, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Determine the number of students who received each score:
   - 20 students received a score of 80.
   - 8 students received a score of 90.
   - 2 students received a score of 100.

2. Calculate the total score for each group of students:
   - The total score for the students who received 80 is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - The total score for the students who received 90 is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - The total score for the students who received 100 is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

3. Add these total scores together to get the overall total score for the class:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

4. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students to find the average score:
   \[
   \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84

Therefore, the average score of the class on the test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given magic square is valid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \). Let's check the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the square to be magic, the sum of the second row must also be \( 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify this value of \( n \) by substituting \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and checking the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

The magic square becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sum of the first row:

\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the second row:

\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the third row:

\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the first column:

\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the second column:

\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the third column:

\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the main diagonal:

\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the other diagonal:

\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Distance Mark travels compared to Distance Jim, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Distance Jim travels. Distance Jim travels along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]
For Distance Jim, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Distance Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Distance Mark travels. Distance Mark travels along the length and the width of the field. The total distance \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = l + w
\]
For Distance Mark, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
d = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Distance Mark travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Distance Mark travels and the distance Distance Jim travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Distance Mark travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet more than Distance Jim.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that visits all three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) starting and ending at point \(A\), we need to consider all possible permutations of the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The shortest path will be the minimum of these distances.

First, let's list the distances between the points:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 3\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(BD = 5\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will now consider all permutations of the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) and calculate the total distance for each permutation.

1. Permutation \(B \to C \to D \to B\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD + DB = 5 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 20
   \]

2. Permutation \(B \to D \to C \to B\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC + CB = 5 + 5 + 4 + 6 = 20
   \]

3. Permutation \(C \to B \to D \to C\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD + DC = 6 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 21
   \]

4. Permutation \(C \to D \to B \to C\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB + BC = 6 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21

5. Permutation \(D \to B \to C \to D\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC + CD = 3 + 5 + 6 + 4 = 18
   \]

6. Permutation \(D \to C \to B \to D\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB + BD = 3 + 4 + 6 + 5 = 18
   \]

From the above calculations, the shortest path is either \(D \to B \to C \to D\) or \(D \to C \to B \to D\), both with a total distance of 18.

Therefore, the shortest path that visits all three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) starting and ending at point \(A\) is \(\boxed{18}\).","[18, '18']",13,"[13, '13']",False
