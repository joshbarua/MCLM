"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(EF\) intersects \(EF\), and \(F\) is the point on the x-axis directly below \(D\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2\). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the squares, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) clockwise:**
   A clockwise rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) is equivalent to a counterclockwise rotation by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \). The rotation of a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise is given by:
   \[
   (a + bi)(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)
   \]
   For \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( \cos(-\frac{\pi}{4}) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( \sin(-\frac{\pi}{4}) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, the rotation is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) - 3 \sqrt{2}i \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \frac{2}{2} - \frac{2}{2}i \right) - \left( \frac{6}{2}i - \frac{6}{2}i^2 \right)
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   z'' = (1 - i) - (3i + 3) = 1 - 3 - i - 3i = -2 - 4i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (-2 - 4i) + (2 - 3i) = -2 + 2 - 4i - 3i = -7i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. Since \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), we have:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 ljudi can sit around a circular table, we need to consider that rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical. This is different from arranging people in a line, where each permutation is distinct.

When arranging \( n \) people in a line, the number of permutations is \( n! \) (n factorial), which is the product of all positive integers up to \( n \). However, when arranging \( n \) people around a circular table, one person's position is fixed to account for rotational symmetry. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements is \( (n-1)! \).

In this problem, \( n = 8 \). So, the number of ways to arrange 8 ljudi around a circular table is:

\[

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the minimal number of degrees a regular polygon must be rotated to match its original position, we need to consider the properties of rotational symmetry of a regular polygon.

A regular polygon with \( n \) sides has rotational symmetry of order \( n \). This means that it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) degrees and still look the same. To find the minimal number of degrees required to rotate the polygon to match its original position, we need to find the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( k \cdot \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) is a multiple of \( 360^\circ \).

This \( k \) is simply \( n \), because \( n \cdot \frac{360^\circ}{n} = 360^\circ \), which is a full rotation and thus matches the original position.

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), and the condition \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and their sum for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 1 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 16 \). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalent of \(18_9\) from the base \(10\) equivalent of \(58_9\):
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent of \(x\), so we can write:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one square of cheese in terms of the weight of one tree. Let's denote the weight of one tree as \( T \) and the weight of one square of cheese as \( S \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Ten trees are as heavy as three squares of cheese and one goolee.
2. Two trees and one goolee weigh the same as one square of cheese.

We can express these pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \( 10T = 3S + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)

We need to find the weight of one square of cheese in terms of the weight of one tree, which means we need to eliminate \( G \) from the equations. We can do this by solving the second equation for \( G \) and substituting it into the first equation.

From the second equation:
\[ G = S - 2T \]

Now substitute \( G \) in the first equation:
\[ 10T = 3S + (S - 2T) \]
\[ 10T = 4S - 2T \]
\[ 12T = 4S \]
\[ S = 3T \]

So, the weight of one square of cheese is equal to the weight of three trees. Therefore, the weight of one tree is one-fourth the weight of one square of cheese.

Now, we need to find out how many trees weigh the same as one square of cheese. Since one square of cheese weighs the same as three trees, the number of trees that weigh the same as one square of cheese is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the pravocilindrični spremnik, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

### Step 1: Initial Conditions
The spremnik initially fills the vessel at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. Let the initial radius be \( r_1 \) and the initial height be \( h_1 \). The initial volume \( V_1 \) is:

\[ V_1 = \pi r_1^2 h_1 \]

The rate of change of volume is given by:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

### Step 2: Rate of Change of Height
We are also given that the height of the water rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. Therefore, \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Using the volume formula, we differentiate both sides with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r_1^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r_1^2 \cdot 4 \]

Solving for \( r_1^2 \):

\[ 20 = 4 r_1^2 \]
\[ r_1^2 = 5 \]
\[ r_1 = \sqrt{5} \]

### Step 3: New Conditions
When the spremnik is full, the height of the water is \( h_2 \). The new volume \( V_2 \) is:

\[ V_2 = \pi r_1^2 h_2 \]

Since the spremnik is full, the height \( h_2 \) is the same as the height of the vessel. The rate of change of volume remains the same, so:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

### Step 4: Rate of Change of Height When Full
The height of the water rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Using the volume formula again, we differentiate both sides with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r_1^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r_1^2 \cdot 4 \]

This equation is the same as the one we solved for \( r_1 \), confirming that the radius \( r_1 \) is indeed \( \sqrt{5} \).

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) piecewise and ensure that it covers all possible \(y\)-values.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
  \[ f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]
  As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
  \[ f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]
  As \(x\) decreases, \(f(x)\) decreases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

### Step 3: Combine the ranges for both pieces
- If \(a > 0\), the overall range of \(f(x)\) is the union of \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\), which is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a] \cup [a^3, \infty)\). For the graph to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of the range must be less than or equal to the maximum value:
  \[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
  Solving this inequality:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \leq -1\) or \(0 < a \leq 2\). Since \(a > 0\), we have \(0 < a \leq 2\).

- If \(a < 0\), the overall range of \(f(x)\) is the union of \((-\infty, a^3]\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\), which is \((-\infty, a^3] \cup (a^2 + 2a, \infty)\). For the graph to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the maximum value of the range must be greater than or equal to the minimum value:
  \[ a^2 + 2a \geq a^3. \]
  Solving this inequality:
  \[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0, \]
  \[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(a \leq -1\) or \(0 < a \leq 2\). Since \(a < 0\), we have \(a \leq -1\).

### Step 4: Determine the largest value of \(a\)
From the above analysis, the largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is also satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) other than the fixed points, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(f(x))\).

For \(\lambda = 4\), the function \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\) has a maximum value of 1 at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{3}{4}\). The function \(f(f(x))\) will have a periodic point of period 2 in the interval \((0, \frac{1}{2})\) and \((\frac{1}{2}, 1)\).

For \(1 < \lambda < 4\), the function \(f(x)\) has a maximum value of \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) at \(x = \frac{\lambda}{2}\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). The function \(f(f(x))\) will have a periodic point of period 2 in the interval \((0, \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda})\) and \((\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}, 1)\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S, and S is 1 each.

\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 0 \) to maximize \( f(1, y) = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is maximized when \( y = 0 \). Similarly, if \( x = -1 \), then \( y = 0 \) to maximize \( f(-1, y) = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is maximized when \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can use the substitution \( x = \sin \theta \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then the function becomes:
\[ 2 \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin 2\theta. \]
The maximum value of \( \sin 2\theta \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Therefore, \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Substituting these values back into the original function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]

we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the given equation becomes

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to determine the value of \( \cos(85\theta) \). Notice that \( \cos\theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we have \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \sin\theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2} = \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \).

However, we do not need the exact value of \( \sin\theta \) to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Instead, we use the fact that \( \cos(85\theta) \) is periodic with period \( 2\pi \) and that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(85\theta \mod 2\pi) \).

Since \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \), we can use the properties of roots of unity to find that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(0) = 1 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(EFG\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

The line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\). Since \(G\) divides the medians in the ratio 2:1, the line \(MN\) is the midline of the triangle formed by the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\). This triangle is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(1:3\).

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its side lengths. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively, and \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), the area of triangle \(AMN\) is also \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(EFG\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(EFG\) is:

We are given two specific terms of the sequence:
- The fourth term \(a_4 = 200\)
- The eighth term \(a_8 = 500\)

Using the general form of the arithmetic sequence, we can write the equations for the fourth and eighth terms as:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the fourth term from the equation for the eighth term:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are \(2\) and \(5^2\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:

This shows that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 8th power.

- Each petice is worth 10 cents.

Next, we calculate the total value of the kovanice:

Since the total value of all the coins is not given, we assume that the total value of the petice is the only unknown part of the total value. However, we can still find the number of petice by using the value of one petice.

The value of one petice is 10 cents, so the number of petice is:

Since the total value of the petice is not given directly, we can only determine the number of petice based on the information provided. The problem does not provide the total value of the petice, so we cannot calculate the exact number of petice without additional information.

However, if we assume that the total value of the petice is the only unknown part of the total value and that the total value of the petice is the only part that is not given, we can still find the number of petice by using the value of one petice.

Since the problem does not provide the total value of the petice, we cannot calculate the exact number of petice. Therefore, the problem is not solvable with the given information.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is a prime number, given that each of them chooses a distinct prime number from the first six prime numbers.

First, let's list the first six prime numbers:
\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\]

Paul and Jesse each choose one of these numbers, and they must choose different numbers. Therefore, there are \(6 \times 5 = 30\) possible pairs of numbers that they can choose.

Next, we need to identify which of these pairs have a sum that is a prime number. We will check each possible pair:

- If Paul chooses 2, the possible sums are:
  \[2 + 3 = 5, \quad 2 + 5 = 7, \quad 2 + 7 = 9, \quad 2 + 11 = 13, \quad 2 + 13 = 15\]
  The prime sums are 5 and 7. So, the valid pairs are (2, 3) and (2, 5).

- If Paul chooses 3, the possible sums are:
  \[3 + 2 = 5, \quad 3 + 5 = 8, \quad 3 + 7 = 10, \quad 3 + 11 = 14, \quad 3 + 13 = 16\]
  The only prime sum is 5. So, the valid pair is (3, 2).

- If Paul chooses 5, the possible sums are:
  \[5 + 2 = 7, \quad 5 + 3 = 8, \quad 5 + 7 = 12, \quad 5 + 11 = 16, \quad 5 + 13 = 18\]
  The only prime sum is 7. So, the valid pair is (5, 2).

- If Paul chooses 7, the possible sums are:
  \[7 + 2 = 9, \quad 7 + 3 = 10, \quad 7 + 5 = 12, \quad 7 + 11 = 18, \quad 7 + 13 = 20\]
  There are no prime sums. So, there are no valid pairs.

- If Paul chooses 11, the possible sums are:
  \[11 + 2 = 13, \quad 11 + 3 = 14, \quad 11 + 5 = 16, \quad 11 + 7 = 18, \quad 11 + 13 = 24\]
  The only prime sum is 13. So, the valid pair is (11, 2).

- If Paul chooses 13, the possible sums are:
  \[13 + 2 = 15, \quad 13 + 3 = 16, \quad 13 + 5 = 18, \quad 13 + 7 = 20, \quad 13 + 11 = 24\]
  There are no prime sums. So, there are no valid pairs.

From the above, the valid pairs are (2, 3), (2, 5), (3, 2), (5, 2), and (11, 2). There are 5 valid pairs.

The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is a prime number is the number of valid pairs divided by the total number of possible pairs:

Therefore, the probability is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{6}}\).","[1/6, '\\frac{1}{6}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To determine the value of \( b \) when the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \) and \( a = 4 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = 4 \) and \( y = b \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \).
2. Solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

To isolate \( 2b \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Now, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]
\[ b = 0 \]

"To determine the total area of the region that is not shaded, we need to find the area of the entire rectangle and then subtract the area of the shaded region.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the entire rectangle. The entire rectangle has a length of 3 units and a width of 4 units. Therefore, the area of the entire rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of the entire rectangle} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

Next, let's find the area of the shaded region. The shaded region consists of two smaller rectangles. The first smaller rectangle has a length of 2 units and a width of 4 units, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the first smaller rectangle} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]
The second smaller rectangle has a length of 1 unit and a width of 4 units, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the second smaller rectangle} = 1 \times 4 = 4
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two smaller rectangles:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = 8 + 4 = 12
\]

Now, we subtract the area of the shaded region from the area of the entire rectangle to find the area of the region that is not shaded:
\[
\text{Area of the region that is not shaded} = 12 - 12 = 0

Therefore, the total area of the region that is not shaded is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that has all digits as 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of the number and the divisibility rules for 450. The number 450 can be factored into \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25\). Therefore, the number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 9.
3. **Divisibility by 25**: The last two digits of the number must be 00 or 25. Since the number must end in 0, the last two digits must be 00.

Given these conditions, the number must end in 00 and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. Let's start by considering the smallest number that meets these criteria.

We can write a number in the form \(111\ldots1100\). Let \(n\) be the number of 1's in the number. Then the number is \(100 \times \frac{10^n - 1}{9}\). We need to find the smallest \(n\) such that the sum of the digits of this number is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of \(100 \times \frac{10^n - 1}{9}\) is the same as the sum of the digits of \(\frac{10^n - 1}{9}\), which is \(n\).

Therefore, \(n\) must be divisible by 9. The smallest \(n\) that satisfies this condition is 9. So, the number is \(11111111100\).

Let's verify:
- The number \(11111111100\) ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 9\), which is divisible by 9.
- The last two digits are 00, so it is divisible by 25.

"To determine the probability that the figure is postable on the white square of the chessboard, we need to analyze the process of selecting the row and column for the figure and then check if the selected square matches the white square.

1. **Selecting the Row:**
   - The figure is selected by dividing the first number by 4 and finding the remainder.
   - The possible remainders are 1, 2, and 3.
   - Therefore, there are 3 possible rows.

2. **Selecting the Column:**
   - The figure is selected by dividing the second number by 5 and finding the remainder.
   - The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Therefore, there are 4 possible columns.

3. **Total Number of Possible Squares:**
   - Since there are 3 possible rows and 4 possible columns, the total number of possible squares is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12
     \]

4. **Identifying the White Square:**
   - On a chessboard, the white squares are arranged such that the white square in the top-left corner is the square where the row and column remainders are both 1.
   - Therefore, the white square is the square where the row and column remainders are both 1.

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - There is only 1 white square out of the 12 possible squares.
   - Therefore, the probability that the figure is postable on the white square is:

Thus, the probability that the figure is postable on the white square of the chessboard is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{12}}\).","[1/12, '\\frac{1}{12}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine the sum of the digits in the final decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by \( -a \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:

\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f(r+5) = 0 \) implies \( r+5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-x) = -\sin x\), we have \(\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \cdot \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{3 \tan^2 40^\circ}{4 \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

However, we can use a known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of its internal angles, except one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the internal angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the internal angles except one:**
   Let the measure of the missing internal angle be \(x\). Then, the sum of the internal angles except one is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   Since the polygon is convex, each internal angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(x < 180^\circ\).

5. **Set up the inequality and solve for \(n\):**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ

   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444

6. **Verify the maximum possible value of \(n\):**
   If \(n = 8\), then the total sum of the internal angles is:
   \[

   The missing angle \(x\) would be:

   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

The odd solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since we are asked for the unique odd solution, we need to check which one satisfies the original condition. Both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are odd, so we need to verify which one is the correct solution by checking the modular inverse condition.

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

Since both solutions are valid, the unique odd solution is the one that is not the other solution. However, the problem asks for the unique odd solution, and both solutions are valid, so we need to re-evaluate the problem statement or the context in which it was given. If the problem is asking for the unique solution in a specific context or if there is a specific solution that is not the other, we need that context to determine the correct answer.

The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This is because the radical conjugate of a number \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\), and vice versa.

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). We can use the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To determine the position of Koji in the sequence of non-negative odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we need to recognize that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

For our sequence, the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. Therefore, the \(n\)-th term \(a_n\) of the sequence is:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[ d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} \]

Here, \(\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[ (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2) \]

\[ = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) \]

\[ \| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89} \]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[ d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \]

From these vertices, we can see that the length of the rectangle is the distance between \(x = 5\) and \(x = -5\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\). The width of the rectangle is the distance between \(y = 4\) and \(y = -4\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

The rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). To find the number of integer coordinate points strictly inside the rectangle, we need to count the points where \(x\) ranges from \(-4\) to \(4\) and \(y\) ranges from \(-3\) to \(3\).

\[

[ABCD] = [ABC] + [ACD] = 42.
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \theta \cos \theta.
\]

However, since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we can also express the area of \(\triangle ABC\) as:
\[
[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \theta \cos \theta.
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the product of the legs of the right triangle:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC^2.
\]

Given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21.
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can use geometric probability and combinatorial arguments.

First, consider the circle and the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on it. The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the four points. However, since the circle has no starting point, each unique arrangement of points is counted 4 times (once for each starting point). Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of the points is \(\frac{4!}{4} = 6\).

Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points are in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of distinct arrangements:
\[

Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) where the two circles with radii 1 and 2 intersect. The total area of the overlapping region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the overlapping region is:
\[
\text{Area of the overlapping region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the overlapping region in terms of the angle \(\angle ADC\). The overlapping region consists of two circular segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle.

The area of a circular segment of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is given by:
\[
\text{Area of the segment} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

For the smaller circle with radius 1, the area of the segment is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1)
\]
For the larger circle with radius 2, the area of the segment is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment in the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2) = 2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2)
\]

The total area of the overlapping region is the sum of these two segments:
\[
\text{Total area of the overlapping region} = \frac{1}{2} (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1) + 2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2)
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{1}{2} (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1) + 2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Since \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) are the central angles subtended by the chords of intersection in the smaller and larger circles, respectively, and they are equal (because the circles are symmetric and the problem states that the smaller angle is the one we are looking for), we have \(\theta_1 = \theta_2 = \theta\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) + 2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\frac{5}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}

We need to find the value of \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution. To convert this angle to degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical cups are needed to fill a spherical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical cups and the spherical container, and then divide the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical cup.

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical cup. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical cup, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical container, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical cups are needed to fill the spherical container, we divide the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical cup:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical cups} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

Thus, the expression becomes:

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from miles per minute to miles per second, we start with the given speed of 20 miles per minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can find the speed in miles per second by dividing the speed in miles per minute by 60.

\[
\text{Speed in miles per second} = \frac{20 \text{ miles per minute}}{60 \text{ seconds per minute}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ miles per second}

Next, we need to convert the speed from miles per second to inches per second. There are 5280 feet in a mile and 12 inches in a foot, so there are \(5280 \times 12 = 63360\) inches in a mile. Therefore, we multiply the speed in miles per second by 63360 to get the speed in inches per second.

\[

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senatski odbor that includes at least one member from each party (republikanaca and demokrata), we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that do not meet the criteria (i.e., subcommittees that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 republikanaca + 6 demokrata):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of subcommittees that are all from one party. There are two cases to consider: all members are republikanaca, or all members are demokrata.

1. The number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members all from republikanaca is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

2. The number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members all from demokrata is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Add these two results together to get the total number of subcommittees that are all from one party:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract the number of subcommittees that are all from one party from the total number of subcommittees to get the number of subcommittees that have at least one member from each party:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error or by using numerical methods. Let's try some integer values for \(x\):

If \(x = 4\):
\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This works, so the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we need to check if the second condition is satisfied. The arithmetic mean (arithmetic sredinom) of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1
\]
For \(x = 4\), the arithmetic mean is:
\[
4 + 1 = 5
\]
We are given that the product of the three integers divided by their arithmetic mean is 24. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24
\]
Since \(x+1 \neq 0\) (because \(x = 4\)), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
x(x+2) = 24
\]
Substituting \(x = 4\) into the equation, we get:
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

This is true, so the values \(x = 4\), \(x+1 = 5\), and \(x+2 = 6\) satisfy both conditions.

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

x = -64 + 2 = -62

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \]
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{AB} \]

Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD} \]

Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - \angle BDC}{2} = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[ \sin \angle BDC = \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]
\[ \sin \angle BCD = \sin \angle CBD = \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} \]

Using the identity \( \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 3\theta}{2}} \) and \( \cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta \):
\[ \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta}{2}} \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle. By symmetry and the given conditions, we can deduce that \( \theta = 30^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ \sin \theta = \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\sin \theta} = 22 \]
\[ BC = 2AB \sin \theta = 2 \times 22 \times \frac{1}{2} = 22 \]

Since \( AB = AC \):
\[ AC = 22 \]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. We know that:

The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)

"To determine the real values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's introduce a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \( y = x^2 \). Since \( x^2 \) is always non-negative, \( y \geq 0 \). The inequality then becomes:
\[ -4 < y^2 + 4y < 21. \]

We will solve this compound inequality by breaking it into two separate inequalities:
1. \( y^2 + 4y > -4 \)
2. \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \)

**Step 1: Solve the inequality \( y^2 + 4y > -4 \).**

Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0. \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0. \]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a parabola that opens upwards and has its vertex at \( y = -2 \). It is positive for all \( y \neq -2 \). Since \( y = x^2 \geq 0 \), the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is satisfied for all \( y \geq 0 \). Therefore, the solution to the first inequality is:
\[ y \geq 0. \]

**Step 2: Solve the inequality \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \).**

Rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0. \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0. \]
The expression \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is a parabola that opens upwards and has its roots at \( y = -7 \) and \( y = 3 \). It is negative between the roots, so the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is satisfied for \( -7 < y < 3 \). Since \( y = x^2 \geq 0 \), the solution to the second inequality is:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3. \]

**Step 3: Combine the solutions of the two inequalities.**

The solution to the compound inequality \( -4 < y^2 + 4y < 21 \) is the intersection of the solutions to the two separate inequalities:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3. \]
Since \( y = x^2 \), we substitute back to get:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Therefore, the real values of \( x \) that satisfy the original inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and substitutions.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using the identity \(x+y+z = s\) and \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we can express \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12.\]
Expanding and combining like terms, we have
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
We can rewrite the left-hand side as
\[s^2p - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
Using the identity \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we substitute \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\):
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 + 3 \cdot 4 = 16.\]
Thus, the equation becomes
\[s^2p - (16 + x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
We know that \(x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12\), so the equation simplifies to
\[s^2p - (16 + sp - 12) = 12,\]
which further simplifies to
\[s^2p - sp - 4 = 12,\]
or
\[s^2p - sp = 16.\]
Factoring out \(sp\) on the left-hand side, we get
\[sp(s - 1) = 16.\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(sp(s - 1) = 16\).

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as
\[p = \frac{16}{s(s-1)}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{16}{s(s-1)}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{48}{s(s-1)}\right) = s^3 - \frac{48}{s-1}.\]
Multiplying through by \(s-1\), we get
\[-8(s-1) = s^3(s-1) - 48,\]
or
\[-8s + 8 = s^4 - s^3 - 48,\]
or
\[s^4 - s^3 + 8s - 56 = 0.\]
We can test possible rational roots of this polynomial. Testing \(s = 2\), we get
\[2^4 - 2^3 + 8 \cdot 2 - 56 = 16 - 8 + 16 - 56 = -32 \neq 0.\]
Testing \(s = 4\), we get
\[4^4 - 4^3 + 8 \cdot 4 - 56 = 256 - 64 + 32 - 56 = 168 \neq 0.\]
Testing \(s = 7\), we get
\[7^4 - 7^3 + 8 \cdot 7 - 56 = 2401 - 343 + 56 - 56 = 2058 \neq 0.\]
Testing \(s = 1\), we get
\[1^4 - 1^3 + 8 \cdot 1 - 56 = 1 - 1 + 8 - 56 = -48 \neq 0.\]
Testing \(s = 2\), we get
\[2^4 - 2^3 + 8 \cdot 2 - 56 = 16 - 8 + 16 - 56 = -32 \neq 0.\]
Testing \(s = 2\), we get

- The percentage of female students using the internet is 39.4%.
- The ratio of male to female students using the internet is:

- The percentage of female students using the internet is 33.1%.
- The ratio of male to female students using the internet is:

Next, let's move to the 11th grade:
- The percentage of male students using the internet is 20.6%.
- The percentage of female students using the internet is 13.8%.
- The ratio of male to female students using the internet is:

- The percentage of female students using the internet is 8.6%.
- The ratio of male to female students using the internet is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality will change signs at \(x = 9\), \(x = -9\), and \(x = 0\), \(x = 36\).

Next, we need to determine the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined, which means these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

"To determine the area of the rectangular field in the atleticko staze, we need to analyze the given information and the diagram. The staze consists of a rectangle with two semicircles on either end. The total length of the staze is 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two semicircles together form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The circumference of the full circle is given by:
\[ 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W \]

The total length of the staze is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumference of the full circle:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We need to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]

To express \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we solve the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \) for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi W}{2}\right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100 \]

The area of the rectangle is:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), we get:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that \(RT = 5\), we can find \(RS\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
RS = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

\[

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance between a point \((x, y)\) on the curve and the origin. The distance \(D\) is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Next, we simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives:

\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

So, the critical points are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\).

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\).

Now, we find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinates:

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

So, the points on the curve closest to the origin are \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\).

The distance from the origin to either of these points is:

\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the minimum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), which can be written as \(\frac{a}{b}\) where \(a = \sqrt{10}\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) must be positive integers and \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any other integer, we have \(a = 5\) and \(b = 2\).

Therefore, \(a + b = 5 + 2 = 7\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other. The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let the distances to the other two vertices be \( d_6 \) and \( d_7 \).

Since the octahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a property of the regular polyhedron and can be derived from the fact that the octahedron can be inscribed in a sphere.

The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 + d_7^2
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[
3^2 = 9
\]
\[
7^2 = 49
\]
\[
8^2 = 64
\]
\[
9^2 = 81
\]
\[
11^2 = 121
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

So, the sum of the squares of the distances is:
\[
324 + d_6^2 + d_7^2
\]

For a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus three times the square of the distance from the point to the center. Since the center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is a constant, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is also a constant.

However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices plus three times the square of the distance from the point to the center. Since the center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is a constant, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is also a constant.

Given that Jenine and Jack are using the same force to throw their respective balls, we can set the forces equal to each other:
\[ F_{\text{Jenine}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]
Using the formula \( F = m \cdot v \), we can write:
\[ m_{\text{Jenine}} \cdot v_{\text{Jenine}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot v_{\text{Jack}} \]
We need to find the ratio of the ubrzanja Jenine loote \( v_{\text{Jenine}} \) to the ubrzanja Jackovu \( v_{\text{Jack}} \):

"To determine the number of common digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

3. No vješćica se trudila rukovati s drugim vješćicima.
4. No čarobnjak se podnose s drugim čarobnjakima.
5. No čarobnjak se rukovisi se s drugim vješćicima.

From the above information, we can see that each of the 6 vješćicima rukovisi se s svakim od 10 čarobnjaka. Since each rukovanja involves one vješćica and one čarobnjak, and each vješćica rukovisi se s svakim čarobnjakom, the total number of rukovanja is calculated by multiplying the number of vješćicima by the number of čarobnjaka.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by noting that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:

\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4.
\]
Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We use the identity for the product of the sums of products of the roots:

Thus, we have:
\[

\]
We now have the system of equations:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4.

The possible values for \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 4t^2 - 4 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4\). Testing \(t = 2\), we get:
\[
2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 - 4 = 8 - 16 - 4 = -12 \neq 0.

Testing \(t = -2\), we get:
\[
(-2)^3 - 4 \cdot (-2)^2 - 4 = -8 - 16 - 4 = -28 \neq 0.

Testing \(t = 1\), we get:
\[

Testing \(t = -1\), we get:
\[
(-1)^3 - 4 \cdot (-1)^2 - 4 = -1 - 4 - 4 = -9 \neq 0.

Since none of the rational roots work, we conclude that the roots are not rational. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots is 4 and the product of the roots is -4 to find the values.

- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie had in total before converting their kvančice, we need to add up their individual contributions. The contributions are as follows:

- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

First, we add these amounts together:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add these step by step:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they had before converting their kvančice is \$126.59. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert \$126.59 to cents:

\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money that remained in the novac after converting the kvančice is \(\boxed{12659}\) cents.","[12659, '12659']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the total score for each group of students:
   - 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for this group is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for this group is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for this group is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

3. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students to get the average score:
   \[
   \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84
   \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square is valid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
This is true for any \( n \), so it is consistent.

Next, let's verify the sums of the columns. The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]
For the square to be magic, the sum of the second column must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = 7
\]

Finally, let's verify the sums of the diagonals. The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
4n - 13 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n = 14 \implies n = 7
\]

The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 3n - 6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
n = 7
\]

Since all the sums are equal when \( n = 7 \), the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many meters less Jim hods than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim hods diagonally across the rectangular field. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 meters and the width \(w\) is 300 meters. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ meters}
\]
So, Jim travels 500 meters.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha hods along the length and the width of the field. The total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ meters}
\]
Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ meters}
\]
Therefore, Jim hods \(\boxed{200}\) meters less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the possible values of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance that can be traveled to visit all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to consider all possible permutations of the points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The points are given with the following distances:

- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)

### Permutation 1: \(A \to B \to C \to D\)
The distance is:
\[ AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15 \]

### Permutation 2: \(A \to B \to D \to C\)
The distance is:
\[ AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13 \]

### Permutation 3: \(A \to C \to B \to D\)
The distance is:
\[ AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \]

### Permutation 4: \(A \to C \to D \to B\)
The distance is:
