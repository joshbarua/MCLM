"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point on the y-axis directly above \(F\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units. The point \(D\) is located at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\), which means the y-coordinate of \(D\) is 7. Since \(E\) is directly above \(F\) and \(F\) is at the origin \((0,0)\), the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0,7)\).

The length of \(DE\) is the horizontal distance between the points \(D\) and \(E\). The x-coordinate of \(D\) is \(\sqrt{51}\) and the x-coordinate of \(E\) is 0. Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is simply the difference between these x-coordinates:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51} - 0 = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \) (since clockwise rotation is negative counterclockwise):**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) around the origin is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right) + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right)
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   = 1 - i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \):
   \[
   = 1 - i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})
   \]
   Combining like terms:
   \[
   = 1 + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2}) + \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2}) - 1 \right)i
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2} - 1 \right)i

   \[
   = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 - 1 \right)i

   \[
   = -2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 4 \right)i

3. **Translate back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = \left( -2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 4 \right)i \right) + (2 - 3i)

"To estimate \(\sqrt{242}\), we can find two perfect squares between which 242 lies. We know that:

\[15^2 = 225 \quad \text{and} \quad 16^2 = 256\]

Since \(225 < 242 < 256\), it follows that:

\[15 < \sqrt{242} < 16\]

To get a more precise estimate, we can use a linear approximation. The function \(f(x) = \sqrt{x}\) is approximately linear between \(x = 225\) and \(x = 256\). The slope of the line connecting the points \((225, 15)\) and \((256, 16)\) is:

\[\text{slope} = \frac{16 - 15}{256 - 225} = \frac{1}{31}\]

Using this slope, we can approximate \(\sqrt{242}\) as follows:

\[\sqrt{242} \approx 15 + \frac{242 - 225}{31} = 15 + \frac{17}{31} \approx 15 + 0.5484 = 15.5484\]

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 ljudi around a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 ljudi) around a circle.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a circle is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are distinct individuals, they can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.

Therefore, the total number of arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[

\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the behavior of a regular pentagon when it is rotated around its center. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When the pentagon is rotated in the opposite direction of the wind (which is typically counterclockwise), it will eventually align with its initial position after a certain number of rotations.

The key is to determine the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position. Since a regular pentagon has five sides, a full rotation (360 degrees) will bring the pentagon back to its original position after five counterclockwise rotations. Therefore, the smallest positive angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Thus, the smallest number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to align with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and the value of \(x + y\), we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let the coordinates of the fourth vertex be \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \((6, \frac{7}{2})\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied by \(x = 6\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is not \((6, -1)\) but another point that satisfies the condition \(x > 7\).

Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct interpretation of the problem. The correct fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. Let's re-calculate the correct fourth vertex.

The correct fourth vertex should be \((x, y)\) such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. The correct calculation should be:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and their sum for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( \lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( \lambda_{\max} = 16 \).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \):
\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

In this problem, the exponent \(2^{235423523}\) is a very large number, but it does not change the fundamental property of exponentiation with base 1. Therefore, we can conclude that:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalent of \(18_9\) from the base \(10\) equivalent of \(58_9\):
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified expression is:

2. Two treekov are as heavy as one square.

Let's denote the weight of one treekov as \( T \), the weight of one square as \( S \), and the weight of one google as \( G \). From the given information, we can write the following equations:

1. \( 10T = 3S + G \)
2. \( 2T = S \)

From the second equation, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( T \):
\[ S = 2T \]

\[ P(t) = 3t^2 + 5t + a \]
\[ Q(t) = 4t^2 + bt - 2 \]

The product of these polynomials is given by:

\[ P(t) \cdot Q(t) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6 \]

First, we expand the product \(P(t) \cdot Q(t)\):

\[ (3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) \]

We will distribute each term in \(P(t)\) to each term in \(Q(t)\):

1. \(3t^2 \cdot (4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2\)
2. \(5t \cdot (4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t\)
3. \(a \cdot (4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a\)

Now, we combine all these results:

\[ 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a \]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[ 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a \]

We now equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from this polynomial to the coefficients in the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\) (This is already matched)
2. Coefficient of \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. Coefficient of \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. Coefficient of \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step:

From the constant term equation:
\[ -2a = 6 \]
\[ a = -3 \]

From the coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[ 3b + 20 = 26 \]
\[ 3b = 6 \]
\[ b = 2 \]

Now we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the other equations to verify:

From the coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[ -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \] (Match)

From the coefficient of \(t\):
\[ -10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16 \] (Match)

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct.

"To determine the radius of the base of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

In this problem, the reservoir is initially full of water, and the volume of water is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters. When the reservoir is not full, the water level is 4 meters below the top of the reservoir. Let the height of the water when the reservoir is not full be \( h' \). Therefore, the height of the water when the reservoir is full is \( h' + 4 \) meters.

The volume of water when the reservoir is not full is:
\[ V' = \pi r^2 h' \]
Since the volume of water when the reservoir is full is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, we have:
\[ \pi r^2 (h' + 4) = 20\pi \]
We can divide both sides of the equation by \( \pi \):
\[ r^2 (h' + 4) = 20 \]

When the reservoir is not full, the height of the water is \( h' \), and the volume of water is \( \pi r^2 h' \). However, we do not have the exact value of \( h' \), but we know that the volume of water when the reservoir is not full is less than the volume when it is full. The key is to recognize that the volume of water when the reservoir is not full is the volume of a cylinder with height \( h' \) and radius \( r \), and this volume is less than the volume of a cylinder with height \( h' + 4 \) and radius \( r \).

Since the volume of water when the reservoir is not full is \( \pi r^2 h' \), and we know that \( \pi r^2 (h' + 4) = 20\pi \), we can solve for \( h' \):
\[ h' = \frac{20 - 4r^2}{r^2} \]

However, we do not need the exact value of \( h' \) to find the radius \( r \). We can use the fact that the volume of water when the reservoir is not full is less than the volume when it is full, and the difference in height is 4 meters. Therefore, we can use the equation:
\[ r^2 (h' + 4) = 20 \]
and the fact that \( h' \) is less than \( h' + 4 \).

To find the radius \( r \), we can use the fact that the volume of water when the reservoir is not full is \( \pi r^2 h' \), and the volume of water when the reservoir is full is \( \pi r^2 (h' + 4) = 20\pi \). Therefore, we can solve for \( r \):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20}{h' + 4} \]
Since \( h' \) is less than \( h' + 4 \), we can use the fact that the volume of water when the reservoir is not full is \( \pi r^2 h' \), and the volume of water when the reservoir is full is \( \pi r^2 (h' + 4) = 20\pi \). Therefore, we can solve for \( r \):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects the line \(y = x\) at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise and find the conditions under which it intersects the line \(y = x\).

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\).

**Case 1: \(x \geq a\)**

For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[ ax^2 = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ ax^2 - x = 0. \]
Factoring out \(x\), we get:
\[ x(ax - 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{1}{a}. \]
Since we are considering the case \(x \geq a\), we need \(x = \frac{1}{a} \geq a\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{1}{a} \geq a. \]
Multiplying both sides by \(a\) (assuming \(a > 0\)), we get:
\[ 1 \geq a^2. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ 1 \geq a \quad \text{or} \quad a \leq 1. \]
So, for \(x \geq a\), the function intersects the line \(y = x\) if \(0 \leq a \leq 1\).

**Case 2: \(x < a\)**

For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[ ax + 2a = x. \]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[ ax - x = -2a. \]
Factoring out \(x\) on the left side, we get:
\[ x(a - 1) = -2a. \]
So, the solution is:
\[ x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}. \]
Since we are considering the case \(x < a\), we need:
\[ \frac{-2a}{a - 1} < a. \]
To solve this inequality, we first find a common denominator:
\[ \frac{-2a}{a - 1} < \frac{a(a - 1)}{a - 1}. \]
Since \(a - 1\) must be positive (because if \(a - 1\) is negative, the inequality direction changes), we can multiply both sides by \(a - 1\) without changing the direction:
\[ -2a < a^2 - a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^2 + a > 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[ a(a + 1) > 0. \]
The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ a < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a > 0. \]
So, for \(x < a\), the function intersects the line \(y = x\) if \(a > 0\).

Combining the results from both cases, we see that the function \(f(x)\) intersects the line \(y = x\) at least once if \(0 < a \leq 1\). The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this condition is \(a = 1\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \(x\), so we have:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(a\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(a) \neq a\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f\) and its fixed points.

A fixed point of \(f\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\). So, we solve:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Factoring out \(x\), we get:

\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]

This gives us two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This inequality is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Now, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, but not a fixed point. The function \(f\) is a quadratic function, and the graph of \(f(x)\) is a parabola opening downwards with its vertex at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The value of \(f\) at the vertex is:

\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}. \]

For \(f(x)\) to have a periodic point of period 2, the value of \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\) must be in the interval \([0,1]\) and not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). The value of \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\) is:

\[ f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

This value is equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), so it is not a periodic point of period 2.

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) in degrees for which the given equation holds, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side of the equation. The given equation is:

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),

\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word contains repeated letters. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, S, where the letter L appears twice and the letter S appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter I, \( n_3 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter P, \( n_4 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter S, \( n_5 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter S, \( n_6 \), is 2.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{1! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!} = \frac{7!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

So, \( 2! \cdot 2! \cdot 2! = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8 \).

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 8 \):

\[
\frac{5040}{8} = 630

Therefore, the number of distinct permutations of the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{630}\).","[630, '630']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",False
"To determine the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of 42, we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the factorial.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher powers of 5 will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then
\[ f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then
\[ f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then
\[ f(-1, 1) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then
\[ f(-1, -1) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]

Now, consider the case when \( x = y \). Then
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero. Let \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Then
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Since \( x = y \), we have \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( f(x, y) \), we get
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]

we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the given equation becomes

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to determine the value of \( \cos(85\theta) \). Notice that \( \cos\theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we have \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \sin\theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2} = \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \).

However, we do not need the exact value of \( \sin\theta \) to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). Instead, we use the fact that \( \cos(85\theta) \) is periodic with period \( 2\pi \) and that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(85\theta \mod 2\pi) \).

Since \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0 \), we can use the properties of roots of unity to find that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(0) = 1 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(EFG\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it divides triangle \(ABC\) into two smaller triangles \(AGN\) and \(AGM\) that are similar to triangle \(ABC\) and to each other. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. In this case, the ratio of the corresponding sides is \(AG:AB = 2:3\), so the ratio of the areas of triangles \(AGN\) and \(ABC\) is \((2/3)^2 = 4/9\).

This means that the area of triangle \(AGN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), and the area of triangle \(AGM\) is also \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Therefore, the area of the quadrilateral \(MNG\) is the remaining part of triangle \(ABC\), which is \(1 - \frac{4}{9} = \frac{5}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it divides the area of triangle \(ABC\) into two equal parts, each of which is \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the fourth term from the equation for the eighth term:

"To determine how many positive integer divisors of 100 are also divisors of 150, we need to find the common divisors of both numbers. We can do this by first finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:

A number is a divisor of both 100 and 150 if it is a product of the prime factors of both numbers with exponents that do not exceed those in the factorizations. Therefore, the common prime factors are 2 and 5, and the possible exponents for 2 are 0 or 1 (since 2 appears at most to the power of 1 in the factorization of 150), and the possible exponents for 5 are 0 or 2 (since 5 appears at most to the power of 2 in both factorizations).

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all either 0 or 1, we start by finding the prime factorization of 450. We have:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2. \]
A number that is a multiple of 450 must include these prime factors in its factorization. We need to find the smallest number composed of the digits 0 and 1 that contains these factors.

First, we note that a number composed of the digits 0 and 1 that is divisible by 2 must end in 0. Next, we need to ensure that the number is divisible by \(3^2 = 9\). A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Therefore, the number must have a sum of digits that is a multiple of 9.

We also need the number to be divisible by \(5^2 = 25\). A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00. Therefore, the number must end in 00.

Given these conditions, the number must end in 00 and the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is 11111111100, because it has 9 digits, all of which are 1, and the sum of its digits is 9, which is divisible by 9.

We can verify that 11111111100 is divisible by 450:
\[ 11111111100 \div 450 = 24691111.1111\ldots \]
Since 11111111100 is not an integer multiple of 450, we need to find the next number that meets all the criteria. The next number is 111111111000, but it has 11 digits, which is not the smallest.

The correct approach is to find the smallest number composed of the digits 0 and 1 that is divisible by 450. We can use a systematic approach or a computer program to find this number. The correct answer is:

"To determine the probability that the knight is placed on the central square of a chessboard after the described process, we need to analyze the steps involved and the possible outcomes.

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each step:**
   - The first step involves dividing the number on the first kernal by 4, which gives a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 0. However, since the number is a valid chessboard square number (1 to 64), the remainders are 1, 2, 3, or 0.
   - The second step involves dividing the number on the second kernal by 5, which gives a remainder of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 0. Again, since the number is a valid chessboard square number (1 to 64), the remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 0.

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 possible remainders for the first step.
   - There are 5 possible remainders for the second step.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

3. **Identify the favorable outcome:**
   - The favorable outcome is when the knight is placed on the central square of the chessboard. The central square of a standard 8x8 chessboard is the square at position (4,4), which corresponds to the number 33 (since the squares are numbered from 1 to 64 in a standard chessboard).
   - We need to check if 33 can be expressed as a remainder when divided by 4 and 5.
   - When 33 is divided by 4, the remainder is \(33 - 8 \times 4 = 1\).
   - When 33 is divided by 5, the remainder is \(33 - 6 \times 5 = 3\).
   - Therefore, 33 is a valid number that satisfies both conditions.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - Since there is only one favorable outcome (33) out of the 20 possible outcomes, the probability is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

Thus, the probability that the knight is placed on the central square of the chessboard is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}\).","[1/20, '\\frac{1}{20}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the final decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the properties of the sine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

This equation describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(c\) along the \(z\)-axis. In other words, for any values of \(x\) and \(y\), the value of \(z\) is always \(c\).

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) is:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} \text{ or } \theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}.
\]

The smallest possible angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}.

To convert this angle to degrees, we use the fact that \(\pi\) radians is \(180\) degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{6} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 30^\circ.

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \).

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-30^\circ) = -\sin 30^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}\), we have:

\[
\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression that:

\[
\cos 10^\circ \cos 40^\circ \cos 70^\circ = \frac{\sin 80^\circ}{8 \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{\cos 10^\circ}{8 \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{8 \tan 10^\circ}.
\]

Therefore:

\[
\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ = \left( \frac{1}{8 \tan 10^\circ} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{64 \tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Substituting this back, we get:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{64 \tan^2 10^\circ}} \right) = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 \tan^2 10^\circ \right) = 48 \tan^2 40^\circ \tan^2 10^\circ.

However, we need to use another identity to find the exact value. It is known that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Determine the measure of the missing interior angle:**
   Let the measure of the missing interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]
   Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x\), we get:
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Find the range for the missing interior angle:**
   For a convex polygon, each interior angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]
   Substituting the expression for \(x\) from the previous equation, we get:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Adding \(1070^\circ\) to both sides, we get:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\), we get:
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Adding \(1070^\circ\) to both sides, we get:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\), we get:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplifying the right side, we get:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444

   Adding 2 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   n < 8.9444

   n \leq 8

   From the two inequalities, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

The two solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since we are asked for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \).

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function \( g(x) \):
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

Therefore, the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions are:

\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

We need to check if these solutions are valid by ensuring they satisfy the original equation. Both solutions are real numbers, and they both lie within the domain of the arctangent and arccotangent functions. Therefore, the solutions are valid.

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}.

"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines, we start by identifying the direction vectors of the lines and a vector connecting a point on each line.

The direction vector of the first line is:
\[
\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The direction vector of the second line is:
\[
\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
We observe that \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1}\), confirming that the lines are parallel.

Next, we take a point on the first line, \(\mathbf{r_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), and a point on the second line, \(\mathbf{r_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these two points is:
\[
\mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines is given by the formula:
\[
D = \frac{|\mathbf{a} \cdot (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c})|}{|\mathbf{b}|}
\]
where \(\mathbf{a} = \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}\), \(\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{d_1}\), and \(\mathbf{c} = \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}\):
\[
\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}\):
\[
|\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

Finally, we compute the distance:
\[
D = \frac{|\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{r_2} - \mathbf{r_1}|}{|\mathbf{d_1}|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{4 + 81 + 4}} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the given right triangle, we start by identifying the vertices of the triangle, which are \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), and \((-5,-4)\). The base of the triangle is along the x-axis from \((-5,0)\) to \((5,0)\), and the height is along the y-axis from \((0,-4)\) to \((0,4)\).

A point \((x,y)\) lies strictly inside the triangle if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. \(-5 < x < 5\)
2. \(-4 < y < 4\)
3. The point \((x,y)\) must also satisfy the equation of the hypotenuse, which is the line passing through \((5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\).

The equation of the line can be found using the two-point form of the equation of a line:
\[
y - y_1 = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}(x - x_1)
\]
Substituting \((x_1, y_1) = (5, 4)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (-5, -4)\), we get:
\[
y - 4 = \frac{-4 - 4}{-5 - 5}(x - 5) = \frac{-8}{-10}(x - 5) = \frac{4}{5}(x - 5)
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
y - 4 = \frac{4}{5}x - 4 \implies y = \frac{4}{5}x
\]
So, the equation of the hypotenuse is \(y = \frac{4}{5}x\).

For a point \((x,y)\) to lie strictly inside the triangle, it must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y < \frac{4}{5}x
\]

We will now count the integer points \((x,y)\) that satisfy these conditions. We will consider each integer value of \(x\) from \(-4\) to \(4\) (since \(y\) must be less than 4 and \(y < \frac{4}{5}x\) for \(x > 0\), and \(y\) must be greater than \(-4\) and \(y < \frac{4}{5}x\) for \(x < 0\)).

For \(x = 0\):
\[
-4 < y < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y < 0 \implies -4 < y < 0 \implies y = -3, -2, -1
\]
There are 3 points: \((0,-3)\), \((0,-2)\), \((0,-1)\).

For \(x = \pm 1\):
\[
-4 < y < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y < \frac{4}{5} \implies y < 0.8 \implies y = -3, -2, -1, 0
\]
There are 4 points for each \(x = 1\) and \(x = -1\), so there are \(4 + 4 = 8\) points.

For \(x = \pm 2\):
\[
-4 < y < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y < \frac{8}{5} \implies y < 1.6 \implies y = -3, -2, -1, 0
\]
There are 4 points for each \(x = 2\) and \(x = -2\), so there are \(4 + 4 = 8\) points.

For \(x = \pm 3\):
\[
-4 < y < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y < \frac{12}{5} \implies y < 2.4 \implies y = -3, -2, -1, 0
\]
There are 4 points for each \(x = 3\) and \(x = -3\), so there are \(4 + 4 = 8\) points.

For \(x = \pm 4\):
\[
-4 < y < 4 \quad \text{and} \quad y < \frac{16}{5} \implies y < 3.2 \implies y = -3, -2, -1, 0
\]
There are 4 points for each \(x = 4\) and \(x = -4\), so there are \(4 + 4 = 8\) points.

Adding up all the points, we get:
\[
3 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 35

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these, we can substitute the values into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"To determine the average price of Juan's stamps in the 70s, we need to calculate the total number of stamps and the total cost of these stamps, and then divide the total cost by the total number of stamps.

First, let's find the total number of stamps in the 70s:
- Brazil: 6 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 12 stamps
- Spain: 6 stamps

Adding these together, we get:
\[ 6 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 36 \text{ stamps} \]

Next, let's find the total cost of these stamps:
- Brazil: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 36 \text{ cents}\)
- France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents/stamp} = 48 \text{ cents}\)

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapez with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

Next, we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
dc = ab
\]

We also know that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (AD + BC) \cdot h
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(h = CD = c\). Therefore, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot c
\]
We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot c = 42
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:
\[
(a + b) \cdot c = 84
\]

Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), which is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c\). To do this, we need to express \(a\) in terms of \(c\). From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{d}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Since \(d = \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}\) (from the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ACD\)), we substitute \(d\) in the equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
c \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = ab
\]
We already know that \(ab = dc\), so:
\[
c \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = dc
\]
Dividing both sides by \(c\) (assuming \(c \neq 0\)) gives:
\[
\sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = d
\]
Squaring both sides gives:
\[
a^2 + c^2 = d^2
\]
Since \(d = \sqrt{a^2 + c^2}\), we substitute \(d\) in the equation:
\[
a^2 + c^2 = a^2 + c^2
\]
This equation is true, but it doesn't provide new information. Instead, we use the equation \((a + b) \cdot c = 84\). We need to express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(c\):
\[
b = \frac{84}{c} - a
\]
Substituting \(b\) in the Angle Bisector Theorem:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + c^2}}{a} = \frac{\frac{84}{c} - a}{c}
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
c \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = a \left( \frac{84}{c} - a \right)
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side:
\[
c \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = \frac{84a}{c} - a^2
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(c\) gives:
\[
c^2 \sqrt{a^2 + c^2} = 84a - a^2 c
\]
This equation is complex, so we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c\). We know that:
\[
(a + b) \cdot c = 84
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot c = 42
\]
Since \(b = \frac{84}{c} - a\), we substitute \(b\) in the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \left( a + \frac{84}{c} - a \right) \cdot c = 42
\]
Simplifying inside the parentheses:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{84}{c} \cdot c = 42
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} \cdot 84 = 42
\]
This equation is true, so the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]
Since \(a = \frac{84}{c} - b\) and \(b = \frac{84}{c} - a\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21
\]
Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -19x = -9

"To find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation @, which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)

To simplify this, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = \frac{70 \times 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of chords in a circle. Specifically, two chords intersect if and only if the endpoints of one chord lie on opposite sides of the other chord.

Let's denote the circle by \(O\) and the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circumference of the circle. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to arrange the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the points are distinct and the order in which they are arranged matters, there are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange them. However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) around \(A\). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points on the circle is \(3! = 6\).

Next, we count the number of arrangements in which the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, this occurs if the points are in an alternating pattern. There are exactly 2 such patterns for any given arrangement of the points: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations). Since there are 6 total arrangements of the points, and 2 of these arrangements result in intersecting chords, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the sum of the areas of two circles with radii 1 and 2 is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the areas of the circles:
- The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
  \[
  \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
  \]
- The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
  \[
  \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
  \]
- The sum of the areas of the two circles is:
  \[
  \pi + 4\pi = 5\pi
  \]
- According to the problem, this sum is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, we can write:
  \[
  5\pi = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi
  \]
  Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
  \[
  5\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
  \]
  This equation is not consistent with the given problem, so let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the sum of the areas of the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, which is:
  \[
  5\pi = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
  \]
  This is a contradiction, so let's re-evaluate the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the sum of the areas of the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, which is:
  \[
  5\pi = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
  \]

Now, let's find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\). The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle subtended by the arc of the smaller circle that is part of the common chord of the two circles. The length of the common chord can be found using the formula for the length of a chord in a circle:
\[
\text{Length of the chord} = 2 \sqrt{r^2 - d^2}
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the circle and \(d\) is the perpendicular distance from the center to the chord. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the areas of the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle to find the angle \(\angle ADC\).

The angle \(\angle ADC\) is given by:
\[
\angle ADC = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{r_1}{r_2} \right)
\]
where \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) are the radii of the two circles. Substituting the given radii, we get:
\[
\angle ADC = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)
\]
Using a calculator, we find:
\[
\arctan \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \approx 26.565^\circ
\]
Therefore:
\[
\angle ADC \approx 2 \times 26.565^\circ = 53.13^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill a spherical reservoir, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical containers and the spherical reservoir and then find the ratio of the volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. The radius of the spherical reservoir is half of the diameter, so:
\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cm} \]
Substituting the radius into the volume formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The radius of the cylindrical container is 3 cm and the height is 8 cm, so:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill the spherical reservoir, we divide the volume of the spherical reservoir by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{36 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{36}{72} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since we cannot have half a cylindrical container, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need 1 cylindrical container to fill the spherical reservoir.

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\) for a positive value of \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.
3. Select the positive solution.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Cube both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

2. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move all terms to one side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

3. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

4. Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we select \(x = 66\).

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Similarly, for \( \triangle AMC \):
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 11^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 121 + CM^2.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( BM = CM \). Let \( BM = CM = x \). Then:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( AD = 10 \) and \( D \) lies on \( AM \). Therefore, \( MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\sin \angle BCD = \sin \angle CBD = \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \frac{3\theta}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} \implies \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD + CD}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} = \frac{BC}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} \implies \sin 3\theta = \cos \frac{3\theta}{2}.
\]
Using the identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \) and \( \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = 1 - 2 \sin^2 \frac{3\theta}{2} \), we can solve for \( \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \sin 3\theta = \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} \) implies \( \theta = 30^\circ \).

Therefore, \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \). In \( \triangle ABM \):
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Since \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \), \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCD = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle CBD = 60^\circ \). Thus, \( BD = x \) and \( CD = x \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
BC = \sqrt{BD^2 + CD^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + x^2} = x\sqrt{2}.
\]
Since \( BM = CM = x \), \( BC = 2x \). Therefore:
\[
2x = x\sqrt{2} \implies x = 0 \text{ (not possible)} \text{ or } x = 11\sqrt{3}.
\]
Thus, \( x = 11\sqrt{3} \) and:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + (11\sqrt{3})^2 = 121 + 363 = 484 \implies AB = 22.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), \( AC = 22 \). Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 22 + 22 + 22\sqrt{3} = 44 + 22\sqrt{3}.

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

1. **Identify the sum of the numbers:**
   The sum of the 27 numbers is \(3^7\). First, we calculate \(3^7\):
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]
   So, the sum of the 27 numbers is 2187.

2. **Determine the median:**
   The median of a set of 27 numbers is the 14th number in the ordered list. To find the median, we need to consider the properties of the numbers and their sum.

3. **Consider the minimum possible values for the first 13 numbers:**
   To maximize the 14th number, we should minimize the sum of the first 13 numbers. The smallest positive integers are 1, so we assume the first 13 numbers are all 1:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor this expression as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can rewrite \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12,\]
which expands to
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We know that \(xy + yz + zx = p\) and \(xyz = 4\), so the equation becomes
\[sp - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We can further factor \(x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y\) as
\[x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12.\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[sp - (sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = 12.\]
This is an identity, so it doesn't provide new information. However, we can use the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\) to find \(p\).

We need to find a consistent solution for \(s\) and \(p\). Let's test some possible values. If we assume \(s = 2\), then
\[-8 = 2(2^2 - 3p),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = 2(4 - 3p),\]
or
\[-8 = 8 - 6p,\]
or
\[-16 = -6p,\]
or
\[p = \frac{8}{3}.\]

We need to verify that \(s = 2\) and \(p = \frac{8}{3}\) satisfy the original equations. If \(s = 2\) and \(p = \frac{8}{3}\), then
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = 4 - \frac{16}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{16}{3} = -\frac{4}{3},\]
which is not possible since \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) must be non-negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Let's try another approach. If we assume \(s = 2\), then
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p = 4 - 2 \cdot \frac{8}{3} = 4 - \frac{16}{3} = \frac{12}{3} - \frac{16}{3} = -\frac{4}{3},\]

   - Female tourists: \(8.6\%\)
   - Ratio of male to female tourists: \(\frac{11.6}{8.6} \approx 1.3586\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.

Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\).

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.

   The expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\).
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.

   The expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**

   The expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\).
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.

   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(RS = 2\), we get:

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

"To find the shortest distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by using the distance formula between a point \((x_1, y_1)\) and the origin \((0,0)\), which is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]

For a point \((x, y)\) on the curve, we substitute \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \(d\), we minimize \(d^2\):

\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \(u = x^2\). Then the function becomes:

\[
f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(f(u)\), take the derivative and set it to zero:

\[
f'(u) = u - 2
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
u - 2 = 0 \implies u = 2
\]

Substitute \(u = 2\) back into \(f(u)\):

\[
f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \(d^2\) is \(\frac{1}{2}\), so the minimum value of \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 2\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = 2 + 2 = 4\).

\boxed{4}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the geometry of the octahedron and the given distances to the other vertices.

A regular octahedron has 8 equilateral triangle faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is connected by an edge, and the vertices in each pair are opposite to each other. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, \( B \) and \( E \) are opposite, and \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite.

Given distances from \( P \) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Since \( P \) is equidistant from opposite vertices, the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices must be the same. Therefore, the distances from \( P \) to the remaining two vertices \( C \) and \( D \) must be the same, and they must be the only distances left that are not repeated.

The possible distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and the two unknown distances. Since the distances must be distinct and the octahedron is regular, the two unknown distances must be the two remaining distances from the set. The only way to pair the distances such that the sum of the distances from a vertex to its opposite vertex is the same for all pairs is to pair the smallest and largest distances with the next smallest and next largest distances, and so on.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, the only way to pair them such that the sum of the distances from a vertex to its opposite vertex is the same is to pair 3 with 11, 7 with 9, and 8 with itself. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( C \) (or \( D \)) is 8.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To determine the ratio of the speed of Jen's softball to the speed of Jack's baseball, we start with the given information that the force applied by both players is the same. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force \( F \) is equal to the mass \( m \) of the object multiplied by its acceleration \( a \), or \( F = ma \).

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both players, we can write:
\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Given that the mass of the softball \( m_{\text{softball}} \) is 200 g and the mass of the baseball \( m_{\text{baseball}} \) is 150 g, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Substituting the masses into the equation, we get:
\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the speed of Jen's softball to the speed of Jack's baseball, we need to consider that the speed is the same as the speed of the object, which is the same as the speed of the object's acceleration. Since the force is the same, the acceleration is inversely proportional to the mass. Therefore, the speed of the object is directly proportional to the mass of the object.

Thus, the ratio of the speed of Jen's softball to the speed of Jack's baseball is the same as the ratio of the mass of the baseball to the mass of the softball:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{m_{\text{baseball}}}{m_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine how many identical numbers are present in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

However, each rokovanj involves two participants, so we need to divide this total by 2 to avoid double-counting.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is equal to \( f(x-1) \), we can use a property of polynomials. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( f(1) \) and then use the fact that the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the coefficients of \( f(x-1) \), which is \( f(1) \).

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) respectively:

\[

This is a contradiction, so we need to use another approach. We can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials with complex coefficients. Let's assume:
\[
x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.
\]
By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial, we get the system of equations:
\[
a + c = 2,
\]
\[
ac + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + bc = 0,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]
We can solve this system step by step. From the first equation, we have \(c = 2 - a\). Substituting this into the other equations, we get:
\[
a(2-a) + b + d = 0 \implies 2a - a^2 + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + b(2-a) = 0 \implies ad + 2b - ab = 0 \implies b(2-a) = -ad \implies b = \frac{-ad}{2-a},
\]
\[
bd = 2 \implies \left(\frac{-ad}{2-a}\right)d = 2 \implies \frac{-ad^2}{2-a} = 2 \implies -ad^2 = 2(2-a) \implies -ad^2 = 4 - 2a \implies ad^2 = 2a - 4 \implies d^2 = 2 - \frac{4}{a}.
\]
We can choose \(a = 1 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(c = 1 - \sqrt{3}\). Then:
\[
b = \frac{-d(1 + \sqrt{3})}{2 - (1 + \sqrt{3})} = \frac{-d(1 + \sqrt{3})}{1 - \sqrt{3}} = \frac{-d(1 + \sqrt{3})(1 + \sqrt{3})}{(1 - \sqrt{3})(1 + \sqrt{3})} = \frac{-d(1 + 2\sqrt{3} + 3)}{1 - 3} = \frac{-d(4 + 2\sqrt{3})}{-2} = d(2 + \sqrt{3}),
\]
\[
d^2 = 2 - \frac{4}{1 + \sqrt{3}} = 2 - \frac{4(1 - \sqrt{3})}{(1 + \sqrt{3})(1 - \sqrt{3})} = 2 - \frac{4(1 - \sqrt{3})}{1 - 3} = 2 - \frac{4(1 - \sqrt{3})}{-2} = 2 + 2(1 - \sqrt{3}) = 4 - 2\sqrt{3},

\[
d = \sqrt{4 - 2\sqrt{3}} = \sqrt{(\sqrt{3} - 1)^2} = \sqrt{3} - 1.

Then:
\[
b = (\sqrt{3} - 1)(2 + \sqrt{3}) = 2\sqrt{3} + 3 - 2 - \sqrt{3} = \sqrt{3} + 1.

So the factorization is:

The roots are:

\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137 \div 100}{500 \div 100} = \frac{1.37}{5}
\]

Next, we perform the division of 1.37 by 5:

\[
1.37 \div 5 = 0.274
\]

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The denominator in this decimal representation is 1000, because \(0.274 = \frac{274}{1000}\).

Now, we need to find the last non-zero digit of 1000. The number 1000 is composed of the digits 1, 0, 0, and 0. The last non-zero digit of 1000 is 1.

Therefore, the last non-zero digit of the denominator in the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\), so \(a = kb\) since \(AB/AD = k\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\). Therefore, the point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\) if:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
\]
\[
ax + by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0
\]
This is the equation of a line \(ax + by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} = 0\), and the region above this line is where the point is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\). Similarly, we can write the inequalities for the other vertices:
\[
bx + ay + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0 \quad \text{(closer to \(B\))}
\]
\[
bx - ay + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0 \quad \text{(closer to \(C\))}
\]
\[
bx + ay - \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} > 0 \quad \text{(closer to \(D\))}
\]

These four lines divide the rectangle into four regions, each of which is a right triangle with the center \(O\) as one of its vertices. Each of these triangles has an area equal to one-fourth of the area of the rectangle. Therefore, the total area of the region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the area of one of these triangles, which is one-fourth of the area of the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is \(2a \cdot 2b = 4ab\). The area of one of the triangles is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \cdot 4ab = ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the region closer to \(O\) to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 9 \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54
\]

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

\[
r = a - bq = 54 - 54 = 0

Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total and how much money remains after they collectively spend all their money, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they have together.
2. Determine how much money they spend in total.
3. Calculate the remaining money after spending.
4. Convert the remaining money from dollars to cents.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money they have together.**

Linda: \$27.47
Sherry: \$35.23
June: \$37.37
Connie: \$26.52

Total amount = \$27.47 + \$35.23 + \$37.37 + \$26.52

First, add \$27.47 and \$35.23:
\$27.47 + \$35.23 = \$62.70

Next, add \$62.70 and \$37.37:
\$62.70 + \$37.37 = \$100.07

Finally, add \$100.07 and \$26.52:
\$100.07 + \$26.52 = \$126.59

So, the total amount of money they have together is \$126.59.

**Step 2: Determine how much money they spend in total.**

Since they spend all their money, the total amount spent is \$126.59.

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining money after spending.**

Since they spend all their money, the remaining money is \$0.

**Step 4: Convert the remaining money from dollars to cents.**

There are 100 cents in a dollar, so \$0 is equal to 0 cents.

Therefore, the remaining money is \(\boxed{0}\) cents.","[0, '0']",59,"[59, '59']",False
"To find the arithmetic mean (average) of the test scores for the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the test scores and then divide that sum by the number of students in the class.

Here are the steps:

1. Determine the total score for the students who scored 80. There are 20 students who scored 80, so the total score for these students is:
   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600
   \]

2. Determine the total score for the students who scored 90. There are 8 students who scored 90, so the total score for these students is:
   \[
   8 \times 90 = 720

"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given magic square is valid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \). Let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the square to be magic, this sum must also be equal to \( 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify this value of \( n \) by substituting \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and checking the sums of the columns and the diagonals:

The magic square becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\

Let's check the sum of the numbers in the first column:

\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the numbers in the second column:

\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the numbers in the third column:

\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15

Let's check the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal:

\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal:

\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer steps Jim takes compared to Martha, we need to calculate the number of steps each person takes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of steps Jim takes. Jim hodi diagonalno čez polje, which means he moves in a straight line from one corner of the rectangle to the opposite corner. The number of steps Jim takes is equal to the sum of the width and the height of the rectangle, because each step is one cell in either direction.

The width of the polynomial is 300 cells, and the height is 400 cells. Therefore, the number of steps Jim takes is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the longest distance that can be traveled by starting at any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the perimeter of each triangle formed by these points. The longest perimeter will be the answer.

First, let's list the side lengths of each triangle:
- For triangle \( ABD \):
  - \( AB = 5 \)
  - \( BD = 5 \)
  - \( AD = 3 \)
  The perimeter is \( AB + BD + AD = 5 + 5 + 3 = 13 \).

- For triangle \( ABC \):
  - \( AB = 5 \)
  - \( BC = 6 \)
  - \( AC = 6 \)
  The perimeter is \( AB + BC + AC = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17 \).

- For triangle \( ACD \):
  - \( AC = 6 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - \( AD = 3 \)

- For triangle \( BCD \):
  - \( BC = 6 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - \( BD = 5 \)
