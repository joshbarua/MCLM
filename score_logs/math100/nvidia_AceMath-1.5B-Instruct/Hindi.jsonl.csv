"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the length \(EF\) is simply the difference in the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), which is 7 units. This confirms that the y-coordinate of \(E\) is correct.

Next, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in a coordinate plane is given by the distance formula:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\), we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   The complex number \( z \) is \( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and the complex number \( c \) is \( 2 - 3i \). To translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin, we subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we multiply it by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \):
   \[
   \left(\sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right)
   \]
   We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method) to expand this product:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i\right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1, \quad \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = i, \quad (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})i = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3i, \quad (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2 = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2})(-1) = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3
   \]
   Combine all the terms:
   \[
   1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 = \left(1 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3\right) + \left(1 - 3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i = \left(4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:
   \[
   \left(4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i + (2 - 3i) = \left(4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 2\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\right)i = \left(6 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-5 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

6. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 logicians around a circular table such that Pierre, Rose, and Tom are all sitting next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rose, and Tom as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rose, and Tom must sit next to each other, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rose-Tom block and the other 5 logicians) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rose, and Tom within their block**: Within their block, Pierre, Rose, and Tom can be arranged in any order. There are \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange 3 people, which is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rose, and Tom within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 logicians around a circular table such that Pierre, Rose, and Tom are all sitting next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 2 + 7k \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, we have:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 7k + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 7k + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 7k + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product of these remainders modulo 7:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

Now, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,
\]

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to look like its original position, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \) and still look the same.

The angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \). Calculating this, we get:

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \((6, \frac{7}{2})\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:

Since \(x > 7\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) is not on the same side of the parallelogram as the other vertices, but rather on the opposite side. Therefore, the correct midpoint calculation should be:

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote.

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the values of \( n \) and \( m \):
- If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
- If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
- If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In our function, the degree of the numerator \( P(x) = 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the value of \( a + b + c \):

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we need to understand the properties of exponentiation involving the number 1. Specifically, we need to know that any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1. This property can be expressed as follows:

\[1^x = 1 \quad \text{for any } x \neq 0\]

In this problem, the exponent \(2^{235423523}\) is a very large number, but it is not zero. Therefore, we can apply the property of exponentiation that states any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9

To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]

So, \(36\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent of \(x\), so we can write:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"Let's denote the weight of a tree as \( T \), the weight of a square as \( S \), and the weight of a goldfish as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. The weight of 10 trees is equal to the weight of 3 squares and 1 goldfish:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]

2. The weight of 2 trees and 1 goldfish is equal to the weight of 1 square:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the weight of 1 tree in terms of the weight of a square, \( S \). To do this, we will solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate terms involving \( T \) on one side:
\[
12T = 4S
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( T \):
\[
T = S

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank. The rate at which the volume of water is increasing is given as \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the rate at which the height of the water is increasing is given as 4 meters per hour. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Using the volume formula, we differentiate both sides with respect to time \( t \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects a horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a = 0\), the function is \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \geq 0\), which is a horizontal line.

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\).

To find the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects a horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) and the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) intersect or touch each other.

First, let's check the intersection at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a^3 \quad \text{(from the parabola)} \]
\[ f(a) = a^2 + 2a \quad \text{(from the line)} \]
For these to be equal, we need:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]
Since \(a = 0\) corresponds to a horizontal line, which does not intersect the graph of \(y = f(x)\) at least once, we discard it. The other solutions are \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\).

To determine which of these values is the largest, we note that \(a = 2\) is greater than \(a = -1\). Therefore, the largest possible value of \(a\) is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2). \]

We need this to equal \(x\), so we set up the equation:

\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0. \]

This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

For the first case, \(x = 0\), we have \(f(0) = 0\), so \(f(f(0)) = 0\). This satisfies the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) but does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).

For the second case, we need to solve:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + 2\lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1. \]

We need to check if this polynomial has a root in \((0,1)\). We can use the Intermediate Value Theorem. Evaluate the polynomial at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\):

\[ f(0) = -3, \]
\[ f(1) = 16 - 16 + 12 - 3 = 5. \]

Since \(f(0) = -3\) and \(f(1) = 5\), there is a root in the interval \((0,1)\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution.

For \(\lambda = 4\):

\[ 4^4 x^3 - 2 \cdot 4^3 x^2 + (4^3 + 4^2)x + (1 - 4^2) = 256x^3 - 128x^2 + 80x - 15. \]

We need to check if this polynomial has a root in \((0,1)\). Evaluate the polynomial at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\):

\[ f(0) = -15, \]
\[ f(1) = 256 - 128 + 80 - 15 = 193. \]

Since \(f(0) = -15\) and \(f(1) = 193\), there is a root in the interval \((0,1)\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 4\) is a solution.

For \(\lambda = 3\):

\[ 3^4 x^3 - 2 \cdot 3^3 x^2 + (3^3 + 3^2)x + (1 - 3^2) = 81x^3 - 54x^2 + 30x - 8. \]

We need to check if this polynomial has a root in \((0,1)\). Evaluate the polynomial at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\):

\[ f(0) = -8, \]
\[ f(1) = 81 - 54 + 30 - 8 = 49. \]

Since \(f(0) = -8\) and \(f(1) = 49\), there is a root in the interval \((0,1)\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 3\) is a solution.

For \(\lambda = 1\):

\[ 1^4 x^3 - 2 \cdot 1^3 x^2 + (1^3 + 1^2)x + (1 - 1^2) = x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x. \]

\[ f(1) = 1 - 2 + 2 = 1. \]

Since \(f(0) = 0\) and \(f(1) = 1\), there is no root in the interval \((0,1)\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 1\) is not a solution.

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression. The given expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ + \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can further simplify this by using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) again. Let \(x = 25^\circ\). Then \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator as:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,

\[
\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 35^\circ.

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 35^\circ} = \tan 35^\circ.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 0 \) to maximize \( f(1, y) = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), which is maximized when \( y = 0 \). Similarly, if \( y = 1 \), then \( x = 0 \) to maximize \( f(x, 1) = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), which is maximized when \( x = 0 \). Therefore, one candidate for the maximum value is \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Substituting \( y = x \) into the function, we get:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ 2(1 - 2x^2) = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into the function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 1. \]
Thus, the value of \( f(x, y) \) at \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \) is 1.

From the above analysis, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1, which occurs at the points \( (1, 0) \), \( (0, 1) \), and \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \).

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) divided by 2. The area is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\|
\]

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The vectors are:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Now, we can find the area of the triangle:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta.
\]

Equating this to the given expression, we get:

\[
2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Solving for \( \cos \theta \), we find:

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[
z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}.
\]

Thus,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta.
\]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[
4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0.
\]

The roots of this equation are:

\[
x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}.
\]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The corresponding angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \frac{7\pi}{10} \). For \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \), we have:

\[
85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{10} = \frac{255\pi}{10} = 25\pi + \frac{5\pi}{10} = 25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

Since \( \cos(25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos(\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos \frac{3\pi}{2} = 0 \), we have:

\[
\cos 85\theta = 0.
\]

Therefore,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 0 = 0.

"To find the area of triangle \(MNC\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the centroid to the base, which is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64

The area of triangle \(MNC\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\):

- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,

We are given the 4th term \(a_4 = 200\) and the 8th term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of six randomly chosen distinct prime numbers is even, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers. Specifically, we need to know whether these prime numbers are odd or even.

The only even prime number is 2. All other prime numbers are odd. Therefore, if we choose six distinct prime numbers, there are two scenarios to consider:
1. The number 2 is included in the selection.
2. The number 2 is not included in the selection.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to choose six distinct prime numbers.**

There are infinitely many prime numbers, but for the purpose of this problem, we only need to consider the parity (odd or even) of the sum. We can break this down into two cases based on whether 2 is included or not.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to choose six distinct prime numbers such that their sum is even.**

- **Case 1: The number 2 is included.**

  If 2 is included, the sum of the remaining five prime numbers must be even for the total sum to be even. The sum of five numbers is even if and only if an even number of these five numbers are odd. Since there are infinitely many odd primes, we can choose 0, 2, 4, or 5 odd primes from the remaining five primes. However, the number of ways to choose an even number of odd primes from five primes is exactly half of the total number of ways to choose five primes (because the number of ways to choose an even number of odd primes is equal to the number of ways to choose an odd number of odd primes).

  Therefore, there are \(2^5 = 32\) ways to choose five primes, and half of these ways will result in an even sum. So, there are \(16\) ways to choose five primes such that their sum is even.

  Since we can choose 2 in any of the six positions, the total number of ways to choose six primes such that their sum is even is \(6 \times 16 = 96\).

- **Case 2: The number 2 is not included.**

  If 2 is not included, the sum of the six prime numbers must be even for the total sum to be even. The sum of six numbers is even if and only if an even number of these six numbers are odd. Since there are infinitely many odd primes, we can choose 0, 2, 4, or 6 odd primes from the six primes. However, the number of ways to choose an even number of odd primes from six primes is exactly half of the total number of ways to choose six primes (because the number of ways to choose an even number of odd primes is equal to the number of ways to choose an odd number of odd primes).

  Therefore, there are \(2^6 = 64\) ways to choose six primes, and half of these ways will result in an even sum. So, there are \(32\) ways to choose six primes such that their sum is even.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of ways to choose six distinct prime numbers.**

The total number of ways to choose six distinct prime numbers is the sum of the number of ways to choose six primes such that their sum is even and the number of ways to choose six primes such that their sum is odd. From the above, we have:
- Number of ways to choose six primes such that their sum is even: \(96 + 32 = 128\)
- Number of ways to choose six primes such that their sum is odd: \(64\)

Therefore, the total number of ways to choose six distinct prime numbers is \(128 + 64 = 192\).

**Step 4: Calculate the probability.**

The probability that the sum of six randomly chosen distinct prime numbers is even is the ratio of the number of ways to choose six primes such that their sum is even to the total number of ways to choose six primes:
\[
\frac{128}{192} = \frac{2}{3}

Next, we need to check if there is a number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1 that is divisible by \(3^2 = 9\) and \(5^2 = 25\). Since the number must end in 0, it must be divisible by 25. The smallest number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1 that ends in 0 and is divisible by 25 is 100000. However, 100000 is not divisible by 9. The next number to check is 1111110, but it is not divisible by 9 either. We continue this process until we find a number that meets all the criteria.

The number

"To determine the probability that the checkered square is the one where the shaded square intersects the diagonal of the chessboard, we need to analyze the process of filling the chessboard and the possible outcomes.

1. **Understanding the Process:**
   - The chessboard is filled by first dividing each row by 4 and then dividing each column by 5.
   - This results in a grid of \(4 \times 5 = 20\) smaller squares in each row and each column.
   - Each smaller square in a row is shaded if it corresponds to a remainder of 1, 2, or 3 when divided by 4.

   - In each column, the shaded squares are in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27 (but since there are only 4 rows, the valid rows are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, and 27).

3. **Finding the Intersection:**

   - The intersection square is the square in the \(i\)-th row and \(j\)-th column where \(i \equiv 1, 2, 3 \pmod{4}\) and \(j \equiv 1, 2, 3, 4 \pmod{5}\).

"To find the sum of the digits of the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\). The product \(\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ\) can be simplified using the product-to-sum identities, but a more straightforward approach is to use known results from trigonometric products. It is known that:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

"To determine the shape represented by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation means in Cartesian coordinates. The cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) are related to the Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) by the following transformations:
\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

Given the equation \( z = c \), it means that the value of \( z \) is constant and does not depend on the values of \( x \) or \( y \). In Cartesian coordinates, this equation represents a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and located at a height \( c \) above the \( xy \)-plane.

In cylindrical coordinates, the equation \( z = c \) remains unchanged because \( z \) is the same in both coordinate systems. Therefore, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and located at a height \( c \) above the \( xy \)-plane.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) and is the smallest possible angle is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote these roots by \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49.
\]

Now, we need to find the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). If \( s \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( g(s) = 0 \), which means \( f(s+5) = 0 \). Therefore, \( s+5 \) must be one of the roots of \( f(x) \). Let's denote the roots of \( f(x) \) by \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( s_1 = r_1 - 5 \), \( s_2 = r_2 - 5 \), and \( s_3 = r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
s_1 + s_2 + s_3 = (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34.

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This gives us:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) again to rewrite the expression in terms of sine:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]
So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). We need to find a way to simplify the expression. We can use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The identity states that:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ - x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ + x)} = \frac{27}{\sin^2 3x}.
\]
For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 50^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 70^\circ} = \frac{27}{\sin^2 30^\circ} = \frac{27}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = 108.
\]
However, we need the sum \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Using the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\), we can use the same identity for the angles \(20^\circ\), \(40^\circ\), and \(80^\circ\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = \frac{27}{\sin^2 60^\circ} = \frac{27}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{27}{\frac{3}{4}} = 36.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:

\[

\]

where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon. We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

First, we expand the left side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23}. \]
Now, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]

\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]

\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]

Since \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\), we have \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \theta\).

Therefore, the original equation becomes:
\[
\sin \left( \theta + \theta \right) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2 \implies x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

We need to check if these solutions are valid by ensuring they satisfy the domain of the original functions. Both \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are positive, so they are valid.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|}.
\]

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = 31 \mathbf{i} - 6 \mathbf{j} + 58 \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Now, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) inside the square with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to count all the points \((x,y)\) such that \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-5 < y < 5\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we get

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

"To determine the average cost of a ticket in the 70s, we need to calculate the total cost of all the tickets sold in the 70s and then divide that by the number of tickets sold.

First, let's identify the number of tickets sold and their respective costs:
- In the 1970s, 12 tickets were sold for $12 each.
- In the 1980s, 15 tickets were sold for $15 each.
- In the 1990s, 10 tickets were sold for $9 each.

Next, we calculate the total cost for each decade:
- Total cost for the 1970s: \(12 \times 12 = 144\) dollars
- Total cost for the 1980s: \(15 \times 15 = 225\) dollars
- Total cost for the 1990s: \(10 \times 9 = 90\) dollars

Now, we sum these total costs to find the overall total cost:
\[144 + 225 + 90 = 459\] dollars

Next, we find the total number of tickets sold:
\[12 + 15 + 10 = 37\] tickets

Finally, we calculate the average cost per ticket by dividing the total cost by the total number of tickets:
\[\text{Average cost per ticket} = \frac{459}{37} \approx 12.1351\]

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{AD}{CD} \implies \frac{d}{b} = \frac{a}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
\]
where \(h\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) is equal to \(CD = c\). Therefore, the area can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42 \implies (a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

To find \(a \times c\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) when \(\overline{CD}\) is the base. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is also the height of the trapezoid, we can use the relationship between the sides and the height to find \(a \times c\).

From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{d}{b} = \frac{a}{c} \implies d = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

However, we don't need \(d\) to find \(a \times c\). We already know that:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

To find \(a \times c\), we need to express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of the trapezoid, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h_1
\]
where \(h_1\) is the height from \(B\) to \(AC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of the trapezoid, \(h_1 = c\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

Since the total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b + a) \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times (2a + b) \times c
\]

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (2a + b) \times c = 42 \implies (2a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Since \(b = \frac{ac}{a}\), we substitute \(b\) in the equation:
\[
(2a + \frac{ac}{a}) \times c = 84 \implies (2a + c) \times c = 84
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times 21 = 21

\[

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \( 21 \) and \( 30 \) is \( 3 \), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( 3 \):

Let's denote the points on the circle as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a clockwise order. For the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, we fix one point, say \(A\), and consider the possible positions of the other three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(B\) can be in any of the remaining 3 positions. Once \(B\) is fixed, the point \(C\) can be in any of the remaining 2 positions. Finally, the point \(D\) must be in the only remaining position.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. Therefore, the area of the larger circle is:
   \[
   \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:

   \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

3. **Identify the components of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. The larger segment is part of the outer circle, and the smaller segment is part of the inner circle. The area of the larger segment is the area of the sector of the outer circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\), and the area of the smaller segment is the area of the sector of the inner circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\).

4. **Calculate the area of the triangle \(ADC\):**
   The triangle \(ADC\) is a right triangle with \(AD\) as the height and \(DC\) as the base. Since \(D\) is the center of the circles, \(AD = 1\) and \(DC = 2\). Therefore, the area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:

   The area of the sector of the inner circle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the inner circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}

   The area of the segment of the inner circle is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the segment of the inner circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - 1

   The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments of the outer and inner circles:

\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical barrels are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical barrel:
\[ \text{Number of barrels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{36 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{36}{72} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Since we cannot have half a barrel, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need 1 cylindrical barrel to fill the spherical tank.

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a synthetic society of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that each party must be represented by at least one member, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a committee of 5 members without any restrictions:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \).
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not include any Republicans:**
   This is equivalent to choosing 5 members from the 6 Democrats.
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not include any Democrats:**
   This is equivalent to choosing 5 members from the 8 Republicans.
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not include any members from either party:**
   Since there are no members left to choose from, this is not possible.
   \[
   \binom{0}{5} = 0
   \]

5. **Use the principle of inclusion and exclusion to find the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not include at least one member from each party:**
   The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not include at least one member from each party is the sum of the number of ways to form a committee without Republicans and the number of ways to form a committee without Democrats, minus the number of ways to form a committee without any members from either party.
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} + \binom{8}{5} - \binom{0}{5} = 6 + 56 - 0 = 62

6. **Subtract the number of ways to form a committee that does not include at least one member from each party from the total number of ways to form a committee:**
   The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - 62 = 2002 - 62 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:

"Let the three consecutive integers be \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\). According to the problem, the product of these three integers is 120, and the product divided by their average is 24. We can express these conditions as follows:

1. \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\)
2. \(\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3}} = 24\)

First, simplify the second condition. The sum of the three integers is \(x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x + 3\), so the average is \(\frac{3x+3}{3} = x+1\). Therefore, the second condition becomes:

\[
\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24
\]

Since \(x+1 \neq 0\) (because \(x\) is an integer and \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\)), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
x(x+2) = 24
\]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[
x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0
\]

We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring:

\[
(x+6)(x-4) = 0
\]

So, the solutions are \(x = -6\) or \(x = 4\). We now check which of these solutions satisfies the first condition \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\):

1. If \(x = 4\), then \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120\).
2. If \(x = -6\), then \(x(x+1)(x+2) = -6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120\).

Since the second solution does not satisfy the first condition, we discard \(x = -6\). Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\).

The largest of these three integers is \(6\). Thus, the answer is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:

   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:

   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:

   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}

   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so \(16x = \frac{16\pi}{15}\). Therefore, we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle AMB \), we can find \( BM \):
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \implies AB = \frac{11}{\sin \theta}
\]
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{\frac{11}{\sin \theta}} \implies BM = \frac{11 \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
\]
Since \( BC = 2BM \), we have:
\[
BC = \frac{22 \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}
\]

Next, we use the right triangle \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( AD = 10 \), \( BD = AB - AD = \frac{11}{\sin \theta} - 10 \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = \frac{CD}{BC} = \frac{CD}{\frac{22 \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}} \implies CD = \frac{22 \cos \theta \sin 3\theta}{\sin \theta}
\]
\[
\cos 3\theta = \frac{BD}{BC} = \frac{\frac{11}{\sin \theta} - 10}{\frac{22 \cos \theta}{\sin \theta}} \implies \cos 3\theta = \frac{11 - 10 \sin \theta}{22 \cos \theta}
\]

Using the triple angle identity for sine, \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \), we substitute:
\[
\sin 3\theta = \frac{11 - 10 \sin \theta}{22 \cos \theta} \implies 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta = \frac{11 - 10 \sin \theta}{22 \cos \theta}

Using the Pythagorean identity, \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} \), we substitute:
\[
3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta = \frac{11 - 10 \sin \theta}{22 \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta}}
\]

By trial and error or solving the equation, we find that \( \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \). Therefore, \( \theta = 30^\circ \).

Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \) back, we get:
\[
AB = \frac{11}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{11}{\frac{1}{2}} = 22

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So, the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

\[

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).

Substituting this into the equation, we have:

Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

   - Number of female bus trips: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio of male to female bus trips: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5000\)

- The ratio for the 10th grade is approximately 1.0394, which is less than 1.35.
- The ratio for the 11th grade is exactly 1.5000, which is greater than 1.35.
- The ratio for the 12th grade is approximately 1.3514, which is slightly greater than 1.35.

The ratio for the 12th grade is the closest to 1.35. Therefore, the grade with the number of male bus trips closest to 135% of the number of female bus trips is the \(\boxed{12}\)th grade.","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\).
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\).
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\).
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]
In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To find the area of the largest possible rectangular area that can be enclosed by the track, we need to consider the shape of the track and the dimensions of the rectangle. The track consists of a straight segment of 400 meters and two semicircles at the ends. The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle.

Let's denote the width of the rectangle by \( w \) meters. Since the diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle, the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \) meters.

The length of the straight segment of the track is 400 meters, which is the same as the length of the rectangle. Therefore, the length of the rectangle is 400 meters.

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 400 \times w \]

To maximize the area, we need to maximize the width \( w \). The width \( w \) is limited by the total length of the track. The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight segments and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the two semicircles together form a full circle, the total length of the track is:
\[ \text{Total length} = 400 + 2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = 400 + \pi w \]

We need to find the maximum value of \( w \) such that the total length of the track is less than or equal to the given total length. However, since the problem does not provide a specific total length for the track, we assume that the width \( w \) is maximized when the semicircles are as large as possible, which means the width \( w \) is maximized when the semicircles are as large as possible.

Given that the problem does not provide a specific total length for the track, we assume that the width \( w \) is maximized when the semicircles are as large as possible, which means the width \( w \) is maximized when the semicircles are as large as possible.

Therefore, the area of the largest possible rectangle is:
\[ A = 400 \times 200 = 80000 \]

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with a right angle at \(T\), and \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\), then the length of the adjacent side \(RT\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
RT = \sqrt{RS^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}

Now, we need to find \(\sin T\). For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin T = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2k}{5k} = \frac{2}{5}

"To find the shortest distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by using the distance formula between a point \((x_1, y_1)\) and the origin \((0,0)\), which is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + y_1^2}
\]

Since the point \((x_1, y_1)\) lies on the curve, we substitute \(y_1\) with \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x_1^2 - 3)\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x_1^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x_1^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x_1^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x_1^2 - 3)^2 = x_1^4 - 6x_1^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x_1^4 - 6x_1^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x_1^2 + \frac{1}{2}x_1^4 - 3x_1^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x_1^4 - 2x_1^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \(d\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x_1\):

\[
f(x_1) = \frac{1}{2}x_1^4 - 2x_1^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Take the derivative of \(f(x_1)\) with respect to \(x_1\):

\[
f'(x_1) = 2x_1^3 - 4x_1
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x_1^3 - 4x_1 = 0
\]

Factor out \(2x_1\):

\[
2x_1(x_1^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \(x_1\):

\[
x_1 = 0, \quad x_1 = \sqrt{2}, \quad x_1 = -\sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluate \(f(x_1)\) at these critical points:

1. For \(x_1 = 0\):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \(x_1 = \sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \(x_1 = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x_1)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not a perfect square and does not have any other perfect square factor other than 1, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   -3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 3 = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0 \neq 6
   \]
   Testing \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6
   \]
   Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"Given that the distances from point \( P \) to the first five vertices of a regular tetrahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's denote the vertices of the tetrahedron as \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \). The distances from \( P \) to these vertices are given as follows:
\[ PA = 3, \quad PB = 7, \quad PC = 8, \quad PD = 9, \quad PE = 11. \]
We need to find the distance \( PF \).

The key property of a regular tetrahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant. This property can be expressed as:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant}. \]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[ PA^2 = 3^2 = 9, \]
\[ PB^2 = 7^2 = 49, \]
\[ PC^2 = 8^2 = 64, \]
\[ PD^2 = 9^2 = 81, \]
\[ PE^2 = 11^2 = 121. \]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is constant, we can write:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 324 + PF^2. \]

To find \( PF^2 \), we need to know the constant sum of the squares of the distances. However, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the centroid. For a regular tetrahedron, the centroid is equidistant from all vertices, so the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices is a constant.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices is a constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant to find \( PF^2 \).

Therefore, we have:
\[ PF^2 = 324 - 324 = 0. \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ PF = 0. \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( F \) is:

"To determine the ratio of the tugging force on the ball of the jockeys to the tugging force on the ball of the softboarder, we need to use the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration (F = ma).

Let's denote the tugging force on the softboarder's ball as \( F_s \) and the tugging force on the jockeys' ball as \( F_j \). The acceleration of both balls is the same because they are being pulled by the same force and are moving in the same direction. Let's call this acceleration \( a \).

\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) - \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This identity is satisfied, confirming our roots are correct.

Next, we use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as:
\[
x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.
\]
By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\), we obtain:
\[
a + c = 2,
\]
\[
ac + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + bc = 0,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]

We can solve these equations step by step. From \(bd = 2\), we can express \(d\) as \(d = \frac{2}{b}\). Substituting \(d\) into the other equations, we get:
\[
ac + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0,
\]
\[
a\left(\frac{2}{b}\right) + bc = 0 \implies \frac{2a}{b} + bc = 0 \implies 2a + b^2c = 0 \implies c = -\frac{2a}{b^2}.
\]
Substituting \(c = -\frac{2a}{b^2}\) into \(a + c = 2\), we get:
\[
a - \frac{2a}{b^2} = 2 \implies a\left(1 - \frac{2}{b^2}\right) = 2 \implies a = \frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}.
\]
Substituting \(a = \frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\) and \(c = -\frac{2a}{b^2} = -\frac{2\left(\frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\right)}{b^2} = -\frac{4}{b^2 - 2}\) into \(ac + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0\), we get:
\[
\left(\frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\right)\left(-\frac{4}{b^2 - 2}\right) + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0 \implies -\frac{8b^2}{(b^2 - 2)^2} + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0.
\]
Multiplying through by \(b(b^2 - 2)^2\), we get:
\[
-8b^3 + b(b^2 - 2)^2 + 2(b^2 - 2)^2 = 0.
\]
This is a complex equation, so we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and can be found using numerical methods or known results. The roots are:
\[
\alpha_1 = \sqrt{2} - i, \quad \alpha_2 = \sqrt{2} + i, \quad \alpha_3 = -\sqrt{2} - i, \quad \alpha_4 = -\sqrt{2} + i.
\]
Now, we calculate the expressions \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\):
\[
S_1 = (\sqrt{2} - i)(\sqrt{2} + i) + (-\sqrt{2} - i)(-\sqrt{2} + i) = (2 + 1) + (2 + 1) = 6,
\]
\[
S_2 = (\sqrt{2} - i)(-\sqrt{2} - i) + (\sqrt{2} + i)(-\sqrt{2} + i) = (-2 - 1) + (-2 + 1) = -4,
\]
\[
S_3 = (\sqrt{2} - i)(-\sqrt{2} + i) + (\sqrt{2} + i)(-\sqrt{2} - i) = (-2 + 1) + (-2 - 1) = -4.
\]
Thus, the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one pen in cents, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( p \) be the cost of one pen in dollars and \( j \) be the cost of one jar in dollars. The problem provides us with the following two equations:

1. The cost of three pens and one jar is \$1.24:
   \[
   3p + j = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five pens and one jar is \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + j = 1.82
   \]

We can eliminate \( j \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + j) - (3p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
\[
2p = 0.58
\]
\[
p = 0.29
\]

Since \( p \) is the cost of one pen in dollars, we convert this to cents by multiplying by 100:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The rectangle has vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The center \(O\) is the midpoint of both the length and the width of the rectangle. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is the same, and it is equal to half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the region inside the circle with center \(O\) and radius equal to the distance from \(O\) to any vertex. This circle is inscribed in the rectangle and touches all four sides of the rectangle.

The area of the circle is given by:
\[
\pi r^2
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the circle. Since the radius \(r\) is equal to half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, we can express the area of the circle in terms of the dimensions of the rectangle. However, we can also use the fact that the area of the circle is a fraction of the area of the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle is:
\[
AB \times AD
\]
Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we can express \(AB\) as \(k \cdot AD\). Therefore, the area of the rectangle is:
\[
k \cdot AD \cdot AD = k \cdot AD^2
\]

The area of the circle is:
\[
\pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{(k \cdot AD)^2 + AD^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{k^2 \cdot AD^2 + AD^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{AD^2 (k^2 + 1)}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \left(\frac{AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \frac{AD^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{\pi \frac{AD^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4}}{k \cdot AD^2} = \frac{\pi (k^2 + 1)}{4k}

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14}{3} \approx 1.0467 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0467 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 \approx 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money each person has after buying the tickets and converting the tickets into notes, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money each person spent on tickets.
2. Subtract the amount spent from the amount they initially had (which is the amount they spent plus the amount they have left after buying the tickets).
3. Convert the remaining money into notes.

Let's start with each person:

**Lindha:**
- Amount spent: \$27.47
- Initial amount: \$27.47 (since the problem doesn't specify the initial amount, we assume it is the same as the amount spent)
- Remaining amount: \$27.47 - \$27.47 = \$0
- Since the remaining amount is \$0, it cannot be converted into notes.

**Sharia:**
- Amount spent: \$35.23
- Initial amount: \$35.23
- Remaining amount: \$35.23 - \$35.23 = \$0
- Since the remaining amount is \$0, it cannot be converted into notes.

**June:**
- Amount spent: \$37.37
- Initial amount: \$37.37
- Remaining amount: \$37.37 - \$37.37 = \$0
- Since the remaining amount is \$0, it cannot be converted into notes.

**Konne:**
- Amount spent: \$26.52
- Initial amount: \$26.52
- Remaining amount: \$26.52 - \$26.52 = \$0
- Since the remaining amount is \$0, it cannot be converted into notes.

Since none of the remaining amounts can be converted into notes, the answer is that none of them have any money left after buying the tickets.

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide it by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total score for each group of students:
   - For the 20 students who scored 80 each, the total score is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - For the 8 students who scored 90 each, the total score is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - For the 2 students who scored 100 each, the total score is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this must equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and the diagonals:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}

\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline

Now, let's check the sums:
- Sum of the first row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the first column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the common sum \( S \) is indeed \( 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15 \).

"To determine how much closer Jim is to the center of the rectangular meadow compared to Marth, we need to calculate the distance each person is from the center and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's find the center of the meadow. The center is located at the midpoint of both the length and the width of the meadow. The meadow is 400 feet long and 300 feet wide, so the center is at the coordinates (200, 150) if we place the meadow in a coordinate system with the origin at one of the corners.

Next, we calculate the distance from the center to Jim. Since Jim is at one of the corners of the meadow, the distance from the center to Jim is the distance from the point (0, 0) to the point (200, 150). We use the distance formula for this calculation:
\[
d_{\text{Jim}} = \sqrt{(200 - 0)^2 + (150 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{200^2 + 150^2} = \sqrt{40000 + 22500} = \sqrt{62500} = 250 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we calculate the distance from the center to Marth. Marth is at the opposite corner of the meadow, so the distance from the center to Marth is the distance from the point (0, 0) to the point (400, 300). Again, we use the distance formula:
\[
d_{\text{Marth}} = \sqrt{(400 - 0)^2 + (300 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Finally, we find the difference between the distances from the center to Jim and Marth:
\[
d_{\text{Marth}} - d_{\text{Jim}} = 500 - 250 = 250 \text{ feet}

Therefore, Jim is \(\boxed{250}\) feet closer to the center of the meadow than Marth.","[250, '250']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity.

These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
