"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the length \(EF\) is simply the difference in the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), which is \(7 - 0 = 7\) units. This confirms that the given length of \(EF\) is correct.

Next, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We use the distributive property to expand this product:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})(-1)
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3 \cdot 2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3

   Combine the real and imaginary parts:
   \[
   = \left(1 + 3 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(1 - 3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i

   \[
   = \left(4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the rotated complex number:
   \[
   w = \left(4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i + 2 - 3i

"To determine how many different ways 8 children can be divided into two groups of 4, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must each be in different groups, we can follow these steps:

1. **Choose the group for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas:**
   - Pierre can be in either group.
   - Rosa can be in either group, but she must be in a different group than Pierre.
   - Thomas can be in either group, but he must be in a different group than both Pierre and Rosa.
   - Therefore, there are \(2 \times 1 \times 1 = 2\) ways to assign Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas to the two groups.

2. **Choose the group for the remaining 5 children:**
   - After assigning Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, we have 5 children left to assign to the two groups.
   - We need to choose 1 more child to join Pierre's group (since Pierre's group already has 1 child, and we need a total of 4 children in his group).
   - The number of ways to choose 1 child out of 5 is \(\binom{5}{1} = 5\).
   - The remaining 4 children will automatically go to the other group.

3. **Combine the choices:**
   - The total number of ways to divide the 8 children into two groups of 4, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in different groups, is the product of the number of ways to assign Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas and the number of ways to assign the remaining 5 children.
   - Therefore, the total number of ways is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Thus, the number of different ways to divide the 8 children into two groups of 4, with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in different groups, is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To determine if \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we start by substituting \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). Then, we need to evaluate the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) into the expression:
\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, substitute these congruences back into the original expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

Now, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,
\]
so
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.
\]

Since 3 is not congruent to 0 modulo 7, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is not divisible by 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

"To determine the minimal degree of a polynomial that can approximate a function with a given error, we need to consider the properties of polynomial approximation and the error term associated with it. The error in approximating a function \( f(x) \) by a polynomial \( P(x) \) of degree \( n \) is given by the remainder term \( R_n(x) \), which can be expressed using Taylor's theorem or Lagrange's form of the remainder.

For a function \( f(x) \) that is \( (n+1) \)-times differentiable on an interval \([a, b]\), the remainder term \( R_n(x) \) for the Taylor polynomial of degree \( n \) is given by:
\[ R_n(x) = \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1} \]
for some \(\xi\) in the interval \([a, x]\).

To ensure that the error \( R_n(x) \) is less than a given tolerance \(\epsilon\) for all \( x \) in the interval \([a, b]\), we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that:
\[ \left| R_n(x) \right| < \epsilon \]
for all \( x \) in \([a, b]\).

This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[ \left| \frac{f^{(n+1)}(\xi)}{(n+1)!} (x-a)^{n+1} \right| < \epsilon \]
or
\[ \left| f^{(n+1)}(\xi) \right| \frac{(x-a)^{n+1}}{(n+1)!} < \epsilon. \]

To find the minimal \( n \), we need to consider the maximum value of \( \left| f^{(n+1)}(\xi) \right| \) on the interval \([a, b]\) and the maximum value of \( \left| (x-a)^{n+1} \right| \) on the interval \([a, b]\). However, without specific information about the function \( f(x) \) and the interval \([a, b]\), we cannot determine the exact value of \( n \).

In general, the minimal degree \( n \) of the polynomial that can approximate a function \( f(x) \) with a given error \(\epsilon\) depends on the smoothness of the function and the interval. For a function that is smooth (i.e., has many continuous derivatives), a higher degree polynomial may be needed to achieve the desired accuracy.

Therefore, the minimal degree of the polynomial that can approximate a function with a given error is \(\boxed{2}\) for a quadratic function, which is the simplest non-trivial polynomial. For more complex functions, the degree may need to be higher, but without specific information, we cannot determine the exact minimal degree.","[2, '2']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we start by using the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and their corresponding values for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**

"To find the smallest real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we need to understand the properties of exponentiation involving the number 1. Specifically, we need to know that any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1. In this case, the base is 1, so the value of the expression will always be 1, regardless of the exponent.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the base and the exponent in the expression \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\).
   - The base is 1.
   - The exponent is \(2^{235423523}\).

2. Recall the property of exponentiation that states \(a^b = 1\) if \(a = 1\) and \(b\) is any real number.
   - In this problem, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2^{235423523}\).

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). This means that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, we use the fact that \( z^5 = 1 \), which implies \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to obtain:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1

Thus, we have:

"To solve the problem of subtracting \(18_9\) from \(58_9\) in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9

To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]

So, \(36\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

We can simplify the numerator using the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[

We can cancel one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( t \) be the number of treekys in a sveria that tiek pat, kiek trys skvygai.
- \( s \) be the number of treekys in a sveria that tiek pat, kiek viens skvyga.
- \( g \) be the number of treekys in a sveria that tiek pat, kiek viens skvyga.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ten treekys and three skvygai sveria tiek pat, kiek viens gulis.
2. Two treekys and one gulis sveria tiek pat, kiek viens skvyga.

We can express these relationships as:
1. \( 10t + 3g = 1 \)
2. \( 2t + g = 1 \)

We need to find the number of treekys in a sveria that tiek pat, kiek viens skvyga, which is \( s \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 1 - 2t \]

Next, substitute \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t + 3(1 - 2t) = 1 \]

Simplify and solve for \( t \):
\[ 10t + 3 - 6t = 1 \]
\[ 4t + 3 = 1 \]
\[ 4t = 1 - 3 \]
\[ 4t = -2 \]
\[ t = -\frac{1}{2} \]

Now substitute \( t = -\frac{1}{2} \) back into the equation for \( g \):
\[ g = 1 - 2\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) \]
\[ g = 1 + 1 \]
\[ g = 2 \]

Since \( s \) is the number of treekys in a sveria that tiek pat, kiek viens skvyga, and we have found that \( g = 2 \), it follows that:

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line exactly once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) piecewise and ensure that it is continuous and covers all possible \(y\)-values.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ 
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. 
\end{cases} \]

First, let's check the continuity of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
- The left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is:
  \[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a^2 + 2a. \]
- The right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is:
  \[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a^3. \]
- The value of \(f(a)\) is:
  \[ f(a) = a^3. \]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

Since \(a\) is a positive constant, we discard \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\). Therefore, \(a = 2\).

Next, we need to verify that \(a = 2\) ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line exactly once. For \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2, \\ 
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2. 
\end{cases} \]

- For \(x \geq 2\), \(f(x) = 2x^2\) is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \(x = 0\) and \(f(2) = 8\). Therefore, \(f(x) \geq 8\) for \(x \geq 2\).
- For \(x < 2\), \(f(x) = 2x + 4\) is a line with a slope of 2 and a y-intercept of 4. Therefore, \(f(x) < 8\) for \(x < 2\).

Since the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 2\) and covers all \(y\)-values from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\), it intersects every horizontal line exactly once.

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line exactly once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \(x\), so we have:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

We also know that \(f(a) \neq a\), so:

\[ \lambda a(1 - a) \neq a. \]

If \(a = 0\), then \(f(0) = 0\), which does not satisfy \(f(f(0)) = 0\) unless \(\lambda = 0\), but \(\lambda\) must be in the interval \([0, 4]\). Therefore, \(a \neq 0\).

We can divide both sides of the equation by \(a\):

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - a)(1 - \lambda (1 - a)) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - a - \lambda + \lambda a) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 a - \lambda^3 + \lambda^3 a = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - a) - \lambda^3 (1 - a) = 1, \]
\[ (\lambda^2 - \lambda^3)(1 - a) = 1. \]

Since \(a = \frac{\lambda x(1 - x)}{\lambda x(1 - x)}\), we can substitute \(a\) back into the equation. However, a simpler approach is to consider the quadratic equation in terms of \(a\):

\[ \lambda^2 a^2 - \lambda^2 a + \lambda^3 a - \lambda^3 = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 a^2 + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2) a - \lambda^3 = 1. \]

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(a \in (0, 1)\) such that \(f(a) \neq a\). This is a quadratic equation in \(a\):

\[ \lambda^2 a^2 + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2) a - \lambda^3 - 1 = 0. \]

The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be non-negative for real solutions to exist:

\[ (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2)^2 - 4 \lambda^2 (-\lambda^3 - 1) \ge 0, \]
\[ \lambda^6 - 2\lambda^5 + \lambda^4 + 4\lambda^5 + 4\lambda^2 \ge 0, \]
\[ \lambda^6 + 2\lambda^5 + \lambda^4 + 4\lambda^2 \ge 0. \]

This inequality is always true for \(\lambda \ge 0\). However, we need to ensure that the solutions \(a\) are in the interval \((0, 1)\) and that \(f(a) \neq a\). By analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we see that it is a parabola opening downwards with roots at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}. \]

For \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution, \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) must be in the interval \((0, 1)\):

\[ 0 < \frac{\lambda}{4} < 1, \]
\[ 0 < \lambda < 4. \]

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these formulas, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ + \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can further simplify this by using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) again. Let \(x = 25^\circ\). Then \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, we have:

\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 35^\circ.

"To determine which countries have a border that touches the ellipse defined by the equation \(x^2 + 4y^2 = 4\), we first need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of an ellipse. The given equation is:

\[x^2 + 4y^2 = 4\]

We can divide every term by 4 to get:

\[\frac{x^2}{4} + \frac{4y^2}{4} = \frac{4}{4}\]

This simplifies to:

\[\frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1\]

or

\[\frac{x^2}{2^2} + \frac{y^2}{1^2} = 1\]

This is the standard form of an ellipse \(\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1\), where \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\). The ellipse is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a semi-major axis of 2 along the x-axis and a semi-minor axis of 1 along the y-axis.

Next, we need to identify which countries have a border that touches this ellipse. The ellipse is a horizontal ellipse with a width of 4 units (from \(-2\) to \(2\) on the x-axis) and a height of 2 units (from \(-1\) to \(1\) on the y-axis).

We will check the borders of the countries listed:

1. **United States**: The U.S. has a border that touches the ellipse. The U.S. is located to the east of the ellipse, and its closest point to the ellipse is on the x-axis at \(x = 2\), which is exactly the semi-major axis of the ellipse.

2. **United Kingdom**: The U.K. has a border that touches the ellipse. The U.K. is located to the east of the ellipse, and its closest point to the ellipse is on the x-axis at \(x = 2\), which is exactly the semi-major axis of the ellipse.

3. **Canada**: The Canadian border touches the ellipse. The Canadian border is a vertical line at \(x = -1\), which is within the range of the ellipse's semi-major axis.

4. **Australia**: The Australian border does not touch the ellipse. The Australian border is a vertical line at \(x = -1\), which is outside the range of the ellipse's semi-major axis.

5. **New Zealand**: The New Zealand border does not touch the ellipse. The New Zealand border is a vertical line at \(x = -1\), which is outside the range of the ellipse's semi-major axis.

6. **South Africa**: The South African border does not touch the ellipse. The South African border is a vertical line at \(x = -1\), which is outside the range of the ellipse's semi-major axis.

7. **Nigeria**: The Nigeria border does not touch the ellipse. The Nigeria border is a vertical line at \(x = -1\), which is outside the range of the ellipse's semi-major axis.

8. **Ghana**: The Ghana border does not touch the ellipse. The Ghana border is a vertical line at \(x = -1\), which is outside the range of the ellipse's semi-major axis.

"To determine how many trailing zeros are in the factorial of 42, we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of all integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the factorial.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher powers of 5 will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its partial derivatives.

First, we compute the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]

To find the critical points, we set these partial derivatives to zero:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]

From the first equation, we get:
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^4.
\]

From the second equation, we get:
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^4.
\]

Since both equations are identical, we can use one of them to find a relationship between \( x \) and \( y \). Let's assume \( x = y \). Substituting \( y = x \) into the equation, we get:
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 x^4,
\]
\[
(1 - x^2)^2 = x^6.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
1 - x^2 = x^3 \quad \text{or} \quad 1 - x^2 = -x^3.
\]

Solving \( 1 - x^2 = x^3 \):
\[
x^3 + x^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

This cubic equation has one real root, which we can approximate as \( x \approx 0.75488 \). Solving \( 1 - x^2 = -x^3 \):
\[
x^3 - x^2 + 1 = 0.
\]

This cubic equation has no real roots. Therefore, the only real solution is \( x \approx 0.75488 \) and \( y \approx 0.75488 \).

Now, we evaluate \( f(x, y) \) at this point:
\[
f(0.75488, 0.75488) = 0.75488 \sqrt{1 - 0.75488^2} + 0.75488 \sqrt{1 - 0.75488^2} = 2 \cdot 0.75488 \sqrt{1 - 0.75488^2}.
\]

Calculating the value inside the square root:
\[
1 - 0.75488^2 \approx 1 - 0.570 = 0.430.
\]

Thus,
\[
f(0.75488, 0.75488) \approx 2 \cdot 0.75488 \cdot \sqrt{0.430} \approx 2 \cdot 0.75488 \cdot 0.6557 \approx 1.
\]

To confirm that this is the maximum value, we can check the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). For example, if \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \):
\[
f(1, 0) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1.
\]

Similarly, if \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 0 \):
\[
f(-1, 0) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1.
\]

If \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \):
\[
f(0, 1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1.
\]

If \( x = 0 \) and \( y = -1 \):
\[
f(0, -1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1.

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating this to the given expression, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The corresponding angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \frac{7\pi}{10} \).

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Since \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \theta = \frac{7\pi}{10} \), we have:

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{10} = \frac{255\pi}{10} = 25.5\pi = 25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{10} = \frac{595\pi}{10} = 59.5\pi = 59\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}. \]

In both cases, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 0 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and the fact that the centroid divides each median in the ratio 2:1. The centroid \(G\) of a triangle \(ABC\) is the point where the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) intersect, and it divides each median into segments in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that the centroid \(G\) lies on the line that is perpendicular to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid, we can deduce that this line is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\). This line intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\).

Since \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, the line through \(G\) perpendicular to \(BC\) (which is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\)) will intersect \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(M\) and \(N\) such that \(M\) and \(N\) are the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively. This is because the centroid is the balance point of the triangle, and the line through the centroid perpendicular to a side will intersect the other two sides at their midpoints.

The line segment \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and is half the length of \(BC\) because \(M\) and \(N\) are midpoints. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is one-fourth of the area of triangle \(ABC\) because the ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36

Since triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) and the ratio of their areas is 1:4, the ratio of their corresponding sides is 1:2. Therefore, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is four times the area of triangle \(AMN\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, and the area of triangle \(AMN\) is 36. The area of triangle \(ABC\) is four times the area of triangle \(AMN\).

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

   p = 75 - 10d
   \]
5. Since \( d \) and \( p \) must be non-negative integers, \( d \) can take any integer value from 0 to 7 (because if \( d = 8 \), then \( p = 75 - 80 = -5 \), which is not a valid number of penkcentiuli). However, the problem does not specify a particular value for \( d \), so we can conclude that the number of penkcentiuli \( p \) is given by the expression \( 75 - 10d \).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on the faces of three dice is 10. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each die:**
   Each die has 6 faces, numbered from 1 to 6.

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes when rolling three dice:**
   Since each die has 6 faces, the total number of outcomes when rolling three dice is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216
   \]

3. **Find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the numbers on the three dice is 10:**
   We need to find all sets of three numbers \((a, b, c)\) such that \(1 \leq a, b, c \leq 6\) and \(a + b + c = 10\).

   Let's list all the possible combinations:
   - If \(a = 1\), then \(b + c = 9\). The possible pairs \((b, c)\) are \((3, 6)\), \((4, 5)\), \((5, 4)\), and \((6, 3)\). So, there are 4 combinations.
   - If \(a = 2\), then \(b + c = 8\). The possible pairs \((b, c)\) are \((2, 6)\), \((3, 5)\), \((4, 4)\), \((5, 3)\), and \((6, 2)\). So, there are 5 combinations.
   - If \(a = 3\), then \(b + c = 7\). The possible pairs \((b, c)\) are \((1, 6)\), \((2, 5)\), \((3, 4)\), \((4, 3)\), \((5, 2)\), and \((6, 1)\). So, there are 6 combinations.
   - If \(a = 4\), then \(b + c = 6\). The possible pairs \((b, c)\) are \((1, 5)\), \((2, 4)\), \((3, 3)\), \((4, 2)\), and \((5, 1)\). So, there are 5 combinations.
   - If \(a = 5\), then \(b + c = 5\). The possible pairs \((b, c)\) are \((1, 4)\), \((2, 3)\), \((3, 2)\), and \((4, 1)\). So, there are 4 combinations.

   Adding up all these combinations, we get:
   \[
   4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 27

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

2. Since \( a = 4 \), substitute \( x = 4 \) into the equation.
3. Solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

Next, we simplify the left side of the equation:

"To find the area of the shaded region in the given figure, we need to calculate the area of the two squares and then subtract the area of the overlapping triangle.

First, let's determine the side length of each square. The figure shows that the side length of the larger square is 3 units, and the side length of the smaller square is 2 units. The overlapping triangle is a right triangle with its base along the side of the smaller square and its height along the side of the larger square.

The base of the triangle is 2 units, and the height of the triangle is 4 units (since the height is the same as the side length of the larger square). The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

Next, we calculate the area of each square. The area of a square is given by the formula:
\[

The area of the larger square is:
\[

\]

The total area of the two squares is:
\[

Finally, we subtract the area of the overlapping triangle from the total area of the two squares to get the area of the shaded region:
\[

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:

"To determine the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 450, we start by finding the prime factorization of 450. We can do this by dividing 450 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. Divide 450 by 2:
   \[
   450 \div 2 = 225
   \]
   So, 450 = 2 × 225.

2. Divide 225 by 3:
   \[
   225 \div 3 = 75
   \]
   So, 450 = 2 × 3 × 75.

3. Divide 75 by 3:
   \[
   75 \div 3 = 25
   \]
   So, 450 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 25.

4. Divide 25 by 5:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5

   So, 450 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5.

5. Divide 5 by 5:

The prime factorization of 450 is \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\). The smallest positive integer that is a multiple of 450 is 450 itself. Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{450}\).","[450, '450']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the last cell of the last row of the 4x4 grid is empty after placing the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the first row and the numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8 in the second row, and then placing the numbers 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the third row.

First, let's consider the placement of the numbers in the first two rows. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be placed in the first row in any order, and the numbers 5, 6, 7, and 8 can be placed in the second row in any order. The number of ways to arrange 4 numbers is \(4!\) (4 factorial), which is \(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\). Therefore, there are \(24 \times 24 = 576\) ways to place the numbers in the first two rows.

Next, we need to consider the placement of the numbers 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the third row. The number 9 can be placed in any of the 4 cells in the third row, the number 10 can be placed in any of the remaining 3 cells, the number 11 can be placed in any of the remaining 2 cells, and the number 12 can be placed in the last remaining cell. Therefore, there are \(4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24\) ways to place the numbers 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the third row.

Now, we need to determine the probability that the last cell of the last row is empty. Since the numbers 9, 10, 11, and 12 are all placed in the third row, the last cell of the last row will be empty if and only if the last cell of the third row is empty. The last cell of the third row can be any of the 4 cells, and only one of these cells will be empty. Therefore, the probability that the last cell of the third row is empty is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

Since the placement of the numbers in the first two rows does not affect the probability that the last cell of the third row is empty, the overall probability that the last cell of the last row is empty is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in Cartesian coordinates means that the \( z \)-coordinate is a constant. In cylindrical coordinates, the \( z \)-coordinate remains the same as in Cartesian coordinates. Therefore, the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates is simply:

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. Horizontal shifts do not change the sum of the roots of a polynomial. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \).

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This gives us:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) again to rewrite the expression in terms of sine:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.

So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). We need to find a way to simplify the expression \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\).

"To determine the minimum number of sides of a polygon where the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides. The sum of the interior angles is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

Let's denote the missing interior angle by \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:

\[

\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 180(n-2) - 1070

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a polygon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we have the inequality:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180

We will solve this compound inequality in two parts. First, solve \(0 < 180(n-2) - 1070\):

\[

\[

\[

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, so \(n \geq 8\).

Next, solve \(180(n-2) - 1070 < 180\):

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic equation:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Since we are looking for \( 0 < t < 23 \), the solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). To verify, we check both values:

"To find the sum of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify what the radical conjugate is. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

"To determine the 2003rd term in the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, \(\dots\), we first recognize that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

Now, we need to evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\) and \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = x\), we get:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]

Substituting these into the expression for \(\sin(2\theta)\), we have:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Therefore, the solutions are:

\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

We need to check if these solutions are valid by ensuring they satisfy the original equation. Both solutions are real and within the domain of the arctangent and arccotangent functions. Thus, the solutions to the equation are:

"To determine the distance between the two skew lines given by the parametric equations:
\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check if the direction vectors are parallel:**
   The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).
   The direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).
   Notice that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the direction vectors are parallel. This means the lines are either parallel or skew. Since they are not in the same plane (as we will check next), they are skew.

2. **Check if the lines intersect:**
   To check if the lines intersect, we need to see if there exist values of \(t\) and \(u\) such that \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{r}_2\). This gives us the system of equations:
   \[
   3 + 2t = -5 + 4u
   \]
   \[
   -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u
   \]
   \[
   1 - 2t = 6 - 4u
   \]
   Simplify each equation:
   \[
   2t - 4u = -8 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
   \]
   \[
   -9t + 18u = 7 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \]
   \[
   -2t + 4u = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
   \]
   Notice that Equation 1 and Equation 3 are identical, so we only need to solve one of them along with Equation 2. Solve Equation 1 for \(t\):
   \[
   t = 2u - 4
   \]
   Substitute \(t = 2u - 4\) into Equation 2:
   \[
   -9(2u - 4) + 18u = 7
   \]
   \[
   -18u + 36 + 18u = 7
   \]
   \[
   36 = 7
   \]
   This is a contradiction, so there are no values of \(t\) and \(u\) that satisfy all three equations simultaneously. Therefore, the lines do not intersect.

3. **Calculate the distance between the skew lines:**
   The distance \(d\) between two skew lines can be found using the formula:
   \[
   d = \frac{|\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2)|}{|\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2|}
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{b}\) is the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\).

   First, find the cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2\):
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4))
   \]
   \[
   = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \mathbf{0}
   \]
   Since \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_2 = \mathbf{0}\), the direction vectors are parallel, and the lines are skew. However, we can still use the formula for the distance between skew lines, but we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\) or \(\mathbf{d}_2\).

   The correct distance is:
   \[
   d = \frac{|\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{d}_1|}{|\mathbf{d}_1|}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]
   \[
   \mathbf{d}_1 \cdot \mathbf{b} = 2(-8) + (-9)(7) + (-2)(5) = -16 - 63 - 10 = -89
   \]
   \[
   |\mathbf{d}_1| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
   \]
   \[

"To determine how many lattice points (points with integer coordinates) lie inside the square defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to count all the integer coordinate points that satisfy the inequality \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\).

First, let's consider the range for \(x\). The \(x\)-coordinates of the lattice points inside the square must be integers between \(-4\) and \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, the possible \(x\)-values are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible values for \(x\).

Next, let's consider the range for \(y\). The \(y\)-coordinates of the lattice points inside the square must be integers between \(-3\) and \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, the possible \(y\)-values are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us 7 possible values for \(y\).

To find the total number of lattice points inside the square, we multiply the number of possible \(x\)-values by the number of possible \(y\)-values:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the angles in the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have:
\[
\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \frac{1}{2} \angle BAD.
\]
Given that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we know that \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} (AD + BC) \cdot h,
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height, we have \(h = AC\). Therefore, the area can also be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} (AD + BC) \cdot AC.
\]
We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
42 = \frac{1}{2} (AD + BC) \cdot AC.

This simplifies to:
\[

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of a triangle is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot AC.
\]

To find \(AD \cdot AC\), we use the fact that \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot AC.
\]

We know that:
\[
(AD + BC) \cdot AC = 84.
\]
Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid.

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21.

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

The diagonals \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged in an alternating pattern around the quadrilateral.

"To determine how many cylindrical containers with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm can be filled with a sphere of radius 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the sphere and the cylindrical containers and then find the ratio of the sphere's volume to the volume of one cylindrical container.

First, let's calculate the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
Given that the radius \( r \) of the sphere is 6 cm, we substitute \( r = 6 \) into the formula:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
Given that the radius \( r \) of the cylinder is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm, we substitute \( r = 3 \) and \( h = 8 \) into the formula:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we find the number of cylindrical containers that can be filled by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[
\text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4

Therefore, the number of cylindrical containers that can be filled is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

Thus, the expression becomes:

"To determine the speed of the second diver, we need to know the speed of the first diver and the time difference between their dives. The first diver jumps 20 meters per minute, and the second diver jumps 10 meters per minute. The second diver jumps 10 seconds after the first diver.

First, we convert the speed of the first diver from meters per minute to meters per second. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we have:
\[ \text{Speed of the first diver} = \frac{20 \text{ meters/minute}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ meters/second} \]

Next, we convert the speed of the second diver from meters per minute to meters per second:
\[ \text{Speed of the second diver} = \frac{10 \text{ meters/minute}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ meters/second} \]

Now, we calculate the distance the second diver jumps in 10 seconds. Since distance is speed multiplied by time, we have:
\[ \text{Distance jumped by the second diver} = \left( \frac{1}{6} \text{ meters/second} \right) \times 10 \text{ seconds} = \frac{10}{6} \text{ meters} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ meters} \]

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with at least one member from each of the 8 republičian parties and 6 demographic parties, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, let's define the total number of members in the Senato:
\[ n = 8 + 6 = 14 \]

We need to form a 5-member subcommittee such that it includes at least one member from each of the 8 republičian parties and at least one member from each of the 6 demographic parties. This means that the subcommittee must include at least 8 + 6 - 14 = 0 members from the Senato, which is always true since the subcommittee has only 5 members. Therefore, we need to ensure that the subcommittee includes at least one member from each of the 8 republičian parties and at least one member from each of the 6 demographic parties.

However, since the subcommittee only has 5 members, it is impossible to have at least one member from each of the 8 republičian parties and at least one member from each of the 6 demographic parties. Therefore, the number of ways to form such a subcommittee is 0.

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three numbers drawn from the eilės as \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the problem, the sum of these three numbers is 120, and the average of these three numbers is 24. We can express these conditions mathematically as follows:

1. \(a + b + c = 120\)
2. \(\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24\)

From the second equation, we can verify that the sum \(a + b + c\) is indeed 72, but this is a contradiction with the first equation. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem statement. The correct interpretation should be that the sum of the three numbers is 120, and the average of the three numbers is 24, which is consistent with the first equation.

Now, we need to find the maximum possible value among \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). To maximize one of the numbers, we need to minimize the other two. Let's assume \(a\) is the maximum number, and \(b\) and \(c\) are the minimum numbers. The minimum value for \(b\) and \(c\) should be as small as possible, but they must be positive integers. Let's assume \(b = c\). Then we have:

\[a + 2b = 120\]
\[a = 120 - 2b\]

To maximize \(a\), we need to minimize \(b\). The smallest positive integer for \(b\) is 1. Substituting \(b = 1\) into the equation, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:

   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0

   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[

   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:

\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Similarly, for \( \triangle AMC \):
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 11^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 121 + CM^2.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( BM = CM \). Let \( BM = CM = x \). Then:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]

Next, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 \implies BD^2 = x^2 + 1^2 \implies BD^2 = x^2 + 1.
\]
Similarly, for \( \triangle CDM \):
\[
CD^2 = CM^2 + DM^2 \implies CD^2 = x^2 + 1^2 \implies CD^2 = x^2 + 1.
\]
Thus, \( BD = CD \).

Now, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\cos \angle BDC = \cos 3\theta = \frac{BD^2 + CD^2 - BC^2}{2 \cdot BD \cdot CD} = \frac{2(x^2 + 1) - BC^2}{2(x^2 + 1)} = \frac{2x^2 + 2 - BC^2}{2(x^2 + 1)}.
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \( \cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta \), we need to express \( \cos \theta \) in terms of \( x \). From \( \triangle ABM \):
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right)^3 - 3 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right) = \frac{4x^3 - 3x(121 + x^2)}{(121 + x^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{4x^3 - 363x - 3x^3}{(121 + x^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{x^3 - 363x}{(121 + x^2)^{3/2}}.
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( \cos 3\theta \):
\[
\frac{x^3 - 363x}{(121 + x^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{2x^2 + 2 - BC^2}{2(x^2 + 1)}.
\]
To simplify, we can test possible values of \( x \). If \( x = 6 \):
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{6}{\sqrt{121 + 36}} = \frac{6}{13}.
\]
Then,
\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \left( \frac{6}{13} \right)^3 - 3 \left( \frac{6}{13} \right) = 4 \cdot \frac{216}{2197} - \frac{18}{13} = \frac{864}{2197} - \frac{3126}{2197} = \frac{-2262}{2197} = -\frac{2262}{2197}.
\]
This does not match the form, so we try another approach. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle. By symmetry and the given conditions, we find that \( x = 6 \) is a valid solution. Then:
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 36} = \sqrt{157}.
\]
The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{157} + 12.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\]

Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as a perfect square:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\]

The expression \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number, which is always non-negative. The only time it is equal to zero is when \(x^2 + 2 = 0\), but this equation has no real solutions because \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always positive for all real \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\]

We can factor the left-hand side as a quadratic in terms of \(x^2\):
\[(x^2)^2 + 4(x^2) - 21 < 0\]

This quadratic can be factored further:
\[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\]

Next, we find the roots of the quadratic equation \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = 0\):
\[x^2 + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 - 3 = 0\]
\[x^2 = -7 \quad \text{(no real solutions)} \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3\]
\[x = \pm \sqrt{3}\]

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -\sqrt{3})\), \((- \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\), and \((\sqrt{3}, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(x \in (-\infty, -\sqrt{3})\), choose \(x = -2\):
  \[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = 11 \cdot 1 = 11 > 0\]
  The inequality does not hold.

- For \(x \in (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\), choose \(x = 0\):
  \[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = 7 \cdot (-3) = -21 < 0\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(x \in (\sqrt{3}, \infty)\), choose \(x = 2\):
  \[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = 11 \cdot 1 = 11 > 0\]
  The inequality does not hold.

Therefore, the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) holds for \(x \in (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\).

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\). From Step 2, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is true for \(x \in (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\).

Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

\[

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).

Substituting this into the equation, we have:

xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now, substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the highest percentage of vaikinų (students) relative to merginų (teachers), we need to calculate the ratio of the number of vaikinų to the number of merginų for each class and then compare these ratios.

Given that each class has 300 vaikinų and 300 merginų, the ratio of vaikinų to merginų is simply the percentage of vaikinų divided by 100. Let's calculate this for each class:

- For the \(9^{\text{a}}\) class:
  \[
  \text{Percentage of vaikinų} = 41.1\% \implies \text{Ratio} = \frac{41.1}{100} = 0.411
  \]

- For the \(10^{\text{a}}\) class:
  \[
  \text{Percentage of vaikinų} = 34.4\% \implies \text{Ratio} = \frac{34.4}{100} = 0.344
  \]

- For the \(11^{\text{a}}\) class:
  \[
  \text{Percentage of vaikinų} = 20.6\% \implies \text{Ratio} = \frac{20.6}{100} = 0.206
  \]

- For the \(12^{\text{a}}\) class:
  \[
  \text{Percentage of vaikinų} = 11.6\% \implies \text{Ratio} = \frac{11.6}{100} = 0.116
  \]

Now, we compare these ratios:
- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{a}}\) class is 0.411.
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{a}}\) class is 0.344.
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{a}}\) class is 0.206.
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{a}}\) class is 0.116.

The highest ratio is 0.411, which corresponds to the \(9^{\text{a}}\) class. Therefore, the class with the highest percentage of vaikinų relative to merginų is the \(\boxed{9^{\text{a}}}\) class.","[0.411000000000000, '9^{']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

Next, we need to determine the intervals where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the denominator are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37\), which is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 18\). Then \(x(x-36) = 18(18-36) = 18(-18) = -324\), which is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37\), which is positive.

Therefore, the expression \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also consider the points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). At these points, the numerator is zero, so the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is zero, not negative. Therefore, these points are not included in the solution set.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:
\[

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangle, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangle. Let the length of the rectangle be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters. The perimeter of the rectangle is given by the formula:

\[
2l + 2w = 400
\]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:

\[
l + w = 200
\]

Next, we express the width \( w \) in terms of the length \( l \):

\[
w = 200 - l
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:

\[
A = l \cdot w
\]

Substituting the expression for \( w \) into the area formula, we get:

\[
A = l \cdot (200 - l) = 200l - l^2
\]

This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( A = -l^2 + 200l \), which is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 200 \), so the length \( l \) that maximizes the area is:

\[
l = -\frac{200}{2(-1)} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]

Substituting \( l = 100 \) back into the equation \( w = 200 - l \), we find:

\[
w = 200 - 100 = 100
\]

Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are \( l = 100 \) meters and \( w = 100 \) meters. The maximum area \( A \) is:

\[
A = 100 \cdot 100 = 10000

Thus, the maximum possible area of the rectangle is \(\boxed{10000}\) square meters.","[10000, '10000']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],False
"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by recalling that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) means that the length of the side opposite to angle \(R\) is 2 and the hypotenuse is 5.

Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle \(T\) as \(a\) and the length of the hypotenuse as \(c\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the side opposite to angle \(T\) is the same as the side adjacent to angle \(R\), and the hypotenuse is the same as the hypotenuse of the triangle. The side adjacent to angle \(R\) is \(\sqrt{5^2 - 2^2} = \sqrt{25 - 4} = \sqrt{21}\).

"To find the minimum distance between the point \((0,0)\) and the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the point \((x, y)\) on the curve and the origin \((0,0)\). The distance formula gives us:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]

Setting \(f'(x) = 0\), we get:

\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions:

\[ x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is divisible by the square of \(b\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Thus, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron, we first need to understand the structure of the octahedron and the given distances to the other five vertices. The octahedron has 8 vertices, 12 edges, and 6 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other.

Given the distances from \( P \) to the first five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \) such that \( A \) is opposite to \( G \), \( B \) is opposite to \( F \), \( C \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( D \) is opposite to \( H \). We are given the distances \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), and \( PE = 11 \). We need to find \( PF \).

Since \( P \) is equidistant from the vertices of the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that are not opposite to each other is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other four vertices. Therefore, we have:

\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 = PE^2 + PF^2
\]

Substituting the given distances, we get:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = 11^2 + PF^2

Calculating the left-hand side, we have:

\[

So the equation becomes:

\[

Solving for \( PF^2 \), we get:

\[
PF^2 = 203 - 121 = 82

"To determine the ratio of the masses of the centers of mass of the two bodies (Jen's and Jack's masses) to the mass of the center of mass of the system, we need to use the concept of the center of mass of a system of two point masses.

The center of mass of a system of two point masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) with positions \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) respectively is given by:
\[ x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2} \]

For Jen's mass, \( m_1 = 200 \) g, and for Jack's mass, \( m_2 = 150 \) g. Since the masses are point masses and their positions are not specified, we can assume they are located at the same position for simplicity, so \( x_1 = x_2 = 0 \). Therefore, the center of mass of the system is:
\[ x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{200 \cdot 0 + 150 \cdot 0}{200 + 150} = 0 \]

The center of mass of the system is at the origin, which means the center of mass of the system is not affected by the masses of the individual bodies. However, the problem asks for the ratio of the masses of the centers of mass of the two bodies to the mass of the center of mass of the system. Since the center of mass of the system is at the origin, the mass of the center of mass of the system is effectively zero.

Thus, the ratio of the masses of the centers of mass of the two bodies to the mass of the center of mass of the system is undefined. However, if we interpret the problem as asking for the ratio of the masses of the two bodies, we get:

Thus, we have:

"To determine how much each pieštukas kainuoja, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's denote the cost of one pieštukas as \( p \) dollars and the cost of one trintekas as \( t \) dollars. We know the following:

1. Three pieštukai and one trintekas cost a total of \$1.24.
2. Five pieštukai and one trintekas cost a total of \$1.82.

We can express these statements as the following equations:
\[ 3p + t = 1.24 \]
\[ 5p + t = 1.82 \]

To eliminate \( t \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5p + t) - (3p + t) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 2p = 0.58 \]
\[ p = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ p = 0.29 \]

So, the cost of one pieštukas is \$0.29. To find the cost of one trintekas, we substitute \( p = 0.29 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 3(0.29) + t = 1.24 \]
\[ 0.87 + t = 1.24 \]
\[ t = 1.24 - 0.87 \]
\[ t = 0.37 \]

So, the cost of one trintekas is \$0.37. However, the problem asks for the cost of one pieštukas in cents. Since \$0.29 is equivalent to 29 cents, the cost of one pieštukas is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the rectangle has vertices \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have:
\[ AB = 2a \quad \text{and} \quad AD = 2b, \]
so
\[ \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{2a}{2b} = \frac{a}{b} = k. \]
Thus, \(a = kb\).

The region where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four circles centered at \(O\) with radii equal to the distances from \(O\) to each vertex. The distance from \(O\) to each vertex is:
\[ OA = OB = OC = OD = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{(kb)^2 + b^2} = \sqrt{k^2b^2 + b^2} = b\sqrt{k^2 + 1}. \]
The equation of the circle centered at \(O\) with radius \(b\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\) is:
\[ x^2 + y^2 = b^2(k^2 + 1). \]
The region inside this circle is a circle with center \(O\) and radius \(b\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\).

The area of this circle is:
\[ \pi \left(b\sqrt{k^2 + 1}\right)^2 = \pi b^2 (k^2 + 1). \]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[ AB \cdot AD = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab = 4(kb)b = 4kb^2. \]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:
\[ \frac{\pi b^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4kb^2} = \frac{\pi (k^2 + 1)}{4k}. \]

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents of change Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie received in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money each person contributed.
2. Sum these amounts to get the total amount of money received.
3. Determine the total amount of money converted into dollars.
4. Calculate the total change received in cents.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money each person contributed:
- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

Next, we sum these amounts:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money received is \$126.59.

Now, we convert this total amount into cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply \$126.59 by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}

1. Calculate the total score for each group of students.
2. Sum all the total scores.
3. Divide the sum of the total scores by the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The first group has 20 students, and their average score is 80. Therefore, the total score for this group is:
   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600
   \]

2. The second group has 8 students, and their average score is 90. Therefore, the total score for this group is:
   \[
   8 \times 90 = 720
   \]

3. The third group has 2 students, and their average score is 100. Therefore, the total score for this group is:
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

Next, we sum all the total scores:
\[
1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
\]

Finally, we divide the sum of the total scores by the total number of students, which is 30:
\[
\frac{2520}{30} = 84

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals of the given \( n \times n \) grid is the same. The grid is as follows:

\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\

\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3+3+n+1 = 2n+1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2+2n-9+1 = 3n-6
\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2+n+n-1 = 2n+1
\]

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the first and third rows is the same, which is \( 2n+1 \). For the grid to be magic, the sum of the numbers in the second row must also be \( 2n+1 \). Therefore, we set the sum of the second row equal to \( 2n+1 \):
\[
3n-6 = 2n+1
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
n-6 = 1

"To determine who ate the larger portion of the cake, we need to calculate the amount of cake each person ate and then compare the two amounts.

\[
\frac{300}{400} = \frac{3}{4}

Next, let's calculate the amount of cake Marta ate. Marta ate 400 pėdų pločia, and the cake was 400 pėdų ilgio. The fraction of the cake Marta ate is:
\[
\frac{400}{400} = 1
\]

Now, we compare the two fractions. Džims ate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the cake, and Marta ate 1 whole cake. Since 1 is greater than \(\frac{3}{4}\), Marta ate the larger portion of the cake.

Therefore, the amount of cake Džims ate is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the cake, and the amount of cake Marta ate is 1 whole cake. The difference in the amount of cake they ate is:
\[
1 - \frac{3}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

So, Marta ate \(\frac{1}{4}\) more of the cake than Džims. The amount of cake Džims ate is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the cake, which is 300 pėdų pločia. Therefore, the amount of cake Marta ate is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.

"To determine the probability that the player can return to the starting point \(D\) after one move, we need to consider all possible moves from \(D\) and check if any of them allow the player to return to \(D\) in one move.

The player starts at point \(D\), which is the origin \((0,0)\). From \(D\), the player can move to any of the three points \(A\), \(B\), or \(C\). The distances from \(D\) to these points are given as follows:
- \(DA = 5\)
- \(DB = 3\)
- \(DC = 4\)

The player can move to any of these points with equal probability, so the probability of moving to any one of them is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

Now, let's consider the possible moves from each of these points:
1. If the player moves to \(A\), the player can move to any of the three points \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\). The player can return to \(D\) by moving to \(D\).
2. If the player moves to \(B\), the player can move to any of the three points \(A\), \(C\), or \(D\). The player can return to \(D\) by moving to \(D\).
3. If the player moves to \(C\), the player can move to any of the three points \(A\), \(B\), or \(D\). The player can return to \(D\) by moving to \(D\).

Since the player can always return to \(D\) from any of the points \(A\), \(B\), or \(C\) in one move, the probability that the player can return to \(D\) after one move is the sum of the probabilities of moving to each of the points \(A\), \(B\), or \(C\) and then moving to \(D\).
