"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and using the Pythagorean theorem. The triangle \(DEF\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(F\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7, and the length of \(DF\) is given as \(\sqrt{51}\). We need to find the length of \(DE\).

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DE\) is the hypotenuse, so we can write:

\[
DE^2 = DF^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the given values for \(DF\) and \(EF\), we get:

\[
DE^2 = (\sqrt{51})^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

\[
DE^2 = 51 + 49 = 100
\]

To find \(DE\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:

\[
DE = \sqrt{100} = 10
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \).
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i^2 = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{6}{2}i + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})(-1)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3i - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3 \sqrt{2}) = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   Combining the real and imaginary parts, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \left(1 + \frac{3}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\right)i = \left(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2\right)i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   This is done by adding \( c \) to \( z'' \).
   \[
   w = z'' + c = \left(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2\right)i + (2 - 3i) = \left(\frac{5}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 2\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 2 - 3\right)i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. We know that \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), so:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.** There are 3 people in the block, and the number of ways to arrange 3 people in a line is \(3! = 6\).

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the block by the number of ways to arrange the people within the block.** This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[

\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

So,
\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise around its center to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5. This means that it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \) and still look the same. Therefore, the smallest angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \).

Calculating this, we get:

"To determine the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) that lies on the line passing through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we first need to find the equation of the line. We can do this by calculating the slope of the line and then using the point-slope form of the equation of a line.

First, let's calculate the slope \(m\) using the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\):
\[
m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5
\]

Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:
\[
y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)
\]
Using the point \((5, 3)\) and the slope \(m = 5\), we get:
\[
y - 3 = 5(x - 5)
\]
Simplifying this, we have:
\[
y - 3 = 5x - 25
\]
\[
y = 5x - 22
\]

We need to find the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) that lies on this line and satisfies \(x > 7\). Substituting \(y = 5x - 22\) into \(x + y\), we get:
\[
x + y = x + (5x - 22) = 6x - 22
\]

Since \(x > 7\), the smallest integer value for \(x\) is 8. Substituting \(x = 8\) into the equation, we get:
\[
x + y = 6(8) - 22 = 48 - 22 = 26

"To find the value of \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

Given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute this into the definition of the tangent function:

\[

The \(\cos A\) terms in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out, provided that \(\cos A \neq 0\):

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same point. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the polynomial in the denominator. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):

So, \(99^2 = 9801\).

\[

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm (or spectral norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[

\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the volume flow rate and the rate at which the water level rises. The volume flow rate is the rate at which water is entering the tank, and the rate at which the water level rises is the change in the height of the water in the tank over time.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank.

The rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is the volume flow rate, which is given as \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. Therefore, we have:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the volume with respect to time can also be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the height \( h \) and the radius \( r \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We are given that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
As \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(f(x)\) increases from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x)\) covers all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) for \(x \geq a\).

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
As \(x\) decreases from \(a\) to \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) decreases from \(3a\) to \(-\infty\). Therefore, the function \(f(x)\) covers all values in the interval \((-\infty, 3a]\) for \(x < a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every vertical line at least once, the interval \((-\infty, 3a]\) must be a subset of the interval \([a^3, \infty)\). This means that:
\[ 3a \geq a^3. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - 3a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - 3) \leq 0. \]
The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ a \in [-\sqrt{3}, 0] \cup [0, \sqrt{3}]. \]
Since \(a\) is a parameter that determines the shape of the function and we are looking for the largest value of \(a\), we take:
\[ a = \sqrt{3}. \]

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This equation has two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x = 0\) to be a valid solution, it must be in the interval \([0,1]\), which it is. For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be a valid solution, it must also be in the interval \([0,1]\). This requires:

\[ 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1. \]

Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied if \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is satisfied if \(\lambda - 1 \le \lambda\), which is always true for \(\lambda \ge 0\). Therefore, the condition for \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be a valid solution is \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into \(f(y) = x\), we get:

\[ f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x, \]
\[ \lambda \lambda x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x, \]
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1. \]

Rearranging terms, we get a polynomial equation in \(x\):

\[ \lambda^4 x^3 - 2\lambda^3 x^2 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 1 - \lambda^2 = 0. \]

For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) to this equation, the discriminant of the quadratic equation in \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) must be non-negative. However, a simpler approach is to consider the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points. The function \(f(x)\) is a quadratic function that opens downwards, and it has a maximum value at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}. \]

For \(f(x)\) to have a periodic point of period 2, the maximum value \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) must be greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[ \frac{\lambda}{4} > \frac{1}{2}, \]
\[ \lambda > 2. \]

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we get:

\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]

So, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ.
\]

So, the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this expression. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.

If \( y = 1 \), then \( x = 0 \) to maximize \( f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), which is maximized when \( x = 0 \). Thus, \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

If \( y = -1 \), then \( x = 0 \) to maximize \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \), which is maximized when \( x = 0 \). Thus, \( f(0, -1) = -1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can use the substitution \( x = \sin \theta \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then \( f(\sin \theta, \sin \theta) = 2 \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin 2\theta \). The maximum value of \( \sin 2\theta \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). Thus, \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, \( f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 1 \).

From the above analysis, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the position vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The corresponding angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \frac{7\pi}{10} \).

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Since \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \theta = \frac{7\pi}{10} \), we have:

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{10} = \frac{255\pi}{10} = 25.5\pi = 25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{10} = \frac{595\pi}{10} = 59.5\pi = 59\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}. \]

In both cases, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 0 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(EFG\) given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, we need to use properties of the centroid and the fact that the line through the centroid parallel to a side of the triangle divides the other sides in the same ratio.

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Now, consider the line through \(G\) that is parallel to \(BC\). This line intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio in which the centroid divides the medians, which is 2:3. Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

The area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(EFG\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) divides the median \(AD\) into segments \(AG\) and \(GD\) such that \(AG:GD = 2:1\). The area of triangle \(EFG\) is the area of triangle \(AMN\) minus the area of triangle \(AMG\).

The area of triangle \(AMG\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\) because \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, and the height from \(G\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMG\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMG = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}.
\]

The area of triangle \(EFG\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle EFG = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 - \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 - \frac{4}{27} \times 144 = \frac{12}{27} \times 144 - \frac{4}{27} \times 144 = \frac{8}{27} \times 144 = \frac{1152}{27} = 42.67.
\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the correct area of triangle \(EFG\) as it is actually \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle EFG = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16.

"To determine the fraction of the knih that are now matematické knihy among the knih that are left on the three poličkách, we need to follow these steps:

3. Determine the number of matematické knih that are left on the middle poličke.
4. Calculate the fraction of the remaining knih that are matematické knih.

Let's start with the first step:

1. **Calculate the number of knih left on each poličke:**
   - On the top poličke, there are 8 detektívnych knih initially. After removing one, there are \(8 - 1 = 7\) knih left.
   - On the middle poličke, there are 10 matematických knih initially. After removing one, there are \(10 - 1 = 9\) knih left.
   - On the bottom poličke, there are 6 vedeckých knih initially. After removing one, there are \(6 - 1 = 5\) knih left.

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the seventh term \(a_7 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_7 = a_1 + 6d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the fourth term from the equation for the seventh term:

\[ (a_1 + 6d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 3d = 300 \]
\[ d = 100 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(100) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 300 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 300 \]
\[ a_1 = -100 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -100 + 5(100) \]
\[ a_6 = -100 + 500 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are divisible by both 100 and 150, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[
\text{LCM}(100, 150) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 3 \times 25 = 300
\]

So, we need to find how many positive two-digit integers are divisible by 300. The smallest two-digit integer is 10, and the largest two-digit integer is 99. We need to find the smallest and largest integers \( n \) such that \( 300n \) is a two-digit number.

First, we find the smallest \( n \):
\[
300n \geq 10 \implies n \geq \frac{10}{300} = \frac{1}{30} \approx 0.0333
\]
Since \( n \) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \( n \) is 1.

Next, we find the largest \( n \):
\[
300n \leq 99 \implies n \leq \frac{99}{300} = \frac{33}{100} = 0.33
\]
Since \( n \) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \( n \) is 0.

Therefore, there are no integers \( n \) such that \( 300n \) is a two-digit number. Hence, there are no positive two-digit integers that are divisible by both 100 and 150.

The divisors of 24 are all the products of the prime factors taken to various powers. These divisors are:
\[

Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct total value:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 0.01x + 0.10y = 0.75 \)

We can multiply the second equation by 100:
\[ 100(0.01x + 0.10y) = 100(0.75) \]
\[ x + 10y = 75 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( x + 10y = 75 \)

We can solve this system using the elimination method. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (x + 10y) - (x + y) = 75 - 11 \]
\[ x + 10y - x - y = 64 \]
\[ 9y = 64 \]
\[ y = \boxed{8} \] \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse each select from the first six prime numbers is even, we first identify the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

A sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

There are two scenarios in which the sum of the two selected numbers is even:
1. Both Paul and Jesse select the even number \(2\).
2. Both Paul and Jesse select odd numbers from the set \(\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13\}\).

First, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each select a number from the first six prime numbers. Since each person has 6 choices, the total number of outcomes is:
\[6 \times 6 = 36.\]

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes for each scenario:
1. The number of ways both Paul and Jesse can select the even number \(2\) is:
\[1 \times 1 = 1.\]
2. The number of ways both Paul and Jesse can select odd numbers from the set \(\{3, 5, 7, 11, 13\}\) is:
\[5 \times 5 = 25.\]

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[1 + 25 = 26.\]

The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse select is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
\[\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}.\]

Thus, the probability is:
\[\boxed{\frac{13}{18}}.\]","[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",True
"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) and the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = a \) and \( y = b \) into the equation of the line. Since \( a = 4 \), we substitute \( x = 4 \) and \( y = b \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \).
2. This gives us the equation \( 3(4) + 2b = 12 \).
3. Simplify the left side of the equation: \( 12 + 2b = 12 \).
4. Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( b \): \( 2b = 0 \).
5. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( b \): \( b = 0 \).

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given figure, we need to analyze the two filled triangles and the rectangle that forms the base of the figure.

1. **Identify the dimensions and areas of the triangles:**
   - The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units.
     \[
     \text{Area of the first triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
     \]
   - The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\). This is also a right triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units.
     \[
     \text{Area of the second triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6
     \]

2. **Identify the area of the rectangle:**
   - The rectangle has vertices at \((0, 0)\), \((3, 0)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((0, 4)\). The base of the rectangle is 3 units and the height is 4 units.
     \[
     \text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{base} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 4 = 12
     \]

3. **Calculate the total area of the shaded regions:**
   - The total area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the two triangles.
     \[
     \text{Total area of the shaded regions} = \text{Area of the first triangle} + \text{Area of the second triangle} = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]

Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include all the prime factors of 450 in its factorization. Therefore, the number must have at least one factor of 2, one factor of 9, and two factors of 5.

Next, we need to find the smallest number whose digits are all zeros and ones that is divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The smallest number whose digits are all zeros and ones that satisfies this condition is 111111111, because:

\[ 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9 \]

which is divisible by 9.

Now, we need to check if 111111111 is divisible by 450. We already know it is divisible by 9 and 25 (since it ends in 1, it is not divisible by 2, but it has two factors of 5). However, it is not divisible by 4 (since it does not end in 0 or 4).

To make 111111111 divisible by 4, we need to add a factor of 4. The smallest number that can be added to 111111111 to make it divisible by 4 is 000000004, but this is not a valid number since it contains a digit other than 0 and 1. Therefore, we need to find another approach.

Instead, we can consider the number 1111111111111111111, which is the smallest number whose digits are all zeros and ones and is divisible by 9 and 25. However, this number is much larger and not the smallest possible.

The correct approach is to consider the number

"To determine the probability that the figure will be placed on the occupied square of the chessboard, we need to consider the process of placing the figure step by step and the number of possible outcomes at each step.

1. **Choosing the first number (for the column):**
   - There are 4 possible numbers, and each number corresponds to a column on the chessboard.
   - The probability of choosing any specific number is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

2. **Choosing the second number (for the row):**
   - After the first number is chosen, there are 5 remaining numbers (since one number is already used for the column).
   - The probability of choosing any specific number is \(\frac{1}{5}\).

3. **Choosing the square (the intersection of the chosen row and column):**
   - There is only one square on the chessboard that corresponds to the chosen row and column.
   - The probability of placing the figure on this specific square is 1 (since it is the only possible outcome).

Since the choices of the first and second numbers are independent, the overall probability that the figure will be placed on the occupied square is the product of the probabilities of each individual step:
\[
\text{Probability} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{5}\right) \times 1 = \frac{1}{20}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the figure will be placed on the occupied square is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{20}}\).","[1/20, '\\frac{1}{20}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

This fraction can be written as a decimal by performing the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605\]

The finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\).

Next, we identify the digits in this decimal representation: \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\).

Now, we sum these digits:
\[0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\]

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in Cartesian coordinates. Recall that the relationship between cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) and Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) is given by:

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

\[ z = c. \]

This equation describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(c\) along the \(z\)-axis. In other words, for any values of \(x\) and \(y\), the value of \(z\) is always \(c\).

Therefore, the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane. However, since the question asks for the shape in cylindrical coordinates, the most appropriate answer is that it is a plane, which is a type of surface in three-dimensional space.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \) and its roots. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( c \) units results in the function \( f(x+c) \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units.

If the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:

\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of its internal angles, except one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the internal angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the internal angles except one:**
   Let the internal angle that is not included be \(x\). Then the sum of the remaining internal angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Find the range for \(x\):**
   Since the polygon is convex, each internal angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Set up the inequality for \(n\):**
   Substitute the expression for the sum of the internal angles except one into the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{107}{18} < n-2
   \]
   Approximate the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Now, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{125}{18}
   \]
   Approximate the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8

   From the two inequalities, we get:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is:
   \[
   n = 8

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to check which integer \( x \) satisfies \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

and

\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

The odd solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since we are asked for the unique odd solution, we need to check which one satisfies the original condition. Both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are odd, so we need to verify which one is the correct solution by checking the modular inverse condition.

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

Since both solutions are valid, the unique odd solution is the one that is not equal to 4, which is 17. Therefore, the answer is:

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). We can use the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\), we have \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \theta\).

Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

Multiplying through by 3 gives:
\[

\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Thus, the distance between the two parallel lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many points with integer coordinates are strictly inside the given obd literalizerová oblasť, we first need to identify the shape and its boundaries. The given points are \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\). These points form a rectangle with a length of 10 units (from \(-5\) to \(5\)) and a width of 8 units (from \(-4\) to \(4\)).

A point \((x, y)\) is strictly inside the rectangle if its coordinates satisfy the inequalities:
\[
-5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4.
\]
This means that \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

To find the total number of such points, we count the number of possible values for \(x\) and the number of possible values for \(y\). There are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible values for \(x\), and there are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible values for \(y\).

The total number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle is the product of the number of possible values for \(x\) and the number of possible values for \(y\):
\[
9 \times 7 = 63.

Therefore, the number of points with integer coordinates that are strictly inside the given obd literalizerová oblasť is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a lichobežník with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the angles in the quadrilateral. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have:
\[
\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \frac{1}{2} \angle BAD.
\]
Given that \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), the angles \(\angle BCD\) and \(\angle BAD\) are supplementary, i.e., \(\angle BCD + \angle BAD = 180^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BCD = 180^\circ - \angle BAD\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). In \(\triangle ACD\), the angles are \(\angle CAD\), \(\angle ACD\), and \(\angle ADC\). We know that \(\angle ADC = 180^\circ - \angle BCD = 180^\circ - (180^\circ - \angle BAD) = \angle BAD\). Since \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \frac{1}{2} \angle BAD\), we have:
\[
\angle ADC = 2 \angle BAC.
\]
Thus, the angles in \(\triangle ACD\) are \(\angle BAC\), \(90^\circ\), and \(2 \angle BAC\).

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD.
\]
The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21.

   \]
   This simplifies to:

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can use geometric probability and combinatorial arguments.

First, consider the circle and the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on it. The line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the four points. However, since the circle has no starting point, each unique arrangement of points is counted 4 times (once for each starting point). Therefore, there are \(\frac{4!}{4} = 6\) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points are in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the region bounded by the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi
   \]

3. **Calculate the total area of the region bounded by the two circles:**
   The total area \(A_{\text{total}}\) is the sum of the areas of the two circles minus the area of the overlapping region. However, since the problem states that the total area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we can write:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot A_{\text{large}} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Determine the area of the overlapping region:**
   The area of the overlapping region \(A_{\text{overlap}}\) is the sum of the areas of the two circles minus the total area:
   \[
   A_{\text{overlap}} = A_{\text{large}} + A_{\text{small}} - A_{\text{total}} = 4\pi + \pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = 5\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{15\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **Find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   The overlapping region is a segment of the larger circle. The area of a segment of a circle is given by:
   \[
   A_{\text{segment}} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
   \]
   where \(\theta\) is the central angle in radians. For the larger circle, \(r = 2\), so:
   \[
   A_{\text{segment}} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = 2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
   \]
   We know that the area of the segment is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so:
   \[
   2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \theta - \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}
   \]
   The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\) (since \(\sin \frac{\pi}{3} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) and \(\frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{5\pi}{6}\)). Therefore, the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

First, let's calculate the volume of one Valcový pohary. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the Valcový pohary, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm. Therefore, the volume \( V_{\text{pohary}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{pohary}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The radius \( r \) of the tank is 6 cm. Therefore, the volume \( V_{\text{tank}} \) is:
\[ V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

To find out how many pohares are needed to fill the tank, we divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one pohary:

\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \frac{9}{100}.

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from stôp za minútu to palcoch za sekundu, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the speed in stôp za sekundu.
2. Convert the speed from stôp za sekundu to palcoch za sekundu.

First, we know that the bicycle travels 20 stôp in one minute. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we can find the speed in stôp za sekundu by dividing the speed in stôp per minute by 60:
\[
\text{Speed in stôp za sekundu} = \frac{20 \text{ stôp/minute}}{60 \text{ seconds/minute}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ stôp/sekundu}
\]

Next, we need to convert the speed from stôp zasekundu to palcoch zasekundu. Since 1 stôp is equal to 1 palcoch, the speed in palcoch zasekundu is the same as the speed in stôp zasekundu:
\[
\text{Speed in palcoch zasekundu} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ palcoch/sekundu}

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members without any restrictions.**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats.**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party.**
   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, we need to find the largest of four consecutive integers whose product is 120 and whose average is 24. Let's denote the four consecutive integers as \(a\), \(a+1\), \(a+2\), and \(a+3\).

First, we know that the product of these four integers is 120:
\[
a(a+1)(a+2)(a+3) = 120
\]

Next, we know that the average of these four integers is 24:
\[
\frac{a + (a+1) + (a+2) + (a+3)}{4} = 24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
\frac{4a + 6}{4} = 24
\]
Multiplying both sides by 4, we obtain:
\[
4a + 6 = 96
\]
Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get:
\[
4a = 90
\]
Dividing both sides by 4, we find:
\[
a = 22.5
\]

Since \(a\) must be an integer, we need to check the integers around 22.5, specifically 22 and 23, to see which set of four consecutive integers satisfies both conditions.

First, let's check \(a = 22\):
The four consecutive integers are 22, 23, 24, and 25. Their product is:
\[
22 \times 23 \times 24 \times 25
\]
Calculating step by step:
\[
22 \times 23 = 506
\]
\[
506 \times 24 = 12144
\]
\[
12144 \times 25 = 303600
\]
Since 303600 is not equal to 120, the integers 22, 23, 24, and 25 do not satisfy the product condition.

Next, let's check \(a = 23\):
The four consecutive integers are 23, 24, 25, and 26. Their product is:
\[
23 \times 24 \times 25 \times 26
\]
Calculating step by step:
\[
23 \times 24 = 552
\]
\[
552 \times 25 = 13800
\]
\[
13800 \times 26 = 358800
\]
Since 358800 is not equal to 120, the integers 23, 24, 25, and 26 do not satisfy the product condition.

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
2. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.
3. Select the positive solution.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

Step 1: Cube both sides to eliminate the cube root.
\[
\left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

Step 2: Move all terms to one side of the equation to set it to zero.
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

Step 3: Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = -4092 \).
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 121 + BM^2 \]

Similarly, for \( \triangle AMC \):
\[ AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 11^2 + CM^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 121 + CM^2 \]

Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[ 121 + BM^2 = 121 + CM^2 \]
\[ BM^2 = CM^2 \]
\[ BM = CM \]

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \):
\[ BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 \]
\[ BD^2 = BM^2 + 1^2 \]
\[ BD^2 = BM^2 + 1 \]

Using the right triangle \( \triangle CDM \):
\[ CD^2 = CM^2 + DM^2 \]
\[ CD^2 = CM^2 + 1^2 \]
\[ CD^2 = CM^2 + 1 \]

Since \( BM = CM \), we have:
\[ BD^2 = CD^2 \]
\[ BD = CD \]

Now, we use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} \]

Since \( BD = CD \), \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD \). Therefore:
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} \]

Using the triple angle identity for sine:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]

Let \( \sin \theta = x \). Then:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3x - 4x^3 \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ \frac{AB}{\sin \angle AMB} = \frac{AM}{\sin \angle ABM} \]
\[ \frac{AB}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{11}{\sin \angle ABM} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\sin \angle ABM} \]

Since \( \angle ABM = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \):
\[ \sin \angle ABM = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \]

Using the double angle identity for cosine:
\[ \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}} \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \):
\[ \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{2}} \]

Therefore:
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{2}}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}} \]

Since \( AB = AC \), the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ BC = \frac{BD \sin 3\theta}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{BD (3x - 4x^3)}{x} = BD (3 - 4x^2) \]

Since \( BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + 1} \) and \( BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - 1} \):
\[ BD = \sqrt{\left( \frac{11 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}} \right)^2 - 1} = \sqrt{\frac{242}{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}} - 1} \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle. By symmetry and the given conditions, we can deduce that \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \). Therefore:
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \sin 3\theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Thus:
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\cos 15^\circ} = \frac{11}{\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}} = \frac{44}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} = 11(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) \]

Since \( AB = AC \):
\[ BC = 2 \times 11 \sin 30^\circ = 2 \times 11 \times \frac{1}{2} = 11 \]

Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ AB + AC + BC = 2 \times 11(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) + 11 = 11(2\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{2} + 1) \]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\):

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative, i.e., \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). Since \(0 > -4\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y - 3)(y + 7)\). Therefore, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be written as:
\[(y - 3)(y + 7) < 0.\]
The roots of the equation \((y - 3)(y + 7) = 0\) are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). The quadratic \((y - 3)(y + 7)\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Since the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\), the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now, substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine for which ročník the počet jeho mužských cestujúcich autobusom najbližší k \(135\%\) počtu jeho ženských cestujúcich groomingom, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of male students riding bicycles to the number of female students riding bicycles for each ročník and then compare these ratios to \(135\%\).

The ratio of male students riding bicycles to female students riding bicycles is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Percentage of male students riding bicycles}}{\text{Percentage of female students riding bicycles}}
\]

Let's calculate this ratio for each ročník:

1. For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) ročník:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{41.1\%}{39.4\%} \approx 1.0432
\]

2. For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) ročník:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{34.4\%}{33.1\%} \approx 1.0394

3. For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) ročník:
\[

\]

4. For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{11.6\%}{8.6\%} \approx 1.3581

Now, we compare these ratios to \(135\% = 1.35\):

- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) ročník is approximately \(1.0432\), which is less than \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) ročník is approximately \(1.0394\), which is less than \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) ročník is \(1.5000\), which is greater than \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník is approximately \(1.3581\), which is greater than \(1.35\).

The ratios for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) and \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník are both greater than \(1.35\), but the \(12^{\text{th}}\) ročník has a ratio closer to \(1.35\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality will change signs at \(x = 9\), \(x = -9\), and \(x = 0\), \(x = 36\).

Next, we need to determine the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined, which means these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

In interval notation, the solution is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangle, we start by defining the dimensions of the rectangle. Let the length of the rectangle be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters. The drasha, which is the path through the rectangle, consists of two vertical sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the drasha is the sum of the lengths of these four components.

The length of the two vertical sides is \( 2w \) meters, and the length of the two semicircular ends is the circumference of one full circle with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \), which is \( 2 \pi \left( \frac{w}{2} \right) = \pi w \) meters. Therefore, the total length of the drasha is:
\[
2w + \pi w = (2 + \pi) w
\]
We know that the total length of the drasha is 400 meters, so we can set up the equation:
\[
(2 + \pi) w = 400
\]
Solving for \( w \), we get:
\[
w = \frac{400}{2 + \pi}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = l \cdot w
\]
Since the length \( l \) of the rectangle is the same as the length of the rectangle in the drasha, which is the same as the length of the rectangle in the rectangle itself, we have:
\[
l = 200
\]
Substituting the value of \( w \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = 200 \cdot \frac{400}{2 + \pi} = \frac{80000}{2 + \pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that the hypotenuse \(RT\) is 5, we can find the length of the opposite side \(RS\) as follows:

\[
RS = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any prime number other than 1, we find \(a + b\):

   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0

   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

Let's denote the mass of the softball as \( m_s \) and the mass of the baseball as \( m_b \). The acceleration of the softball is \( a_s \) and the acceleration of the baseball is \( a_b \). Since the force is the same for both, we have:

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We now compare the digits in both representations.

- Base 7 digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8 digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits between the two representations are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). Each of these digits appears twice in total (once in the base 7 representation and once in the base 8 representation).

### Step 4: Count the identical digits
There are 3 identical digits in total.

Thus, the number of identical digits in the zápisoch čísla \(629_{10}\) v sústave so základom 7 a základom 8 je \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine how many handshakes occurred on the magical circle, we need to consider that each of the 26 carondeons (16 + 10) shook hands with every other carondeon exactly once, except for the carondeons who were already shaking hands with each other.

First, let's calculate the total number of handshakes if there were no restrictions. If there were 26 carondeons, the total number of handshakes would be the number of ways to choose 2 carondeons out of 26, which is given by the combination formula \( \binom{26}{2} \):

\[
\binom{26}{2} = \frac{26 \times 25}{2} = 325
\]

However, since 16 carondeons were already shaking hands with each other, we need to subtract the number of handshakes that would have occurred among these 16 carondeons if they were not already shaking hands. The number of handshakes among 16 carondeons is given by \( \binom{16}{2} \):

\[
\binom{16}{2} = \frac{16 \times 15}{2} = 120
\]

Therefore, the number of handshakes that actually occurred is the total number of handshakes minus the number of handshakes that would have occurred among the 16 carondeons:

\[
325 - 120 = 205
\]

Thus, the number of handshakes that uskutočnilo na večierku is \(\boxed{205}\).","[205, '205']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by noting that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is given by \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2.
\]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]
For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, the sums and products of the roots are:
\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\[

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 + \alpha_1) + \alpha_3(\alpha_4 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (-2)^2 - 0 = 4.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4.
\]
Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We use the identity for the product of the sums of products of the roots:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2) = 4 - 8 = -4.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4.
\]
We now have the system of equations:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4,
\]
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4.
\]
The possible values for \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 4t^2 - 4 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4\). Testing \(t = 2\), we get:
\[
2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 - 4 = 8 - 16 - 4 = -12 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \(t = -2\), we get:
\[
(-2)^3 - 4 \cdot (-2)^2 - 4 = -8 - 16 - 4 = -28 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \(t = 1\), we get:
\[
1^3 - 4 \cdot 1^2 - 4 = 1 - 4 - 4 = -7 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \(t = -1\), we get:
\[
(-1)^3 - 4 \cdot (-1)^2 - 4 = -1 - 4 - 4 = -9 \neq 0.

Since none of the rational roots work, we conclude that the roots are not rational. However, we can use numerical methods or further algebraic techniques to find that the roots are approximately \(2, 2, -2\).

"To determine the cost of a ceruzka in cents, we start by defining the variables for the cost of a ceruzka and the cost of a veľká guma stoja. Let \( c \) be the cost of a ceruzka in dollars and \( g \) be the cost of a veľká guma stoja in dollars. According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. \( 3c + g = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5c + g = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( g \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5c + g) - (3c + g) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2c = 0.58
\]

Next, we solve for \( c \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
c = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

Since the cost of a ceruzka is \( 0.29 \) dollars, we convert this to cents by multiplying by 100:

\[
0.29 \times 100 = 29

Therefore, the cost of a ceruzka is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The vertices are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four circles centered at \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) with radius equal to the distance from the center \(O\) to the vertex. These circles will intersect at the center \(O\) and form a smaller region inside the rectangle.

To find this region, we can use the fact that the region closer to the center than to any vertex is a square with side length equal to the distance from the center to the midpoint of any side of the rectangle. This distance is half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.

The length of the diagonal \(AC\) (or \(BD\)) is given by:
\[
AC = \sqrt{AB^2 + AD^2}
\]
Since \(AB = k \cdot AD\), we have:
\[
AC = \sqrt{(k \cdot AD)^2 + AD^2} = \sqrt{k^2 \cdot AD^2 + AD^2} = AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}
\]
The distance from the center \(O\) to the midpoint of any side of the rectangle is half of this diagonal:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2}
\]

The area of the square with side length equal to this distance is:
\[
\text{Area of the square} = \left( \frac{AD \sqrt{k^2 + 1}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{AD^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4}

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = AB \cdot AD = k \cdot AD \cdot AD = k \cdot AD^2

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the rectangle:

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 9 \right\rfloor = 9

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how many cents Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie had left after converting their money to dollars, we need to follow these steps:

2. Convert each person's total amount of money from cents to dollars.
3. Determine how many cents each person had left after converting.
4. Identify the person who had the most cents left after conversion.
5. Sum the cents left by all four individuals.

First, let's convert the amount of money each person had from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply each amount by 100.

- Linda: \( \$27.47 \times 100 = 2747 \) cents
- Sherry: \( \$35.23 \times 100 = 3523 \) cents
- June: \( \$37.37 \times 100 = 3737 \) cents
- Connie: \( \$26.52 \times 100 = 2652 \) cents

Next, we convert these amounts back to dollars after converting them to banknotes. Since each banknote is worth 100 cents, we divide each amount by 100.

- Linda: \( \frac{2747}{100} = 27.47 \) dollars
- Sherry: \( \frac{3523}{100} = 35.23 \) dollars
- June: \( \frac{3737}{100} = 37.37 \) dollars
- Connie: \( \frac{2652}{100} = 26.52 \) dollars

Since the amount of money each person had in dollars is the same as the amount they had in cents divided by 100, they all have the same amount of money in cents after conversion. Therefore, each person has 0 cents left after converting their money to dollars.

However, the problem asks for the person who had the most cents left after conversion. Since all four individuals have the same amount of money in cents after conversion, the person who had the most cents left is any one of them. For the sake of the problem, we can assume any one of them, but the sum of the cents left by all four individuals is:

Let's start with the first step:

- 20 students scored 80. So, the total score for this group is:
  \[
  20 \times 80 = 1600
  \]

- 8 students scored 90. So, the total score for this group is:

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2+n+n-1 = 2n+1

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the first row and the third row is the same, both equal to \( 2n+1 \). Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3+n+2+2 = 2n+1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:

\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third column:

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the first column and the third column is the same, both equal to \( 2n+1 \). Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal (from the top-left to the bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3+2n-9+n-1 = 4n-13

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal (from the top-right to the bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1+2n-9+2 = 3n-6
\]

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the second column and the other diagonal is the same, both equal to \( 3n-6 \). Since the sums of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal, we set the sums equal to each other. From the sums of the first row, second row, first column, and third column, we have:
\[
2n+1 = 3n-6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n+1 = 3n-6 \implies 1+6 = 3n-2n \implies 7 = n \implies n = 7

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square:

- Sum of the main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)

"To determine how many fewer steps Jim will take than Martha, we need to calculate the number of steps each person will take to reach the opposite corner of the rectangle.

First, let's calculate the number of steps Jim will take. Jim is moving diagonally across the rectangle, so the number of steps he will take is the sum of the number of steps he takes in the horizontal direction and the number of steps he takes in the vertical direction. Since the rectangle is 300 steps wide and 400 steps tall, Jim will take \(300 + 400 = 700\) steps.

Next, let's calculate the number of steps Martha will take. Martha is moving along the perimeter of the rectangle, so she will take the sum of the lengths of the two sides she crosses. She will take \(300\) steps horizontally and \(400\) steps vertically, but since she is moving along the perimeter, she will take \(2 \times \max(300, 400) = 2 \times 400 = 800\) steps.

Now, we need to find the difference in the number of steps taken by Jim and Martha. Martha takes \(800\) steps and Jim takes \(700\) steps, so the difference is \(800 - 700 = 100\) steps.

Therefore, Jim will take \(\boxed{100}\) fewer steps than Martha.","[100, '100']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]
To combine these fractions, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that visits all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) starting and ending at point \(D\), we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the minimum total distance for the path \(D \to A \to B \to C \to D\).

The distances between the points are given as follows:
- \(DA = 5\)
- \(AB = 6\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(CA = 6\)
- \(DB = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We need to calculate the total distance for the path \(D \to A \to B \to C \to D\):
\[
DA + AB + BC + CD
\]

Substituting the given distances, we get:
\[
5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20
\]

Therefore, the shortest path that visits all four points starting and ending at point \(D\) is \(\boxed{20}\).","[20, '20']",13,"[13, '13']",False
