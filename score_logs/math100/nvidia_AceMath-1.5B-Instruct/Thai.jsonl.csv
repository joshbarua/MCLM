"To find the value of \( DE \) in the given right triangle \( \triangle DEF \), we start by noting that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and the length of \( EF \) is 7. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \( \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} \).

Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \( DF \), we solve for \( DF \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DF \) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \( DF \) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, \( DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2 \). Substituting the known values of \( DF \) and \( EF \), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}

Therefore, the value of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the value of \( w \) after rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   A rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. Since \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), we have:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated next to each other, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated next to each other is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:

"To determine the minimum number of rotations required to return a regular pentagon to its original position after rotating it around its center, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry.

A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5. This means that it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \) and still look the same. To return the pentagon to its original position, it must be rotated by a multiple of \( 72^\circ \).

The smallest positive angle that will return the pentagon to its original position is \( 72^\circ \). Therefore, the pentagon must be rotated by at least 72 degrees.

Thus, the minimum number of rotations required to return the pentagon to its original position is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and then determine the value of \(x + y\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied by \(x = 6\), it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or the interpretation. However, based on the given points and the property of parallelograms, the correct coordinates are \((6, -1)\).

If we were to assume the problem meant to find the value of \(x + y\) for the correct coordinates, it would be:
\[
x + y = 6 + (-1) = 5
\]

But since \(x = 6\) does not satisfy \(x > 7\), the problem might need re-evaluation. If the problem is strictly about the correct coordinates, the answer is:

"To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) where the graph of \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\) has horizontal tangents and vertical asymptotes, we need to analyze the function step by step.

First, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2).\]
So, the function becomes:
\[f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}.\]

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero. Therefore, we set the denominator equal to zero:
\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0.\]
This gives us the solutions:
\[x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2.\]
So, the vertical asymptotes are at \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). Therefore, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal tangents
Horizontal tangents occur where the derivative of the function is zero. First, we need to find the derivative of \(f(x)\). Using the quotient rule, which states that if \(f(x) = \frac{g(x)}{h(x)}\), then \(f'(x) = \frac{g'(x)h(x) - g(x)h'(x)}{[h(x)]^2}\), we set \(g(x) = 2x\) and \(h(x) = (x - 7)(x + 2)\). The derivatives are:
\[g'(x) = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad h'(x) = 2x - 5.\]
Thus, the derivative \(f'(x)\) is:
\[f'(x) = \frac{2(x - 7)(x + 2) - 2x(2x - 5)}{[(x - 7)(x + 2)]^2}.\]
Simplifying the numerator:
\[2(x - 7)(x + 2) = 2(x^2 - 5x - 14) = 2x^2 - 10x - 28,\]
\[2x(2x - 5) = 4x^2 - 10x,\]
\[2x^2 - 10x - 28 - (4x^2 - 10x) = 2x^2 - 10x - 28 - 4x^2 + 10x = -2x^2 - 28.\]
So, the derivative is:
\[f'(x) = \frac{-2x^2 - 28}{[(x - 7)(x + 2)]^2} = \frac{-2(x^2 + 14)}{[(x - 7)(x + 2)]^2}.\]
Setting the numerator equal to zero to find the critical points:
\[-2(x^2 + 14) = 0.\]
This gives us:
\[x^2 + 14 = 0,\]
\[x^2 = -14.\]
Since there are no real solutions to this equation, there are no horizontal tangents. Therefore, there are no values of \(c\) that satisfy the condition.

### Step 3: Calculate \(a + b + c\)
Since there are no values of \(c\), we only consider \(a\) and \(b\):
\[a + b = 7 + (-2) = 5.\]
Thus, the value of \(a + b + c\) is:
\[\boxed{5}.\]","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in your mind, you can break it down into simpler steps.

First, calculate \(99^2\):
\[
99^2 = 99 \times 99

To find \(99 \times 99\), you can use the formula for the square of a binomial:
\[
(100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm (or spectral norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[

\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

Since both equations are equal to \( S \), we can set them equal to each other:

= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare this expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:

1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

This equation is satisfied. Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

This equation is also satisfied. Therefore, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Finally, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the volume of water added and the resulting increase in the water level. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the volume of water added per hour is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, and the water level rises by 4 meters per hour. Therefore, the volume of water added per hour can also be expressed as the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (which is \( \pi r^2 \)) multiplied by the height increase per hour (which is 4 meters):

\[ V = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Since the volume added per hour is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, we can set the two expressions for the volume equal to each other:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 20 = r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects a horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a = 0\), the function is simply \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \geq 0\), which is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\).

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\).

To find the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects a horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that the parabola and the line intersect at least once. Let's analyze the intersection points.

1. **Case \(a = 0\):**
   - The function simplifies to \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \geq 0\) and \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x < 0\). This is a single horizontal line at \(y = 0\), so it intersects any horizontal line at least once.

2. **Case \(a > 0\):**
   - The parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) opens upwards, and the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) has a positive slope. For the parabola and the line to intersect, the value of the line at \(x = a\) must be less than or equal to the value of the parabola at \(x = a\):
     \[ a(a) + 2a \leq a(a)^2 \implies a^2 + 2a \leq a^3 \implies a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]
     Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a(a-2) \geq 0\), which gives \(a \geq 2\) (because \(a = -1\) is not in the domain).

3. **Case \(a < 0\):**
   - The parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) opens downwards, and the line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) has a negative slope. For the parabola and the line to intersect, the value of the line at \(x = a\) must be greater than or equal to the value of the parabola at \(x = a\):
     \[ a(a) + 2a \geq a(a)^2 \implies a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \implies a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
     Since \(a < 0\), we have \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) is always true for \(a < 0\). Therefore, any negative value of \(a\) will satisfy this condition, but the largest negative value is not bounded.

From the above analysis, the largest value of \(a\) that ensures the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects a horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) that makes the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the circle have a radius of 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). This inequality simplifies to:
\[
0 \le \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies 1 \le \lambda \le 4.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point if \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a complex equation, so let's consider the case when \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Then:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), which means \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = x\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) for any \(\lambda\).

However, we need \(f(x) \neq x\), so \(\lambda \neq 1\). The value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies all these conditions is \(\lambda = 2\), because it is the only value in the interval \([1, 4]\) that makes \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}\) a fixed point of \(f\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \neq \frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False
"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) in degrees such that \(\tan \theta\) is equal to the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters L, I, P, S, and the other E is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[

First, we calculate \( 7! \) (7 factorial):

\[

Next, we calculate \( 2! \) (2 factorial):

\[

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the prime factorization of \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the prime factorization of \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Summing these values gives:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) subject to the constraints \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
Similarly, if \( x = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so:
\[ f(-1, y) = y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
The same applies if \( y = 1 \) or \( y = -1 \). Therefore, the function is zero on the boundary of the square \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\).

Next, we consider the interior of the square. To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero. The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
The partial derivative with respect to \( y \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}. \]
Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}, \]
\[ \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}. \]
From the first equation, we can solve for \( y^2 \):
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^4, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = x^2 y^4 - x^2 y^2, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = x^2 y^2 (y^2 - 1), \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = -x^2 y^2 (1 - y^2), \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = -x^2 y^2 + x^2 y^4. \]
From the second equation, we can solve for \( x^2 \):
\[ (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^4, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 = x^2 y^4 - x^2 y^2, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 = x^2 y^2 (y^2 - 1), \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 = -x^2 y^2 (1 - y^2), \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 = -x^2 y^2 + x^2 y^4. \]
We see that both equations are identical, so we have:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = -x^2 y^2 (1 - y^2). \]
To find a solution, we can test some simple values. If we set \( x = y \), then:
\[ 1 - x^2 - x^2 = -x^2 x^2 (1 - x^2), \]
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = -x^4 (1 - x^2), \]
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = -x^4 + x^6, \]
\[ x^6 - x^4 + 2x^2 - 1 = 0. \]
We can test \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
\[ \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^6 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^4 + 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 - 1 = \frac{1}{8} - \frac{1}{4} + 1 - 1 = \frac{1}{8} - \frac{2}{8} = -\frac{1}{8} \neq 0. \]
However, we can test \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
\[ f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the property of exponents, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) is an angle whose cosine is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{5} \). We will use \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) for simplicity, as the cosine function is even and the cosine of the supplementary angle is the same.

Thus,

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{\pi}{5} = 17\pi. \]

We know that \( \cos 17\pi = \cos \pi = -1 \). Therefore,

\[ \cos 85\theta = -1. \]

Substituting this back into our expression for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \), we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and the fact that the line passing through the centroid and parallel to one side of the triangle divides the other two sides proportionally.

First, let's recall that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle \(ABC\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Given that the line passing through the centroid \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), we can use the property of similar triangles. Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians, which is \(2:3\).

Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

Let the area of triangle \(AMN\) be \(A_{AMN}\) and the area of triangle \(ABC\) be \(A_{ABC}\). We are given that \(A_{ABC} = 144\). Since \(A_{AMN} = \frac{4}{9} \times A_{ABC}\), we can substitute the value of \(A_{ABC}\):

\[
A_{AMN} = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64

Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\boxed{64}\).","[64, '64']",8,"[8, '8']",False
"To determine the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of books remaining in each grade.
2. Sum the remaining books from all three grades.
3. Determine the fraction of the total remaining books that are mathematics books.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of books remaining in each grade.**

- For the top grade: There are 24 books initially, and 8 books are returned. So, the number of books remaining is:
  \[
  24 - 8 = 16
  \]

- For the middle grade: There are 24 books initially, and 10 books are returned. So, the number of books remaining is:
  \[
  24 - 10 = 14
  \]

- For the bottom grade: There are 24 books initially, and 6 books are returned. So, the number of books remaining is:
  \[
  24 - 6 = 18

**Step 2: Sum the remaining books from all three grades.**

The total number of remaining books is:
\[
16 + 14 + 18 = 48

**Step 3: Determine the fraction of the total remaining books that are mathematics books.**

The number of mathematics books remaining is 14. So, the fraction of the total remaining books that are mathematics books is:
\[

\]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:
\[
\frac{14 \div 2}{48 \div 2} = \frac{7}{24}

Therefore, the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{24}}\).","[7/24, '\\frac{7}{24}']",\frac{4}{9},"[4/9, '\\frac{4}{9}']",False
"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula for the volume of a cone:

"To find the term that is the sixth term in the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given two terms of the sequence:
- The fourth term \(a_4 = 200\),
- The sixth term \(a_6 = 500\).

Using the general formula, we can write the equations for the fourth and sixth terms:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the fourth term from the equation for the sixth term:
\[ (a_1 + 5d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 2d = 300 \]
\[ d = 150 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):
\[ a_1 + 3(150) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 450 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 450 \]
\[ a_1 = -250 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\):
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -250 + 5(150) \]
\[ a_6 = -250 + 750 \]
\[ a_6 = 500 \]

   - The prime factorization of 150 is \(2 \times 3 \times 5^2\).

2. **Identify the common factors:**

First, note that \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, so \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some integer \( m \). Then we have:
\[
2^{24} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn}

This implies that \( 24 = mn \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are:

"To determine how many gold coins HилLARIM has, we need to know the value of each type of gold coin and the total value of all the gold coins combined. We know that HILLARIM has a total of 11 gold coins, which are a combination of silver coins and gold coins. The total value of all the gold coins is 75 cents. The value of a silver coin is 5 cents, and the value of a gold coin is 50 cents.

Let's denote the number of silver coins by \( S \) and the number of gold coins by \( G \). We have two pieces of information that can be expressed as equations:
1. The total number of coins is 11:
   \[
   S + G = 11

2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents:

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( S + G = 11 \)
2. \( S + 10G = 15 \)

To eliminate \( S \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
G = \frac{4}{9}

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

We can rewrite this as:

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:

\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

\[

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles, excluding one angle, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the given information in terms of the sum of the interior angles:**
   Let the measure of the excluded angle be \(x\). Then, the sum of the remaining angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Since the measure of each angle in a polygon must be less than \(180^\circ\), the excluded angle \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\):**
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine the range for \(n\) by ensuring that \(x\) is between 0 and 180:**
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality \(0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ\):**

   \[

"To find the value of \( t \) such that \( t \) is an odd integer, \( 0 < t < 23 \), and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}, \]
\[ t \equiv -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \pmod{23}. \]
Now, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting this back into the quadratic formula, we get:

This gives us two possible solutions:
\[ t \equiv -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \), both 4 and 17 are valid solutions. However, 4 is even, so the only odd solution is:
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the value of \( t \) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To determine the surface area of the Earth in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

   \[
   r = 3959 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 20925120 \text{ feet}

2. **Calculate the surface area of the Earth in square feet.**

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply the number by its conjugate:

We can use the difference of squares formula to simplify this product. The difference of squares formula states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Thus, the original equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

Setting this equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

We need to check if these solutions are valid. Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) are defined for all real \(x\), both solutions are valid.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel. Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector that connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these points is
\[

\]

The distance between two parallel lines is the length of the projection of the vector connecting a point on each line onto the vector perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. This perpendicular vector can be found by taking the cross product of the direction vector with any vector not parallel to it. However, a simpler approach is to use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines:
\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|},
\]
where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we calculate the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Next, we calculate the dot product \(\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}\):
\[
\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = -8 \cdot 2 + 7 \cdot (-9) + 5 \cdot (-2) = -16 - 63 - 10 = -89.
\]

Finally, we find the distance:

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

Combining these results, we have

We know from the problem statement that

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

To simplify this, we multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\):
\[

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: Four points on a circle can be connected in different ways to form line segments. We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Visualize the Circle**: Imagine a circle with four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on it. The line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

3. **Count the Total Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other three. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

4. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

5. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the smaller circle. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the diagram.

1. **Identify the radii and the areas of the circles:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the region between the two circles is \(4\pi - \pi = 3\pi\).

2. **Given that the total area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:**
   - The area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

3. **Determine the area of the shaded regions:**
   - The shaded regions consist of two segments: one in the smaller circle and one in the larger circle.
   - Let the area of the segment in the smaller circle be \(A_1\) and the area of the segment in the larger circle be \(A_2\).
   - Therefore, \(A_1 + A_2 = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

4. **Calculate the area of the segment in the larger circle:**
   - The area of the sector of the larger circle subtended by \(\angle ADC\) is \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi\).
   - The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\angle ADC) = 2 \sin(\angle ADC)\).
   - The area of the segment in the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle: \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi - 2 \sin(\angle ADC)\).

5. **Calculate the area of the segment in the smaller circle:**
   - The area of the sector of the smaller circle subtended by \(\angle ADC\) is \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times \pi\).
   - The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\angle ADC) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\angle ADC)\).
   - The area of the segment in the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle: \(\frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\angle ADC)\).

6. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded regions:**
   \[
   \left( \frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\angle ADC) \right) + \left( \frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi - 2 \sin(\angle ADC) \right) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   \frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times 5\pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin(\angle ADC) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   \frac{\angle ADC}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\angle ADC) = \frac{\pi}{3}
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{\angle ADC}{180^\circ} \times \pi - \sin(\angle ADC) = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(\pi\):
   \[
   \frac{\angle ADC}{180^\circ} - \frac{\sin(\angle ADC)}{\pi} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]
   Since \(\sin(\angle ADC) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) when \(\angle ADC = 120^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{\angle ADC}{180^\circ} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{2}{3}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{\angle ADC}{180^\circ} = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

"To determine how many boxes of water are needed to fill a sphere with a radius of 6 cm, we first need to calculate the volumes of the cylindrical box and the spherical ball, and then find the ratio of these volumes.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical box, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Therefore, the volume of the cylindrical box is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical ball, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Therefore, the volume of the spherical ball is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

To find out how many boxes of water are needed to fill the spherical ball, we divide the volume of the spherical ball by the volume of one cylindrical box:
\[ \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"To determine the number of ways to form a household consisting of 5 members with at least one member from each of the two political parties, we can follow these steps:

   There are 8 members from the first party and 6 members from the second party, making a total of 14 members. The number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that all members are from the same party:**
   - The number of ways to choose 5 members from the first party (8 members) is \( \binom{8}{5} \):
     \[
     \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

   - The number of ways to choose 5 members from the second party (6 members) is \( \binom{6}{5} \):
     \[
     \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one member is from each party:**
   This is simply the total number of ways to choose 5 members minus the number of ways to choose 5 members such that all members are from the same party:

   \binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we can use properties of cosine and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x = \frac{\sin 8x}{8 \sin x}.
\]
We can apply this identity by setting \(x = \frac{2\pi}{15}\). Then \(2x = \frac{4\pi}{15}\), \(4x = \frac{8\pi}{15}\), and \(8x = \frac{16\pi}{15}\). However, we need to include \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\) in the product. We can use the identity \(\cos \left( \pi - x \right) = -\cos x\) to rewrite \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\) as \(-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x = \frac{\sin 8x}{8 \sin x}\) with \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\):
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right)}{8 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
-\frac{\sin \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right)}{8 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{\sin \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right)}{8 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{\frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right)}{8 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{\frac{1}{2} \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{8 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{121 + BM^2}
\]
and
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{\sqrt{121 + BM^2}}.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\sin^2 \theta = \frac{BM^2}{121 + BM^2} \implies BM^2 = 121 \sin^2 \theta \implies BM = 11 \sin \theta.
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \sqrt{121 + 121 \sin^2 \theta} = 11 \sqrt{1 + \sin^2 \theta}.
\]
Similarly,
\[
AC = 11 \sqrt{1 + \sin^2 \theta}.
\]

Next, we need to find \( BC \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have:
\[
DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1.
\]
Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{(11 \sin \theta)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{121 \sin^2 \theta + 1}.
\]
Similarly,
\[
CD = \sqrt{CM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{(11 \sin \theta)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{121 \sin^2 \theta + 1}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BC = BD + CD = 2 \sqrt{121 \sin^2 \theta + 1}.
\]

Now, we need to use the given condition \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - \angle BDC}{2} = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{CD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]
Since \( BD = CD \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]
Using the identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \) and \( \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) \), we can solve for \( \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \) and \( \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) \) to find that \( \theta = 30^\circ \).

Thus,
\[
\sin \theta = \sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
AB = 11 \sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2} = 11 \sqrt{1 + \frac{1}{4}} = 11 \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{2},
\]
and
\[
BC = 2 \sqrt{121 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 1} = 2 \sqrt{121 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 1} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{121}{4} + 1} = 2 \sqrt{\frac{125}{4}} = 2 \cdot \frac{5 \sqrt{5}}{2} = 5 \sqrt{5}.
\]
The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{2} + 5 \sqrt{5} = 11 \sqrt{5} + 5 \sqrt{5} = 16 \sqrt{5}.

"To find the median of the first 27 positive integers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the first 27 positive integers:**
   The first 27 positive integers are: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, 27\).

2. **Determine the position of the median:**
   Since there are 27 integers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list. This is because the median of an odd number of integers is the middle number, and the middle number of 27 integers is \(\frac{27 + 1}{2} = 14\).

3. **Find the 14th number in the list:**
   The first 13 numbers are \(1, 2, 3, \ldots, 13\), and the next number is 14. Therefore, the 14th number is 14.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So, the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is satisfied for \(-7 < y < 3\).

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have \(0 \leq y < 3\). Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12,\]
which expands to
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
Since \(xy + yz + zx = p\) and \(xyz = 4\), we can rewrite the equation as
\[sp - (x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
We know that
\[x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12,\]
so the equation becomes
\[sp - (sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = 12,\]
which is true but does not provide new information.

Now we return to the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\). We need to find a consistent solution for \(s\) and \(p\). Let's test some possible values. If we try \(s = 2\), we get
\[-8 = 2(2^2 - 3p),\]

First, let's calculate the number of male and female students by bike for each grade:

**Grade 9:**
- Number of male students by bike: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
- Number of female students by bike: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
- Check if male students exceed 135% of female students: \(135\% \times 118 = 160.3\). Since \(123 < 160.3\), the condition is not met.

- Number of female students by bike: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
- Check if male students exceed 135% of female students: \(135\% \times 99 = 133.65\). Since \(103 < 133.65\), the condition is not met.

- Check if male students exceed 135% of female students: \(135\% \times 26 = 35.1\). Since \(35 < 35.1\), the condition is not met.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.

   The expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\).
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.

   The expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\).
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\).
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.

   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

"To find the area of the largest possible field that can be enclosed by the l/month, we need to consider the given dimensions and the shape of the field. The field is a rectangle with a semicircle on each end, and the total length of the l/month is 400 meters. This total length includes the two sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles, which together form one full circle.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The width \( W \) is also the diameter of the semicircles. The circumference of one full circle is \( 2\pi W \), which is equal to the sum of the circumferences of the two semicircles. The two sides of the rectangle contribute \( 2L \) to the total length of the l/month. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 2L + 2\pi W = 400 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:

\[ L + \pi W = 200 \]

We want to maximize the area of the field, which is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \), and the area of one full circle is \( \pi W^2 \), so the area of two semicircles is \( \pi W^2 \). Therefore, the total area \( A \) is:

\[ A = L \times W + \pi W^2 \]

We can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) using the equation \( L + \pi W = 200 \):

\[ L = 200 - \pi W \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:

\[ A = (200 - \pi W) W + \pi W^2 \]
\[ A = 200W - \pi W^2 + \pi W^2 \]
\[ A = 200W \]

To maximize the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:

\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 \]

Since the derivative is a constant and does not depend on \( W \), the area \( A \) is a linear function of \( W \) and does not have a maximum or minimum value within the domain of \( W \). However, we need to consider the practical constraints of the problem. The width \( W \) must be such that the length \( L \) is positive. From the equation \( L = 200 - \pi W \), we see that \( W \) must be less than \( \frac{200}{\pi} \).

The maximum area occurs when \( W \) is as large as possible, which is \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \). Substituting \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \), we get:

\[ L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 200 = 0 \]

This means that the length \( L \) is zero, which is not practical for a field. Therefore, the maximum area occurs when \( W \) is as large as possible, which is \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \).

The area of the field is:

\[ A = 200 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi} \]

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to use the properties of right triangles and the Pythagorean theorem. Here are the steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
   - \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\).

2. **Understand the definition of sine:**
   - \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\)
   - In \(\triangle RST\), the opposite side to angle \(R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\).
   - Therefore, \(\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}\).

3. **Determine the length of the opposite side \(ST\):**
   - Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(RS\):**
   - The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   - So, \(RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2\).
   - Substituting the known values, we get \((5k)^2 = RS^2 + (2k)^2\).
   - Simplifying, we have \(25k^2 = RS^2 + 4k^2\).
   - Solving for \(RS^2\), we get \(RS^2 = 21k^2\).
   - Taking the square root of both sides, we get \(RS = k\sqrt{21}\).

5. **Find \(\sin{T}\):**

"To find the shortest distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(D\) between the origin and this point is given by the distance formula:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]
Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We substitute \(x = \sqrt{2}\) (or \(x = -\sqrt{2}\)) back into the equation of the curve to find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate:
\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Thus, the points on the curve closest to the origin are \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\). The distance from the origin to either of these points is:
\[
D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]
Therefore, the shortest distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), and in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). The sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the vertex \( B \) of the regular tetrahedron, we first need to find the coordinates of the vertices of the tetrahedron. Let's assume the vertices of the regular tetrahedron are \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \). The coordinates of these vertices can be chosen as follows:
- \( A = (1, 1, 1) \)
- \( B = (1, -1, -1) \)
- \( C = (-1, 1, -1) \)
- \( D = (-1, -1, 1) \)

We can verify that these points form a regular tetrahedron by calculating the distances between each pair of vertices. The distance between any two vertices is the same, which is \( \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2} \).

Next, we need to find the coordinates of the point \( P \). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-1)^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 9
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z+1)^2} = 7
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z+1)^2 = 49
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( C \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+1)^2} = 8
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+1)^2 = 64
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( D \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z-1)^2} = 9
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 81
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 11
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121
\]

We now have a system of five equations:
1. \((x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 9\)
2. \((x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z+1)^2 = 49\)
3. \((x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+1)^2 = 64\)
4. \((x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 81\)
5. \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121\)

We can simplify these equations by expanding and combining like terms. After solving this system, we find that the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (5, 5, 5) \).

Finally, the distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(5-1)^2 + (5+1)^2 + (5+1)^2} = \sqrt{4^2 + 6^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{16 + 36 + 36} = \sqrt{88} = 2\sqrt{22}

"To solve the problem, we need to use the principle of conservation of momentum. According to this principle, the total momentum before the collision is equal to the total momentum after the collision.

Let's denote the initial velocity of the football as \( v_f \) and the initial velocity of the baseball as \( v_b \). After the collision, the velocity of the football is \( v_f' \) and the velocity of the baseball is \( v_b' \).

The initial momentum of the system is:
\[ m_f v_f + m_b v_b \]
where \( m_f \) is the mass of the football and \( m_b \) is the mass of the baseball.

The final momentum of the system is:
\[ m_f v_f' + m_b v_b' \]

By the conservation of momentum, we have:
\[ m_f v_f + m_b v_b = m_f v_f' + m_b v_b' \]

We are given that the mass of the football \( m_f \) is 200 grams and the mass of the baseball \( m_b \) is 150 grams. We need to find the ratio of the final velocity of the football to the final velocity of the baseball, i.e., \( \frac{v_f'}{v_b'} \).

To do this, we can use the fact that the football is initially at rest, so \( v_f = 0 \). Therefore, the conservation of momentum equation simplifies to:
\[ m_b v_b = m_f v_f' + m_b v_b' \]

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ m_b v_b - m_b v_b' = m_f v_f' \]
\[ v_b (m_b - m_b') = m_f v_f' \]
\[ v_f' = \frac{v_b (m_b - m_b')}{m_f} \]

Since the baseball is initially moving with velocity \( v_b \), we can write:
\[ v_f' = \frac{v_b (150 - 200)}{200} \]
\[ v_f' = \frac{v_b (-50)}{200} \]
\[ v_f' = -\frac{v_b}{4} \]

The ratio of the final velocity of the football to the final velocity of the baseball is:
\[ \frac{v_f'}{v_b'} = \frac{-\frac{v_b}{4}}{v_b} = -\frac{1}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the final velocity of the football to the final velocity of the baseball is:

"To determine how many times the same digit appears in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). The digits in these representations are:
- Base 7: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). Each digit appears twice in the combined list of digits from both representations.

\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,

\[

We can use the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time to express \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. Notice that:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.

\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = -2 - S_1.
\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we can write:

Therefore, we have:

\[
-2 - S_1 = -S_3 \implies S_3 = S_1 + 2.

Similarly, we can find \(S_2\) by considering the other pairings of the roots. Notice that:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_3\alpha_4.

Thus, we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2 - S_2.

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we can write:

Therefore, we have:

\[
-2 - S_2 = -2S_1 - 2 \implies S_2 = 2S_1.

Now we have the system of equations:

\[
S_2 = 2S_1,

\[

We need to find the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2\), we substitute \(S_2\) and \(S_3\) in terms of \(S_1\):

\[
S_1 + 2S_1 + (S_1 + 2) = -2 \implies 4S_1 + 2 = -2 \implies 4S_1 = -4 \implies S_1 = -1.

Then, we have:

\[
S_2 = 2S_1 = 2(-1) = -2,

\[
S_3 = S_1 + 2 = -1 + 2 = 1.

Thus, the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) is \(\{-1, -2, 1\}\). The set that is not ordered is \(\{-2, 1, -1\}\).

The region where a point \((x, y)\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex can be found by considering the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting \(O\) to each vertex. These bisectors will form a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

The perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is the line \(x = -\frac{a}{2}\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OB\) is the line \(x = \frac{a}{2}\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OC\) is the line \(y = -\frac{b}{2}\), and the perpendicular bisector of \(OD\) is the line \(y = \frac{b}{2}\). Therefore, the smaller rectangle where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex has vertices at \((- \frac{a}{2}, - \frac{b}{2})\), \((\frac{a}{2}, - \frac{b}{2})\), \((\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\), and \((- \frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\).

The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = a \cdot b
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of original rectangle}} = \frac{a \cdot b}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}

"To find the value of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. The modulo operation can be expressed as:

\[54 = 6 \times q + r\]

where \(q\) is the quotient and \(r\) is the remainder. First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:

\[q = \frac{54}{6} = 9\]

Next, we multiply the quotient by 6 to find the product:

\[6 \times 9 = 54\]

Since the product is exactly equal to 54, the remainder \(r\) is:

\[r = 54 - 54 = 0\]

Therefore, the value of \(54 \mod 6\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linsenda, Cheerri, Joonin, and Konin will have left after selling their necklaces and then investing the total amount in a bank account, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned from selling the necklaces.
2. Determine the maximum amount that can be invested in a bank account.
3. Calculate the remaining money after the investment.

First, let's find the total amount of money earned from selling the necklaces:
- Linsenda earned \$27.47.
- Cheerri earned \$35.23.
- Joonin earned \$37.37.
- Konin earned \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money earned is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine the maximum amount that can be invested in a bank account. Since the problem does not specify a limit, we will assume that the entire amount can be invested. Therefore, the maximum amount that can be invested is \$126.59.

After investing \$126.59, the remaining money is:
\[
126.59 - 126.59 = 0
\]

Thus, the remaining money after the investment is \(\boxed{0}\) cents.","[0, '0']",59,"[59, '59']",False
"To find the average score of the students in the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide it by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the total score for each group of students:
   - For the 20 students who scored 80, the total score is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - For the 8 students who scored 90, the total score is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - For the 2 students who scored 100, the total score is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

3. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students to find the average score:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

To confirm that \( n = 7 \) is correct, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and check the sums of the columns and the diagonals:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
7-3 & 3 & 7+1 \\
\hline
7+2 & 2(7)-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 7-1 \\

\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, let's check the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
And the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
And the sum of the numbers in the third column:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Next, let's check the sum of the numbers in the main diagonals:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
And the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal:
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the magic square is valid when \( n = 7 \).

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the segment that JImports before it reaches the point where M imports it, which is the same point on the diagonal of the rectangle. The rectangle has a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet. The diagonal of the rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

J imports the segment at a point that is the same distance from the bottom-left corner as M imports it, which is the midpoint of the diagonal. The coordinates of the midpoint of the diagonal can be found by averaging the coordinates of the endpoints of the diagonal. The endpoints of the diagonal are (0, 0) and (400, 300), so the midpoint is:

\[
\left( \frac{0 + 400}{2}, \frac{0 + 300}{2} \right) = (200, 150)
\]

J imports the segment at the point (200, 0) and M imports it at the point (200, 150). The length of the segment that J imports is the distance between the points (200, 0) and (200, 150). This distance is simply the difference in the y-coordinates:

\[
150 - 0 = 150 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, J imports the segment 150 feet before it reaches the point where M imports it. The length of the segment that J imports is 150 feet, which is less than the length of the segment that M imports. To find out how much less J imports than M, we need to determine the length of the segment that M imports. M imports the segment from the point (0, 150) to the point (400, 150). This distance is simply the difference in the x-coordinates:

\[
400 - 0 = 400 \text{ feet}
\]

The difference in the lengths of the segments that J and M import is:

\[
400 - 150 = 250 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, J imports the segment 250 feet less than M. The answer is:

\[
\boxed{250}

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance that can be traveled starting from any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the perimeter of the triangles \( ABD \), \( ACD \), and \( BCD \) and then determine the minimum perimeter.

First, let's list the side lengths of the triangles:
- For triangle \( ABD \):
  - \( AB = 6 \)
  - \( BD = 5 \)
  - \( AD = 5 \)
  The perimeter is \( AB + BD + AD = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16 \).

- For triangle \( ACD \):
  - \( AC = 6 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - \( AD = 5 \)
  The perimeter is \( AC + CD + AD = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 \).

- For triangle \( BCD \):
  - \( BC = 5 \)
  - \( CD = 4 \)
  - \( BD = 5 \)
  The perimeter is \( BC + CD + BD = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14 \).

Now, we compare the perimeters of the three triangles:
- Perimeter of \( ABD \) is 16.
- Perimeter of \( ACD \) is 15.
- Perimeter of \( BCD \) is 14.

The shortest perimeter is 14, which corresponds to triangle \( BCD \).
