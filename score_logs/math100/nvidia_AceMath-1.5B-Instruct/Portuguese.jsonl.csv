"To find the value of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(F\) intersects the vertical line, and \(F\) is the point on the x-axis directly below \(D\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle.

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, \(EF\) is one leg, and \(DE\) is the other leg. Therefore, we can write:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the result \( w \) when \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) is rotated around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the anti-clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) anti-clockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) anti-clockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \left(\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i\right) \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)
   \]
   We can expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i - 3(-1) = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can be seated around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units around a table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 2 + 7k \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, we have:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 7k + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7},
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 7k + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7},

\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 7k + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, we need to find the product of these remainders modulo 7:

\]

First, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.
\]

Next, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,

so
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

Therefore,

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated anti-clockwise around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides of equal length and 5 angles of equal measure. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after every rotation that is a multiple of the angle corresponding to one of its sides.

The full circle is 360 degrees, and since a regular pentagon has 5 sides, each side subtends an angle of:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that the pentagon will look the same after every 72 degrees of rotation. To coincide with its original position, the pentagon must be rotated a multiple of 72 degrees. The smallest positive multiple of 72 degrees is 72 degrees itself.

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are equal, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the sum \(x + y\) is consistent with the given condition \(x > 7\).

Given the correct interpretation, the correct coordinates should be \((8, 5)\) as the problem setup might have a different interpretation or setup. Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. The denominator of \( f(x) \) is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator \( P(x) = 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) quickly, we can use a mathematical trick. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to use the identity for the sum of a geometric series.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1.\]

We can add and subtract \(99\) in a way that doesn't change the value of the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1.\]

Now, let's consider the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) as a part of a geometric series. The expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is the sum of the first three terms of the geometric series with the first term \(a = 1\) and the common ratio \(r = 99\).

The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series is given by:
\[S = a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1}.\]

For our series, \(a = 1\), \(r = 99\), and \(n = 3\):
\[S = 1 \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}.\]

Now, we need to calculate \(99^3\):
\[99^3 = 99 \times 99 \times 99.\]

First, calculate \(99 \times 99\):
\[99 \times 99 = 9801.\]

Now, multiply the result by 99:
\[9801 \times 99 = 9801 \times (100 - 1) = 9801 \times 100 - 9801 = 980100 - 9801 = 970299.\]

So, \(99^3 = 970299\).

Now, substitute \(99^3\) back into the sum formula:
\[S = \frac{970299 - 1}{98} = \frac{970298}{98}.\]

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( \lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( \lambda_{\max} = 16 \).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \):

\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

\[

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified expression is:

2(3S + G) + G = S
\]
Simplify the left side:
\[
6S + 2G + G = S
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
6S + 3G = S
\]
Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[
5S + 3G = 0
\]
Solve for \( G \):
\[
3G = -5S
\]
\[
G = -\frac{5}{3}S
\]

Now substitute \( G = -\frac{5}{3}S \) back into the first equation:
\[
T = 3S + \left(-\frac{5}{3}S\right)
\]
Combine the terms on the right side:
\[
T = 3S - \frac{5}{3}S
\]
To combine these, convert \( 3S \) to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
T = \frac{9}{3}S - \frac{5}{3}S
\]
Combine the fractions:
\[
T = \frac{4}{3}S

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form should match the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]
By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Solving for \(b\):
\[
3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substituting \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[

\]
Substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \implies -10 - 6 = -16 \implies -16 = -16

This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. By comparing the constant terms, we get:

Substituting \(a = -3\):

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the rate at which the water level is rising. The cross-sectional area of the tank is \( \pi r^2 \), and the rate at which the water level is rising is 4 meters per hour. Therefore, the volume of water added per hour can also be expressed as:

\[ \text{Volume rate} = \pi r^2 \times 4 \]

Since the volume rate is given as \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \times 4 \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = r^2 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0,0)\). For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(ax^2\), which is a parabola starting at \(x = a\) with the value \(f(a) = a^3\). The function \(ax^2\) will intersect any horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c \geq a^3\) at least once.

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a^2 + 2a\). The function \(ax + 2a\) will intersect any horizontal line \(y = c\) where \(c < a^2 + 2a\) at least once.

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, the value of \(a^3\) (the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\)) must be less than or equal to the value of \(a^2 + 2a\) (the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\)). Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the expression \(a(a - 2)(a + 1)\) is less than or equal to zero. Testing the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\), we find that the expression is non-positive in the intervals \([-1, 0]\) and \([0, 2]\). Since \(a\) must be a positive number, the largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the inequality is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is also satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(f(x))\).

For \(\lambda = 4\), the function \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\) has a maximum value of 1 at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{3}{4}\). The function \(f(f(x))\) will have a periodic point of period 2 at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) because \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1\) and \(f(1) = 0\), and \(f(0) = 0\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 1\) and \(f(1) = 0\), so \(f(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)) = 0\) and \(f(f(1)) = 0\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is:

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression \(\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}\) is equal to \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sin 30^\circ}{\cos 30^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\).

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 8.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter I, \( n_3 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter P, \( n_4 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter S, \( n_5 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_6 \), is 1 (since it is already counted as \( n_1 \)).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:

\[

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function's symmetry and possible critical points.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points. The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:

From the first equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = x^2 y^2 (1 - x^2).
\]
From the second equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 = x^2 y^2 (1 - y^2).
\]
By symmetry, we can test the values \( x = y \). Substituting \( x = y \) into the function, we get:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.

Setting the derivative to zero, we get:

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into the function, we get:

\[
f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0.

"Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is the positive root, we have:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}. \]

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Using the identity for the cosine of a multiple angle, we know that \( \cos 85\theta \) can be expressed in terms of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \theta \) is a multiple of \( \frac{2\pi}{5} \) because \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \), which is related to the fifth roots of unity.

Thus, \( 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi \), and we have:

\[ \cos 85\theta = \cos 34\pi = 1. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(ING\), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \(G\) and the medians of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Given that line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the sides, which is \(2:3\).

Thus, the area ratio of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides, which is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

The line \(MN\) intersects \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(M\) and \(N\), respectively, and since \(MN \parallel BC\), the line \(MN\) divides the median \(AD\) in the same ratio as it divides the base \(BC\), which is \(2:1\).

Therefore, the area of triangle \(ING\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\):
\[

Let's start with the initial number of books in each prateleira:
- The prateleira of the top has 8 books of mistery.
- The prateleira in the middle has 10 books of mathematics.

The number of remaining books of mathematics is 8. To find the fraction of the remaining books that are books of mathematics, we divide the number of remaining books of mathematics by the total number of remaining books:

- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

"To determine how many positive integers with two digits are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are \(2\) and \(5^2\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:
\[ \text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2 \times 5^2 = 50 \]

Next, we list all the factors of 50:

\[ 50 = 2 \times 25 \]
\[ 50 = 5 \times 10 \]

So, the factors of 50 are \(1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50\). We are only interested in the two-digit factors, so we discard the factors \(1, 2, 5,\) and \(10\). The two-digit factors of 50 are \(25\) and \(50\).

First, we find the prime factorization of 24:
\[
24 = 2^3 \times 3^1
\]
The number of divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying the results. For 24, the exponents are 3 and 1, so the number of divisors is:

The divisors of 24 are:

There are 7 such values. Thus, the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is:

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. We know that Hillary has a total of 11 coins, all of which are either dimes or nickels, and the total value of these coins is 75 cents.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

From the problem, we can write two equations:
1. The total number of coins is 11:
   \[
   d + n = 11
   \]
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents, we can write:
   \[
   10d + 5n = 75
   \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[
2d + n = 15
\]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11
\]
\[
2d + n - d - n = 4
\]
\[
d = 4
\]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[
4 + n = 11

\[
n = 11 - 4

\[
n = 7

Therefore, Hillary has \(\boxed{7}\) nickels.","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True

The probability that Paul chooses an odd number is the number of odd numbers divided by the total number of prime numbers. Therefore, the probability that Paul chooses an odd number is:

First, let's find the prime factorization of 450:
\[

This means that any multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's break this down:
- Divisibility by 2: The number must end in 0.
- Divisibility by 9: The sum of the digits must be divisible by 9.
- Divisibility by 25: The last two digits must be 00.

Since the number must end in 0 to satisfy both divisibility by 2 and 25, we can focus on finding the smallest number composed of 0s and 1s that satisfies the divisibility by 9. The smallest such number is 111111111, because the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 9.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:

So the expression becomes:
\[

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) is:
\[
\theta = 30^\circ \quad \text{or} \quad \theta = 150^\circ.
\]

The smaller of these two angles is \(30^\circ\). Therefore, the smallest angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:

\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-x) = -\sin x\), we have \(\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \cdot \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{3 \tan^2 40^\circ}{4 \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

However, we can use a known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all its internal angles, except one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the internal angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   Let the measure of the missing internal angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of all the internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Find the range for the missing angle \(x\):**
   Since the polygon is convex, each internal angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle \(x\) must satisfy:
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Substitute the range of \(x\) into the equation:**
   From the equation \((n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ\), we can express \(x\) as:
   \[
   x = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Since \(0 < x < 180^\circ\), we have:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Adding \(1070^\circ\) to both sides, we get:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\), we get:
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Adding \(1070^\circ\) to both sides, we get:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\), we get:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplifying the right side, we get:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides, we get:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

6. **Combine the results:**
   From the two inequalities, we get:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

The number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by understanding the condition given. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, denoted as \( t^{-1} \), satisfies the equation:

\[
t \cdot t^{-1} \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

According to the problem, we have:

\[
t + 2 \equiv t^{-1} \pmod{23}
\]

Substituting \( t^{-1} \) in the equation gives:

\[
t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding this, we have:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearranging the equation leads to:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we will solve the quadratic equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 = 0 \) modulo 23. We can use the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Thus, we calculate the discriminant:

\[
b^2 - 4ac = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1) = 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Now we need to find \( \sqrt{8} \) modulo 23. We will check the squares of integers from 0 to 22 to find a number whose square is congruent to 8 modulo 23.

Calculating the squares:

\[
0^2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
6^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
8^2 \equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
9^2 \equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \). Thus, \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \) or \( \sqrt{8} \equiv -10 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \).

Now substituting back into the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad t = \frac{-2 \pm 13}{2}
\]

Calculating both cases:

1. For \( t = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \):
   \[
   t = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]

2. For \( t = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \):
   \[
   t = \frac{-12}{2} = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. For \( t = \frac{-2 + 13}{2} \):
   \[
   t = \frac{11}{2} \equiv 5.5 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
   \]

4. For \( t = \frac{-2 - 13}{2} \):
   \[
   t = \frac{-15}{2} \equiv 8.5 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
   \]

Thus, the only valid integer solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since we need an odd integer, we discard \( t = 4 \).

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\) and \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = x\), we get:

\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}

Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we have:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}

So the equation becomes:

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:

\[
6x = 1 + x^2

\[

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel. Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors, which will give us the direction vector of the line connecting the two lines. However, since the lines are parallel, the distance between them is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line. We can use the point \(\mathbf{r}_1\) on the first line and find the perpendicular distance to the second line.

The formula for the distance \(D\) between a point \(\mathbf{r}_1\) and a line \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{r}_0 + u \mathbf{d}\) is given by

\[
D = \frac{\| (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}.

Here, \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{r}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0\):

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - (-5) \\ -10 - (-3) \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
(\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-4) - (-5)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-4) - (-5)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-18) - (-7)(4)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i}(28 - 90) - \mathbf{j}(-32 + 20) + \mathbf{k}(-144 + 28) = \mathbf{i}(-62) - \mathbf{j}(-12) + \mathbf{k}(-116) = \begin{pmatrix} -62 \\ 12 \\ -116 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{(-62)^2 + 12^2 + (-116)^2} = \sqrt{3844 + 144 + 13456} = \sqrt{17444} = 2\sqrt{4361}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-18)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 324 + 16} = \sqrt{356} = 2\sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(D\) is:

\[
D = \frac{\| (\mathbf{r}_1 - \mathbf{r}_0) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{2\sqrt{4361}}{2\sqrt{89}} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

First, let's consider the range for \(x\). The inequality \(-5 < x < 5\) means that \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\). Therefore, there are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible integer values for \(x\).

Next, let's consider the range for \(y\). The inequality \(-4 < y < 4\) means that \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\). Therefore, there are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible integer values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\). Thus, the total number of points is:
\[
9 \times 7 = 63

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"To find the average price of the stamps from the 70s, we need to calculate the total number of stamps and the total cost of these stamps, and then divide the total cost by the total number of stamps.

First, let's identify the number of stamps and their prices for each decade:
- In the 70s, the price per stamp is 7 cents, and the number of stamps is 4.
- In the 80s, the price per stamp is 12 cents, and the number of stamps is 12.
- In the 90s, the price per stamp is 9 cents, and the number of stamps is 9.

Next, we calculate the total number of stamps:
\[ \text{Total number of stamps} = 4 + 12 + 9 = 25 \]

Now, we calculate the total cost of the stamps:
\[ \text{Total cost} = (4 \text{ stamps} \times 7 \text{ cents/stamp}) + (12 \text{ stamps} \times 12 \text{ cents/stamp}) + (9 \text{ stamps} \times 9 \text{ cents/stamp}) \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = 28 \text{ cents} + 144 \text{ cents} + 81 \text{ cents} = 253 \text{ cents} \]

Finally, we find the average price per stamp by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:
\[ \text{Average price per stamp} = \frac{253 \text{ cents}}{25 \text{ stamps}} = 10.12 \text{ cents} \]

Rounding 10.12 to the nearest tenth of a cent, we get:
\[ \text{Average price per stamp} \approx 10.1 \text{ cents} \]

Therefore, the average price of the stamps from the 70s is \(\boxed{10.1}\) cents.","[10.1000000000000, '10.1']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) is the same as the length of \(\overline{CD}\), which we will call \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{AB}{AD}
\]
However, we do not need this ratio to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Instead, we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and the base is \(CD\).

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times h
\]

To find \(CD\), we note that \(CD\) is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(AD\), which is \(h\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times h^2
\]

However, we need to express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). From the equation \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can solve for \(h\):
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting \(h\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \left(\frac{84}{a + b}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{7056}{(a + b)^2} = \frac{3528}{(a + b)^2}
\]

Since we do not have the exact values of \(a\) and \(b\), we cannot simplify this further without additional information. However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and the base is \(CD\), which is the same as the height from \(C\) to \(AD\).

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[

4. **Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by \(-19\):**
   \[

   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

"To determine the probability that the segment \(AB\) and the segment \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points on the circle.

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be in one of the two alternating patterns mentioned above. There are exactly 2 such patterns for any given arrangement of the points on the circle.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi
   \]

4. **Determine the area of the overlapping region:**
   The area of the overlapping region is the area of the smaller circle, which is \(\pi\).

5. **Determine the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   The area of the shaded region is the area of a sector of the larger circle minus the area of the overlapping region. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot A_{\text{large}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ}

   The area of the shaded region is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{sector}} - A_{\text{small}} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} - \pi
   \]
   We know that \(A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\), so:
   \[
   \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} - \pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Factor out \(\pi\) on the left side:
   \[
   \pi \left( \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} - 1 \right) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(\pi\):
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} - 1 = \frac{5}{3}
   \]
   Add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} = \frac{5}{3} + 1 = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{8}{3}

   Multiply both sides by 90:

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical bottle. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical bottle, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

The speed of the bicicleta is given as 20 pés por minuto. First, we convert this speed to polegadas por minuto:

Next, we convert the speed from polegadas por minuto to polegadas por segundo:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcomitê combinations and then subtracting the number of combinations that do not meet the criteria (i.e., subcomitê combinations that consist entirely of members from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members of the comitê. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the same party. There are two cases to consider: all 5 members are republicanos, or all 5 members are democrats.

The number of ways to choose 5 republicanos from 8 republicanos is \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to choose 5 democrats from 6 democrats is \( \binom{6}{5} \):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Adding these two cases together gives the total number of ways to choose 5 members all from the same party:

\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, subtract the number of combinations that do not meet the criteria from the total number of combinations to get the number of subcomitê combinations that include at least one member from each party:

\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form a subcomitê of 5 members that has at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three numbers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we know that the product of these three numbers divided by their median is 24. The median of the three consecutive integers is the middle number, which is \(x+1\). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24.\]

Since \(x+1 \neq 0\) (because \(x\) is an integer and the product is 120, which is non-zero), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[x(x+2) = 24.\]

Now we have a quadratic equation:
\[x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0.\]

To solve this quadratic equation, we can factor it. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(6\) and \(-4\). Therefore, we can write:
\[(x+6)(x-4) = 0.\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the possible solutions:
\[x+6 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x-4 = 0.\]
\[x = -6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4.\]

If \(x = -6\), then the three consecutive integers are \(-6\), \(-5\), and \(-4\). The product of these numbers is:
\[-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120,\]
which does not satisfy the original condition that the product is 120.

If \(x = 4\), then the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The product of these numbers is:
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120,\]
which satisfies the original condition. The median of these numbers is \(5\), and the product divided by the median is:
\[\frac{120}{5} = 24,\]
which also satisfies the original condition.

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\), and the largest of these integers is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(4096 = 64^2\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \]
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{AB} \]

Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDM \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[ \sin 3\theta = \frac{DM}{BM} = \frac{1}{BM} \]

We know that:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]

Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right) - 4 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^3 = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{4 \cdot 121}{AB^3} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} \]

Since \( \sin 3\theta = \frac{1}{BM} \), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{BM} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} \]

We also know that:
\[ \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{121}{AB^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}{AB} \]

Using the double angle identity for cosine, we have:
\[ \cos 2\theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}{AB} \right)^2 - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{AB^2 - 121}{AB^2} - 1 = \frac{2AB^2 - 242 - AB^2}{AB^2} = \frac{AB^2 - 242}{AB^2} \]

Since \( \cos 2\theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \), we have:
\[ \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{AB^2 - 242}{AB^2} \]
\[ BM = AB - \frac{242}{AB} \]

Substituting \( BM = AB - \frac{242}{AB} \) into the equation \( \frac{1}{BM} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} \), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{AB - \frac{242}{AB}} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} \]
\[ \frac{AB}{AB^2 - 242} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} \]
\[ \frac{AB^4}{AB^2 - 242} = 33AB^2 - 484 \]
\[ AB^4 = 33AB^4 - 484AB^2 - 242AB^2 + 242 \cdot 242 \]
\[ AB^4 = 33AB^4 - 726AB^2 + 58564 \]
\[ 0 = 32AB^4 - 726AB^2 + 58564 \]
\[ 0 = 16AB^4 - 363AB^2 + 29282 \]

Let \( x = AB^2 \). Then we have:
\[ 16x^2 - 363x + 29282 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), we get:
\[ x = \frac{363 \pm \sqrt{363^2 - 4 \cdot 16 \cdot 29282}}{2 \cdot 16} \]
\[ x = \frac{363 \pm \sqrt{131769 - 1885472}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{363 \pm \sqrt{131769 - 1885472}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{363 \pm \sqrt{131769 - 1885472}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{363 \pm \sqrt{131769 - 1885472}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{363 \pm \sqrt{131769 - 1885472}}{32} \]

Since \( x = AB^2 \) must be positive, we take the positive root:
\[ x = \frac{363 + \sqrt{131769 - 1885472}}{32} \]

Finally, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ 2AB + BC = 2AB + 2BM = 2AB + 2 \left( AB - \frac{242}{AB} \right) = 2AB + 2AB - \frac{484}{AB} = 4AB - \frac{484}{AB} \]

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)

We know that the sum is \(3^7\), so we set up the equation:

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Since \(0 > -4\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y - 3)(y + 7)\). The inequality \((y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\) is satisfied when \(y\) is between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, we have:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]

Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), we discard the negative part of the interval. Thus, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[
s = 4.

"To determine for which series the number of male passengers on buses is more closely approximated by \(135\%\) of the number of female passengers, we need to calculate the ratio of male to female passengers for each series and compare it to \(1.35\).

Let's start with the \(9^{\text{th}}\) series:
- The percentage of male passengers is \(41.1\%\).
- The percentage of female passengers is \(39.4\%\).
- The ratio of male to female passengers is \(\frac{41.1}{39.4} \approx 1.0432\).

Next, let's move to the \(10^{\text{th}}\) series:
- The percentage of male passengers is \(34.4\%\).
- The percentage of female passengers is \(33.1\%\).
- The ratio of male to female passengers is \(\frac{34.4}{33.1} \approx 1.0394\).

Now, let's consider the \(11^{\text{th}}\) series:
- The percentage of male passengers is \(20.6\%\).
- The percentage of female passengers is \(13.8\%\).
- The ratio of male to female passengers is \(\frac{20.6}{13.8} \approx 1.50\).

Finally, let's look at the \(12^{\text{th}}\) series:
- The percentage of male passengers is \(11.6\%\).
- The percentage of female passengers is \(8.6\%\).
- The ratio of male to female passengers is \(\frac{11.6}{8.6} \approx 1.3586\).

We need to find the series where this ratio is closest to \(1.35\). Comparing the ratios:
- The ratio for the \(9^{\text{th}}\) series is \(1.0432\), which is \(1.3068\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\text{th}}\) series is \(1.0394\), which is \(0.3106\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\text{th}}\) series is \(1.50\), which is \(0.15\) away from \(1.35\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) series is \(1.3586\), which is \(0.0086\) away from \(1.35\).

The series with the ratio closest to \(1.35\) is the \(12^{\text{th}}\) series.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), and the expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. From the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\), we get the critical points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). From the denominator \(x(x-36)\), we get the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-\infty, -9)\).

2. For the interval \((-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-9, 0)\).

3. For the interval \((0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} = -\frac{16}{7} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((0, 9)\).

4. For the interval \((9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} = -\frac{19}{260} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((9, 36)\).

5. For the interval \((36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves. The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and it is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), the points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the inequality holds:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]

In box notation, the solution is:

"To determine the maximum area of the rectangular field, we need to analyze the given information and set up the appropriate equations. The pista consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends. The total length of the pista is the sum of the lengths of these two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two straight sides of the rectangle are each \( L \) meters long, and the two semicircles together form a full circle with a diameter equal to the width \( W \). Therefore, the circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \) meters.

The total length of the pista is given by:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We want to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]

From the perimeter equation, we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100 \]

The area \( A \) is then:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum area of the field is:

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that \(RT = 5\), we can find \(RS\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
RS = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values of \(RT\) and \(RS\):

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) as:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \]
Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}. \]
Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}. \]
To minimize \(D\), we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}. \]
We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}, \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}. \]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Substituting \(x = \sqrt{2}\) (or \(x = -\sqrt{2}\)) back into the equation for \(y\), we get:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}. \]
Thus, the points on the curve closest to the origin are \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\). The distance from the origin to either of these points is:
\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}. \]
Therefore, the minimum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), and in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). The sum \(a + b\) is:
\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12. \]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

Given the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) where \( A \) is opposite to \( F \), \( B \) is opposite to \( E \), and \( C \) is opposite to \( D \).

Since \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite vertices, the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) is the same as the distance from \( P \) to \( A \).

Since Jen and Jack use the same force to launch their balls, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]

Using the formula for force, we can express the force in terms of mass and acceleration for both Jen and Jack:

\[ m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls: \( m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \) g and \( m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \) g. We need to find the ratio of the accelerations, \( \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} \). Rearranging the equation above, we get:

"To determine how many of the same digits are found in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

### Step 3: Compare the digits in both representations

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We list the digits in each representation:

- Base 7: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

Now, we identify the common digits:

- The digit \(1\) appears in both representations.
- The digit \(5\) appears in both representations.
- The digit \(6\) appears in both representations.

The digit \(6\) appears in both representations, but the digit \(5\) appears twice in the base 7 representation and only once in the base 8 representation. Therefore, the digit \(5\) is not common.

The digit \(1\) appears once in the base 7 representation and twice in the base 8 representation. Therefore, the digit \(1\) is common.

Thus, the common digits are \(1\) and \(5\).

\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]
For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these values by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]
Next, we use the identity for the product of the roots taken three at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \left( \frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} \right) = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \neq 0\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4}{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4} = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
We can express \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\) in terms of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\):
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 \left( \frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} \right) = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 \neq 0\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4}{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4} = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]
We also know that:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = 16.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 16.
\]
The only set of values that satisfy \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 16\) is \(\{4, 4, -8\}\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one pencil, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information. Let \( p \) be the cost of one pencil in dollars and \( b \) be the cost of one borracha jumbo in dollars. We can translate the given information into the following system of linear equations:

1. \( 3p + b = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5p + b = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( b \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5p + b) - (3p + b) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2p = 0.58
\]

Next, we solve for \( p \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

Since the cost of one pencil is \( 0.29 \) dollars, we convert this to cents by multiplying by 100:

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by simplifying the fraction. The fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) can be rewritten as:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), and vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) at \((-a, a)\), \((a, a)\), \((a, -a)\), and \((-a, -a)\) respectively, where \(a = \frac{AB}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{AD}{2}\) are the semi-lengths of the sides of the rectangle. Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(b = \frac{a}{k}\).

The condition that a point \((x, y)\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed as the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) being less than the distance to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}\). Therefore, the condition is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - a)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 < 2ax + 2a^2 - 2ay
\]
\[
ax + a^2 > ay
\]
\[
x + a > y
\]
\[
y < x + a
\]
Similarly, we can derive the conditions for the other vertices:
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } A\text{)}
\]
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } B\text{)}
\]
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } C\text{)}
\]
\[
y < x + a \quad \text{(from vertex } D\text{)}
\]
These conditions define a region below the line \(y = x + a\). This line passes through the center \(O\) and the vertex \(B\). The region below this line is a right triangle with vertices at \(O(0,0)\), \(B(a, a)\), and the point where the line intersects the top side of the rectangle at \(x = a\), which is \((a, a)\).

The area of this triangle is:

\]
The area of the rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = 2a \times 2a = 4a^2
\]
The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the triangle to the area of the rectangle:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:
\[
q = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]
Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:
\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
- The ceiling of \( 1.0472 \) is \( 2 \), so \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 6.7082 \) is \( 6 \), so \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 4 \) is \( 4 \), so \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   - Sherry: \( \$35.23 = 3523 \) cents
   - June: \( \$37.37 = 3737 \) cents
   - Connie: \( \$26.52 = 2652 \) cents

   Adding these amounts together:

   \]

2. **Determine the maximum number of dollars that can be converted:**
   - Each dollar is equal to 100 cents.

   - 8 students scored 90. So, the total score for this group is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - 2 students scored 100. So, the total score for this group is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 4 \times 4 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \). Let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the sums to be equal, we must have:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n
\]
\[
7 = n

So, \( n = 7 \). Let's verify this by substituting \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and checking the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

The magic square becomes:

\[

\[ d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} \]
For the field, the length is 400 pés and the width is 300 pés. Therefore, the distance Jim traveled is:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ pés} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha traveled. Martha camhou along the length and the width of the field. The total distance Martha traveled is the sum of the length and the width:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:
