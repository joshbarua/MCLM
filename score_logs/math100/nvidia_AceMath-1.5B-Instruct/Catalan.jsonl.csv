"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(EF\) intersects \(EF\), and \(F\) is the point on the x-axis directly below \(E\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \(EF\):
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \).
   \[
   z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method) to expand this product:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:

   \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i^2 \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})(-1) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (-3 + 3 \sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{(-3 + 3 \sqrt{2}) \sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + \frac{3i \sqrt{2} - 6i}{2} + \frac{-3 \sqrt{2} + 6}{2}

   \]
   \[
   = 4 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} + \left(-2 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i
   \]

3. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original position:**
   This is done by adding \( c \) to the rotated complex number.
   \[
   \left(4 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} + \left(-2 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i\right) + (2 - 3i) = \left(4 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} + 2\right) + \left(-2 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\right)i
   \]
   \[
   = \left(6 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(-5 + \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2}\right)i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to seat 8 people around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are seated together is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"Un pentàgon regular es gira en sentit antihorari al voltant del seu centre. Quin és el nombre mínim de graus que s'ha de girar fins que coincideixi amb la seva posició original?

Para resolver este problema, we need to determine the minimum angle of rotation required for a regular pentagon to coincide with its original position.

1. **Understand the Geometry of a Regular Pentagon**:
   A regular pentagon has 5 equal sides and 5 equal angles. The total internal angle of a pentagon is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n - 2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   (5 - 2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
   \]

2. **Calculate the Central Angle**:
   The central angle of a regular pentagon is the angle subtended at the center by one of its sides. This can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
   \]
   For a pentagon:
   \[
   \text{Central Angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
   \]

3. **Determine the Minimum Rotation**:
   To find the minimum angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position, we need to consider the smallest angle that will align the pentagon with its starting orientation. Since the pentagon has 5 sides, it will coincide with its original position after a rotation that is a multiple of the central angle.

   The minimum angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position is:
   \[
   360^\circ
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   The minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is:

   \boxed{360}

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and then determine the value of \(x + y\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
1. \(\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6\)
2. \(\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}\)

Let's solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's solve the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Now, we need to find the correct value of \(x\) that satisfies \(x > 7\). Since the midpoint of the other diagonal must be the same, we can use the fact that the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices of a parallelogram is equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of the midpoints of the diagonals. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices is twice the x-coordinate of the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
5 + 7 + x + 6 = 2 \times 6 \implies 18 + x = 12 \implies x = -6
\]

However, this is not a valid solution since \(x > 7\). Let's use the fact that the sum of the x-coordinates of the vertices is equal to the sum of the x-coordinates of the midpoints of the diagonals:
\[
5 + 7 + x + 6 = 2 \times 6 \implies 18 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Therefore, the correct value of \(x\) is:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now, we can find the value of \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 6 + 5 = 11
\]

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",17,"[17, '17']",False

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting the denominator equal to zero, we get:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
For \( x = 7 \), the numerator is \( 2(7) = 14 \), which is not zero.
For \( x = -2 \), the numerator is \( 2(-2) = -4 \), which is not zero.
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator \( P(x) = 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

holds for all bidimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of a single tree and a single goole in terms of the weight of a single squig, and then find the weight of a combination of tree and goole that is equal to the weight of a single squig.

First, let's define the weights:
- Let the weight of a single squig be \( S \).
- Let the weight of a single tree be \( T \).
- Let the weight of a single goole be \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Three squigs and one goole weigh the same as two squigs and one goole. This can be written as:
   \[
   3S + G = 2S + G
   \]
   Subtracting \( 2S + G \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   S = 0
   \]
   This result seems incorrect because it implies that a squig has no weight, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that two tree and one goole weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

2. Two squigs and one goole weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2S + G = S
   \]
   Subtracting \( S \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   S + G = 0
   \]
   This result also seems incorrect because it implies that a squig and a goole have opposite weights, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that two tree and one goole weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

3. Two squigs and one goole weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2S + G = S
   \]
   Subtracting \( S \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   S + G = 0
   \]
   This result also seems incorrect because it implies that a squig and a goole have opposite weights, which is not possible. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that two tree and one goole weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

From the correct interpretation, we have:
\[
2T + G = S
\]

We need to find the weight of a combination of tree and goole that is equal to the weight of a single squig. Let's assume the combination is \( x \) tree and \( y \) goole. The weight of this combination is:
\[
xT + yG
\]
We need this to be equal to the weight of a single squig, \( S \):
\[
xT + yG = S
\]

From the equation \( 2T + G = S \), we can see that if \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 1 \), then:
\[
2T + 1G = S
\]
This is the same as the equation \( 2T + G = S \). Therefore, the combination of 2 tree and 1 goole is equal to the weight of a single squig.

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form should match the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

First, we expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
We distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]
By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Solving for \(b\):
\[
3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substituting \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
\]
By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \implies -10 - 6 = -16 \implies -16 = -16
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. By comparing the constant terms, we get:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
Substituting \(a = -3\):
\[
-2(-3) = 6 \implies 6 = 6
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]
Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical dipòsit, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the volume of water is increasing and the rate at which the water level is rising.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or depth) of the water in the cylinder.

We are given that the volume of water is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the radius \( r \), we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the dipòsit is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin \((0,0)\). For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(ax^2\), which is a parabola starting at \((a, a^3)\) and opening upwards.

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). The line passes through the point \((a, 3a)\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must not lie entirely below the line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). Specifically, the minimum value of the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the value of the line \(ax + 2a\) at \(x = a\).

The minimum value of the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). The value of the line \(ax + 2a\) at \(x = a\) is \(3a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq 3a. \]
Assuming \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[ a^2 \leq 3. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} \leq a \leq \sqrt{3}. \]
Since \(a\) must be positive (otherwise the function would not be defined as given), we have:
\[ 0 < a \leq \sqrt{3}. \]
The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this inequality is \(\sqrt{3}\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{3}}. \]","[sqrt(3), '\\sqrt{3}']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(a\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) such that \(a \neq f(a)\), we need to analyze the fixed points of \(f\) and the behavior of \(f\) around these fixed points.

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\). A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ (\lambda - 1)x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x((\lambda - 1) - \lambda x) = 0. \]

So, the fixed points are:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x = 0\) to be a valid fixed point, it must be in the interval \([0,1]\), which it is. For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be a valid fixed point, it must also be in the interval \([0,1]\), which it is if \(\lambda > 1\).

Now, we need to check the behavior of \(f\) around these fixed points. The derivative of \(f\) is:

\[ f'(x) = \lambda (1 - 2x). \]

At \(x = 0\), the derivative is:

\[ f'(0) = \lambda. \]

At \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), the derivative is:

\[ f'\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - 2 \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - 2 + \frac{2}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(-1 + \frac{2}{\lambda}\right) = -\lambda + 2. \]

For \(f\) to have a point \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), the derivative at one of the fixed points must be \(-1\). Therefore, we need:

\[ \lambda = 2. \]

For \(\lambda = 2\), the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The derivative at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[ f'\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = -2 + 2 = 0. \]

However, we need to check if there is a point \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's consider \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):

\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}, \]
\[ f(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)) = f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}. \]

So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point, not a point where \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Therefore, the correct value of \(\lambda\) is:

\[ \boxed{2}. \]","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) and is the smallest positive angle is:
\[
\theta = 180^\circ - 60^\circ = 120^\circ.
\]

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher powers of 5 will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) on the domain \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we start by analyzing the function and its partial derivatives.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \(x = 1\) or \(x = -1\), then \(y = 0\) to maximize the term \(x \sqrt{1 - y^2}\). Similarly, if \(y = 1\) or \(y = -1\), then \(x = 0\) to maximize the term \(y \sqrt{1 - x^2}\). Therefore, we need to evaluate \(f(x, y)\) at the points \((1, 0)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 1)\), and \((0, -1)\).

1. At \((1, 0)\):
   \[
   f(1, 0) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1.
   \]

2. At \((-1, 0)\):
   \[
   f(-1, 0) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1.
   \]

3. At \((0, 1)\):
   \[
   f(0, 1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1.
   \]

4. At \((0, -1)\):
   \[
   f(0, -1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1.
   \]

From these evaluations, we see that the maximum value of \(f(x, y)\) on the boundary is 1.

Next, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the domain \(-1 < x, y < 1\). We do this by finding the partial derivatives of \(f(x, y)\) and setting them to zero.

The partial derivative with respect to \(x\) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]

The partial derivative with respect to \(y\) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \(y^2\):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^4.
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \(x^2\):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^4.
\]

Since both equations are identical, we can equate them. This implies that \(x^2 = y^2\). Substituting \(y^2 = x^2\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 x^2,
\]
\[
(1 - x^2)^2 = x^4,
\]
\[
1 - 2x^2 + x^4 = x^4,
\]
\[
1 - 2x^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{1}{2},
\]
\[
x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]

Since \(y^2 = x^2\), we also have \(y = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). Therefore, the critical points are \(\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\), \(\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\), and \(\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\).

Evaluating \(f(x, y)\) at these points, we get:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1,
\]
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = 0,
\]
\[
f\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 0,
\]
\[
f\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \sqrt{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \sqrt{1 - \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2} = \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -1.
\]

From these evaluations, we see that the maximum value of \(f(x, y)\) inside the domain is also 1.

Therefore, the maximum value of \(f(x, y)\) on the domain \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
The cross product is calculated as follows:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies the equation \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is the positive root, we have:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}. \]

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Using the identity for the cosine of a multiple angle, we know that \( \cos 85\theta \) can be expressed in terms of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \cos 85\theta \) is periodic with period 10, because \( \cos 10\theta = \cos 0 = 1 \) and \( \cos 9\theta = \cos 9\theta \). Therefore, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos 5\theta \).

We can find \( \cos 5\theta \) using the multiple angle formula for cosine:

\[ \cos 5\theta = 16 \cos^5 \theta - 20 \cos^3 \theta + 5 \cos \theta. \]

Substituting \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \), we get:

\[ \cos 5\theta = 16 \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \right)^5 - 20 \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \right)^3 + 5 \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \right). \]

After simplifying, we find that:

\[ \cos 5\theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{4} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2}. \]

The final answer is:

"To find the area of triangle \(ENG\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle and its medians.

1. **Identify the properties of the medians and the centroid:**
   - The medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) of triangle \(ABC\) intersect at the centroid \(G\).
   - The centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

2. **Determine the position of points \(M\) and \(N\):**
   - The line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\).

3. **Use the properties of similar triangles:**
   - Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.
   - The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the medians. Since \(G\) divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, the ratio of the sides of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is \(1:3\).

4. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AMN\):**
   - The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.
   - Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).
   - Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16\).

5. **Determine the area of triangle \(ENG\):**
   - The centroid \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) into segments \(AG\) and \(GD\) in a 2:1 ratio.
   - The area of triangle \(EGN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\) because \(G\) divides the median in a 2:1 ratio and \(N\) is on \(AC\).
   - Therefore, the area of triangle \(EGN\) is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 16 = \frac{16}{3}\).

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

So, the factors of 100 are: \(1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100\).

This equation implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \) because the exponents must match when the bases are the same. Therefore, we need to find the smallest \( n \) such that \( n \) is a divisor of \( 24 \).

The divisors of \( 24 \) are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude \( 1 \) from the list. The smallest divisor greater than \( 1 \) is \( 2 \).

Thus, the smallest integer \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is:

"To determine how many nickels the person has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( q \) be the number of quarters.
- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( q + d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 25q + 10d + 5n = 75 \) (since each quarter is worth 25 cents, each dime is worth 10 cents, and each nickel is worth 5 cents)

We need to solve this system of equations step by step. First, let's eliminate one of the variables. We can start by eliminating \( d \). To do this, we can express \( d \) in terms of \( q \) and \( n \) from the first equation:
\[ d = 11 - q - n \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 25q + 10(11 - q - n) + 5n = 75 \]

Now, we simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 25q + 110 - 10q - 10n + 5n = 75 \]
\[ 15q - 5n + 110 = 75 \]

Next, we isolate the terms involving \( q \) and \( n \) by subtracting 110 from both sides:
\[ 15q - 5n = 75 - 110 \]
\[ 15q - 5n = -35 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 3q - n = -7 \]

Now, we solve for \( n \):
\[ n = 3q + 7 \]

Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer, \( q \) must be such that \( 3q + 7 \geq 0 \). Additionally, \( q \) must be a non-negative integer and the total number of coins \( q + d + n = 11 \) must be satisfied. Let's test possible values for \( q \):

If \( q = 0 \):
\[ n = 3(0) + 7 = 7 \]
\[ d = 11 - 0 - 7 = 4 \]
\[ 25(0) + 10(4) + 5(7) = 0 + 40 + 35 = 75 \]
This solution works.

If \( q = 1 \):
\[ n = 3(1) + 7 = 10 \]
\[ d = 11 - 1 - 10 = 0 \]
\[ 25(1) + 10(0) + 5(10) = 25 + 0 + 50 = 75 \]
This solution works.

If \( q = 2 \):
\[ n = 3(2) + 7 = 13 \]
\[ d = 11 - 2 - 13 = -4 \]
This solution does not work because \( d \) cannot be negative.

Therefore, the possible solutions are \( (q, d, n) = (0, 4, 7) \) or \( (q, d, n) = (1, 0, 10) \). Since the problem asks for the number of nickels, the possible values are 7 or 10. However, the problem does not specify which solution is correct, so we can conclude that the number of nickels is either 7 or 10.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we first need to identify the set of the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to determine the parity (odd or even) of each of these numbers:
- 2 is even.
- 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are odd.

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In this case, since there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13), the only way to get an even sum is for both Paul and Jesse to choose odd numbers.

Now, we calculate the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers. There are 5 odd numbers out of the 6 prime numbers, so the probability that Paul chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\). Similarly, the probability that Jesse chooses an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\).

Since the choices are independent, the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the numbers that Paul and Jesse choose is even is \(\boxed{\frac{25}{36}}\).","[25/36, '\\frac{25}{36}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False

"To determine the area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of the rectangle and then subtract the areas of the unshaded quadrats.

First, let's find the area of the entire rectangle. The rectangle is formed by 5 columns and 4 rows, so the dimensions of the rectangle are 5 units by 4 units. The area of the rectangle is:
\[

Next, we need to find the area of the unshaded quadrats. There are two unshaded quadrats, each with a side length of 1 unit. The area of one quadrat is:

Since there are two unshaded quadrats, the total area of the unshaded quadrats is:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that has all digits as zeros and ones, we need to consider the properties of the number 450 and the constraints given. Let's start by factoring 450:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. This means the number must end in 00 (to be divisible by 2 and 5), and the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9 (to be divisible by 9).

Given that the number must have all digits as zeros and ones, the only way to satisfy the divisibility by 9 is to have a sum of digits equal to 9. Therefore, the number must contain exactly 9 ones and the rest zeros.

The smallest number that meets these criteria is the one with the ones in the least significant positions, which is 11111111100. This number has 9 ones and 2 zeros, and it ends in 00, making it divisible by 450.

To verify, we can check the divisibility:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2 and 5.
- The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), so it is divisible by 9.

Since 11111111100 is divisible by 2, 9, and 5, it is divisible by 450.

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to its decimal form.

First, let's calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Note that the leading zeros after the decimal point do not contribute to the sum.

So, the sum of the digits is:
\[2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14\]

Therefore, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Therefore, the original expression is:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-30^\circ) = -\sin 30^\circ = -\frac{1}{2}\), we have:

\[
\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}.
\]

Thus, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

However, we can use another identity for the product of tangents of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 3 + 9 = 12.

"To determine the number of sides of the convex polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \). Let the measure of the missing angle be \( x \). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is \( 1070^\circ + x \). Using the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since \( x \) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we have:

\[
180(n-2) < 1070 + 180
\]

Simplifying the right side of the inequality, we get:

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \) by dividing both sides by 180:

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 < \frac{125}{18} \approx 6.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[
n-2 \leq 6
\]

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

\[
n \leq 8
\]

Now, we need to check if \( n = 8 \) is a valid solution. If \( n = 8 \), the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080^\circ
\]

So, the missing angle \( x \) is:

\[
x = 1080 - 1070 = 10^\circ
\]

Since \( x = 10^\circ \) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, \( n = 8 \) is indeed the correct number of sides. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

"To find the unique \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:

\[ (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to determine if 2 is a quadratic residue modulo 23. We do this by checking if there exists an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test the integers from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution, and \( x = -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) is also a solution. Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 = -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the unique \( t \) in the interval \( 0 < t < 23 \) is:

\[ \boxed{4} \] or \[ \boxed{17} \] \]

However, since the problem asks for the unique \( t \), we need to check which one satisfies the original condition. Both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) satisfy the condition, but the problem does not specify which one to choose. Therefore, the correct answer is:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.

and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1\):

\[

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[

\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(D\) between the two lines is:

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[

"To find the mean price of Juan's stamps from the 70s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of stamps and their prices for each decade.
2. Calculate the total number of stamps.
3. Calculate the total cost of all the stamps.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to get the mean price.

Let's start with the data from the table:

- In the 70s, Juan bought 12 stamps of 6 cèntims each.
- In the 70s, Juan bought 12 stamps of 6 cèntims each.
- In the 70s, Juan bought 8 stamps of 13 cèntims each.

Now, let's calculate the total number of stamps:
\[ 12 + 12 + 8 = 32 \]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of all the stamps:
\[ 12 \times 6 + 12 \times 6 + 8 \times 13 = 72 + 72 + 104 = 248 \text{ cèntims} \]

Now, we divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to get the mean price:
\[ \text{Mean price} = \frac{248}{32} = 7.75 \text{ cèntims} \]

Therefore, the mean price of Juan's stamps from the 70s is \(\boxed{7.8}\) cèntims (rounded to the nearest tenth).","[7.80000000000000, '7.8']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{d}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \angle BAC
\]
The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD \cdot \sin \angle ACD
\]
Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\sin \angle ACD = 1\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) simplifies to:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \angle BAC
\]
Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\sin \angle BAC = \sin \angle CAD\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be written as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \angle BAC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \angle CAD
\]

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD]
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are proportional to the lengths of \(AB\) and \(CD\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{c}{a+c} \cdot [ABCD]
\]

Given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{c}{a+c} \cdot 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

   This simplifies to:
   \[

4. **Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by \(-19\):**
   \[

\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points on the circle.

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be in one of the two alternating patterns mentioned above. There are exactly 2 such patterns for any given arrangement of the points on the circle.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi
   \]

4. **Determine the area of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded:**
   The area of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the shaded region:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = A_{\text{large}} - A_{\text{shaded}} = 4\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{12\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **Relate the area of the sector to the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2
   \]
   where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees. For the larger circle, the radius \(r\) is 2, so the area of the sector is:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi
   \]
   We know that \(A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{7\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{7\pi}{3}
   \]
   To solve for \(\theta\), we can divide both sides by \(\pi\) and then multiply by 360:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4 = \frac{7}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \theta \cdot 4 = \frac{7}{3} \cdot 360^\circ

   \[
   \theta \cdot 4 = 840^\circ

   \theta = \frac{840^\circ}{4} = 210^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical vessels are needed to fill a spherical dipotamus, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical vessels and the spherical dipotamus, and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical dipotamus to the volume of one cylindrical vessel.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical dipotamus. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical dipotamus, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting the value of \( r \) into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical vessel. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For one cylindrical vessel, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical vessels are needed to fill the spherical dipotamus, we divide the volume of the spherical dipotamus by the volume of one cylindrical vessel:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical vessels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - 2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin (A + B) \sin (A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2A) - \cos (2B)].
\]
Substituting \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\), we get:
\[
\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) - \cos (2 \arcsin 0.5)].
\]
Next, we use the double-angle identity for cosine:
\[
\cos (2 \arcsin x) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 (\arcsin x) = 1 - 2x^2.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) = 1 - 2 (0.4)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68,
\]
\[
\cos (2 \arcsin 0.5) = 1 - 2 (0.5)^2 = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.
\]
Substituting these values back into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) - \cos (2 \arcsin 0.5)] = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomitè of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcomitès and then subtracting the number of subcomitès that do not meet the criteria (i.e., subcomitès that are all Republicans or all Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcomitè of 5 members from the 14 members of the Senat (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of subcomitès that are all Republicans. There are 8 Republicans, so the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of subcomitès that are all Democrats. There are 6 Democrats, so the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats is:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

Now, add the number of all-Republican and all-Democratic subcomitès to get the total number of subcomitès that do not include at least one member from each party:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we know that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]
So, we can write the second equation as:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24.\]
Since \(x+1 \neq 0\) (because \(x\) is an integer and \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\)), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[x(x+2) = 24.\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[x^2 + 2x = 24.\]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0.\]
We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(6\) and \(-4\). Therefore, we can write:
\[(x + 6)(x - 4) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:
\[x + 6 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 4 = 0.\]
So, the solutions are:
\[x = -6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4.\]
Since we are looking for the three consecutive integers, we consider both cases:

1. If \(x = 4\), then the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\).
2. If \(x = -6\), then the three consecutive integers are \(-6\), \(-5\), and \(-4\).

\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

In our case, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{AB}.
\]
Since \( BM = \frac{BC}{2} \), we can express \( BM \) in terms of \( AB \) and \( \theta \):
\[
BM = AB \cos \theta.
\]

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = \frac{DM}{BD} = \frac{1}{BD} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 3\theta = \frac{BM}{BD}.
\]
Using the triple angle identities for sine and cosine, we get:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \quad \text{and} \quad \cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta.
\]
Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \) and \( \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right) - 4 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^3 = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{4 \cdot 1331}{AB^3} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{5324}{AB^3}

and
\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \left( \frac{BM}{AB} \right)^3 - 3 \left( \frac{BM}{AB} \right) = 4 \left( \frac{AB \cos \theta}{AB} \right)^3 - 3 \left( \frac{AB \cos \theta}{AB} \right) = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta.
\]
Since \( \sin 3\theta = \frac{1}{BD} \) and \( \cos 3\theta = \frac{BM}{BD} \), we can use the fact that \( \sin^2 3\theta + \cos^2 3\theta = 1 \) to find \( BD \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \) and the properties of isosceles triangles.

Given the symmetry and the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we can deduce that \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), since \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \) and \( \angle BCD = \angle BAC = 30^\circ \), we have \( \angle DBC = 60^\circ \). This means \( \triangle BDC \) is a 30-60-90 triangle, and the sides are in the ratio \( 1 : \sqrt{3} : 2 \). Since \( DM = 1 \), we have:
\[
BD = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad BC = 2 \sqrt{3}.
\]
Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have:
\[
BM = \frac{BC}{2} = \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB = \frac{AM}{\sin \theta} = \frac{11}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{11}{\frac{1}{2}} = 22.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[
AC = 22.
\]
The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 22 + 22 + 2 \sqrt{3} = 44 + 2 \sqrt{3}.

\[ S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) \]

where \(a\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the number of terms. For a sequence of 27 consecutive integers, \(n = 27\), \(d = 1\), and the sum \(S = 3^7 = 2187\). Plugging these values into the sum formula, we get:

\[ 2187 = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) \]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we have:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[
s^3 = 64,

\[
s = 4.

Now, substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:

"To determine for which course the number of homes that utilize the auto bus is more proper to \(135\%\) of the number of dones that utilize the auto bus, we need to calculate the ratio of homes to dones for each course and then compare these ratios to \(135\%\).

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

Next, we need to determine the intervals where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the denominator are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37 > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 18\). Then \(x(x-36) = 18(18-36) = 18(-18) = -324 < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37 > 0\).

Therefore, the expression \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also consider the points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). At these points, the numerator is zero, so the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is zero, not negative. Therefore, these points are not included in the solution set.

"To find the maximum area of the rectangular camp, we need to consider the dimensions of the rectangle and the semicircles. The pista consists of a rectangle with two semicircles on either end. The total length of the pista is the sum of the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle plus the diameter of the semicircles.

Given that the total length of the pista is 400 meters, we can express this as:
\[ 2 \times \text{length of the rectangle} + \pi \times \text{diameter of the semicircle} = 400 \]
Since the diameter of the semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle, we can let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) and the width be \( W \). Therefore, the equation becomes:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

The area \( A \) of the camp is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semicircles, which is equivalent to the area of the rectangle plus the area of one full circle:
\[ A = L \times W + \pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right)^2 = L \times W + \pi \frac{W^2}{4} \]

We can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) using the perimeter equation:
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this into the area equation, we get:
\[ A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi W}{2}\right) W + \pi \frac{W^2}{4} = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W}{2} - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0 \]
\[ 200 = \frac{\pi W}{2} \]
\[ W = \frac{400}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{400}{\pi}\right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 400}{2} = 0 \]

This result indicates that the maximum area is achieved when the length of the rectangle is 0, which means the width is the entire 400 meters. Therefore, the maximum area of the camp is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R}\) is given as \(\frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) means that the length of the side opposite to angle \(R\) is 2 and the hypotenuse is 5.

Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle \(T\) as \(a\) and the length of the hypotenuse as \(c\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the side opposite to angle \(T\) is the same as the side adjacent to angle \(R\), and the hypotenuse is the same as the hypotenuse of the triangle. Therefore, the side adjacent to angle \(R\) is 2, and the hypotenuse is 5.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the side opposite to angle \(T\):

\[

\[

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \]
Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}. \]
Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}. \]
To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root, which is:
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}. \]
We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0. \]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}, \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}, \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}. \]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by understanding the structure of the octahedron and the given distances. A regular octahedron has 8 equilateral triangle faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices can be paired such that each pair is connected by an edge, and the pairs are opposite to each other.

Given the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to determine the distance to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) such that \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, \( B \) and \( E \) are opposite, and \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite. Without loss of generality, assume the distances are \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), and \( PE = 11 \). We need to find \( PF \).

Since \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, the distance \( AF \) is the longest diagonal of the octahedron. The distance between any two opposite vertices of a regular octahedron with edge length \( a \) is \( a\sqrt{2} \). The distance between any two adjacent vertices is \( a \).

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron is constant. For a regular octahedron, this sum is given by:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 4 \left( \frac{3a^2}{2} \right) = 6a^2 \]

"To find the common digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[

   - Each bruixie can give a pastry to any bruixot.

   - Each bruixie can only give a pastry to one bruixot.
   - Each bruixot can only give a pastry to one bruixie.

3. **Determine the number of possible matches:**
   - Since each bruixie can give a pastry to any bruixot and each bruixot can give a pastry to any bruixie, the problem reduces to finding the number of ways to pair 5 bruixies with 5 bruixots.

Factoring out \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\), we get:

Thus, we have:

"To determine the last digit to the right of the decimal point in the expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the fraction**: First, we simplify \(\frac{137}{500}\). Since 137 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 500 other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

2. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**: To convert \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division \(137 \div 500\).

   \[
   137 \div 500 = 0.274
   \]

3. **Identify the digits to the right of the decimal point**: The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4.

4. **Find the last digit to the right of the decimal point**: The last digit to the right of the decimal point in \(0.274\) is 4.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is more than a certain distance from the center \(O\) than from any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions defined by these distances.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides of the rectangle as \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\), with \(a = kb\) where \(k\) is a given constant. The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the midpoint of both \(AB\) and \(AD\), so \(O\) is at \((0,0)\) if we place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a/2, b/2)\), \(B = (a/2, b/2)\), \(C = (a/2, -b/2)\), and \(D = (-a/2, -b/2)\).

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance from a point \(P = (x, y)\) to \(O\) is greater than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(O, P) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is:
\[
d(A, P) = \sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(B\) is:
\[
d(B, P) = \sqrt{(x - a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(C\) is:
\[
d(C, P) = \sqrt{(x - a/2)^2 + (y + b/2)^2}
\]
The distance from \(P\) to \(D\) is:
\[
d(D, P) = \sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y + b/2)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} > \sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 > x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
0 > ax - by + \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax - by > \frac{a^2}{4} + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]
\[
ax - by > \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \quad \text{(for vertex } A\text{)}
\]
\[
ax - by > \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \quad \text{(for vertex } B\text{)}
\]
\[
ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \quad \text{(for vertex } C\text{)}
\]
\[
ax - by > \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \quad \text{(for vertex } D\text{)}
\]

These inequalities define four regions inside the rectangle, each of which is a right triangle with vertices at \(O\), \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The area of each triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of each triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{2} \times \frac{b}{2} = \frac{ab}{8}
\]

Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the region where the point is more than a certain distance from all four vertices is:
\[
\text{Total area} = 4 \times \frac{ab}{8} = \frac{ab}{2}
\]

The area of the rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = ab
\]

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is more than a certain distance from the center \(O\) than from any of the four vertices is:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area of the rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{2}}{ab} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the answer is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many diners, in cents, van quedar després de convertir tantes monedes en bitllets com van poder, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected from the sales.
2. Convert the total amount of money into cents.
3. Determine how many diners, in cents, can be converted with the total amount of money.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected from the sales:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Linda's amount} + \text{Sherry's amount} + \text{June's amount} + \text{Connie's amount}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52

\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

\[

\]

So, the total amount of money collected is $126.59.

Next, we convert the total amount into cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given \( 4 \times 4 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = 3n + 3
\]

Since this sum is the same for each row, column, and diagonal, we can use this sum to find the value of \( n \). Let's consider the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 2 + (n) = 4n - 5
\]

For the square to be magic, the sum of the second row must equal the sum of the first row:

\[
4n - 5 = 3n + 3
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
4n - 3n = 3 + 5
\]
\[
n = 8

To verify, we can substitute \( n = 8 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

"To determine how many more peus Jim camina than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim walks diagonally through the rectangular camp. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} \]
For Jim, the length is 400 peus and the width is 300 peus. Therefore, the distance Jim travels is:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ peus} \]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
