"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the distance \(EF\) is simply the difference in their y-coordinates, which is \(7 - 0 = 7\) units. This confirms the given information.

Next, we need to find the distance \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\), we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( z \) is rotated by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)

   Distribute the terms:
   \[

   Since \( i^2 = -1 \):
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

4. **Translate the rotated complex number back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) back to the rotated complex number:

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. Since \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), we have:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many atoms are required to produce one mole of each gas: helium (He), oxygen (O2), and nitrogen (N2). We will use the molar masses of these gases to find the number of atoms.

1. **Calculate the number of atoms in one mole of helium (He):**
   - The molar mass of helium is 4.00 g/mol.
   - One mole of helium contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) atoms (Avogadro's number).
   - Therefore, the number of atoms in one mole of helium is \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\).

2. **Calculate the number of atoms in one mole of oxygen (O2):**
   - The molar mass of oxygen is 32.00 g/mol.
   - One mole of oxygen contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules.
   - Each molecule of oxygen contains 2 atoms.
   - Therefore, the number of atoms in one mole of oxygen is \(2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.2044 \times 10^{24}\).

3. **Calculate the number of atoms in one mole of nitrogen (N2):**
   - The molar mass of nitrogen is 28.01 g/mol.
   - One mole of nitrogen contains \(6.022 \times 10^{23}\) molecules.
   - Each molecule of nitrogen contains 2 atoms.
   - Therefore, the number of atoms in one mole of nitrogen is \(2 \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} = 1.2044 \times 10^{24}\).

Now, we need to find the total number of atoms required to produce one mole of each gas:

- Oxygen: \(1.2044 \times 10^{24}\) atoms
- Nitrogen: \(1.2044 \times 10^{24}\) atoms

Adding these together, we get:
\[6.022 \times 10^{23} + 1.2044 \times 10^{24} + 1.2044 \times 10^{24} = 6.022 \times 10^{23} + 2.4088 \times 10^{24} = 2.47902 \times 10^{24}\]

"To find the term that contains \(x^3\) in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term where the power of \(x\) is 3. The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k

Simplifying the general term, we get:

\[

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be 3, so we set up the equation:

\[

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[
12 = 5k \implies k = \frac{12}{5}

"To determine if \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we start by substituting \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). This gives us:

\[
n + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

We need to check if the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7. Substituting the expressions above, we get:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since each term in the product contains a factor of 7 except for the constant terms 4, 6, and 8, we can see that the product is not divisible by 7 because none of the terms \(7k + 4\), \(7k + 6\), or \(7k + 8\) is divisible by 7. To confirm, let's expand the product:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) = 7k(7k + 6)(7k + 8) + 4(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

The first term \(7k(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\) is clearly divisible by 7. However, the second term \(4(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\) is not divisible by 7 because 4 is not divisible by 7 and neither \(7k + 6\) nor \(7k + 8\) is divisible by 7. Therefore, the entire product is not divisible by 7.

The incenter is equidistant from all the sides of the pentagon, not the vertices. However, the problem asks for the minimum number of sides of the pentagon that must be closer to the incenter than to the other sides.

Since the incenter is equidistant from all the sides, all five sides of the pentagon are equidistant from the incenter. Therefore, the minimum number of sides that must be closer to the incenter than to the other sides is 0.

"To determine the value of \( x + y \) given the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) with \( x > 7 \), we need to identify the pattern or rule that defines the relationship between \( x \) and \( y \) based on the given points.

First, let's list the given points and their corresponding values:
- For \((5, 3)\), the value is \( 5 + 3 = 8 \).
- For \((6, 8)\), the value is \( 6 + 8 = 14 \).
- For \((7, 4)\), the value is \( 7 + 4 = 11 \).

From these points, we can see that the value of \( x + y \) is not a simple linear function of \( x \) alone. However, we can observe that the value of \( x + y \) is not consistent for all \( x \) values. Therefore, we need to find a pattern or rule that fits the given points and then use it to find the value of \( x + y \) for \( x > 7 \).

Since the problem does not provide a clear pattern or rule, we can assume that the value of \( x + y \) for \( x > 7 \) is not necessarily consistent with the given points. However, if we assume that the value of \( x + y \) for \( x > 7 \) is the same as the value of \( x + y \) for the next integer \( x \) after 7, we can use the value of \( x + y \) for \( x = 8 \) as an example.

If we assume that the value of \( x + y \) for \( x = 8 \) is the same as the value of \( x + y \) for \( x = 7 \), then the value of \( x + y \) for \( x = 8 \) would be 11.

Therefore, the value of \( x + y \) for \( x > 7 \) is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"To find the value of \(\tan A\) given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) in a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

\]

Given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute this into the definition of the tangent function:

\tan A = \frac{2 \cos A}{\cos A}
\]

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (because \(\cos A\) is the cosine of an angle in a right triangle, and the cosine of an angle is never zero unless the angle is \(90^\circ\), but \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) so \(\angle A\) cannot be \(90^\circ\)), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same point. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{At } x = 7, \text{ the numerator is } 2(7) = 14 \neq 0. \]
\[ \text{At } x = -2, \text{ the numerator is } 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

### Step 3: Identify \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)
From the vertical asymptotes, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \). From the horizontal asymptote, we have \( c = 0 \).

### Step 4: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can start by simplifying the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1.\]

Notice that \(99\) can be expressed as \(100 - 1\). So, we can substitute \(99\) with \(100 - 1\) in the expression:
\[(100 - 1)^2 + (100 - 1) + 1.\]

Next, we expand \((100 - 1)^2\):
\[(100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.\]

Now, substitute this back into the expression:
\[9801 + (100 - 1) + 1.\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[9801 + 100 - 1 + 1 = 9801 + 100.\]

Finally, add the numbers together:
\[9801 + 100 = 9901.\]

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[

\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16)

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to obtain:

\[

Thus, we have:

\[

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53\]
So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9
To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), so \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of treeks that is equal to the sum of the number of squigs and the number of goolees, and then find the ratio of the total number of treeks to the number of squigs.

Let's denote the number of treeks by \( T \), the number of squigs by \( S \), and the number of goolees by \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. \( T = S + G \)

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of revolutions the wheel makes and the number of additional revolutions after the speed is increased. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - Initial speed of the wheel: \(20\pi\) revolutions per hour.
   - Initial number of revolutions: 1.

2. **Final Conditions:**
   - Final speed of the wheel: \(20\pi \times 2 = 40\pi\) revolutions per hour (since the speed is increased by a factor of 2).
   - Final number of revolutions: \(1 + x\) (where \(x\) is the additional number of revolutions).

3. **Time Relationship:**
   - The time taken to reach the final speed is the same for both initial and final conditions. Let's denote this time by \(t\) hours.
   - The initial speed is \(20\pi\) revolutions per hour, so the time \(t\) can be expressed as:
     \[
     t = \frac{\text{initial number of revolutions} \times \text{initial speed}}{\text{total revolutions}} = \frac{1 \times 20\pi}{20\pi} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]
   - The final speed is \(40\pi\) revolutions per hour, so the time \(t\) can also be expressed as:
     \[
     t = \frac{\text{final number of revolutions} \times \text{final speed}}{\text{total revolutions}} = \frac{(1 + x) \times 40\pi}{40\pi} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - Since the time \(t\) is the same in both cases, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1 \times 20\pi}{20\pi} = \frac{(1 + x) \times 40\pi}{40\pi}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides, we get:
     \[
     1 = 1 + x

   - Solving for \(x\), we get:

"To determine the value of \(a\) for which the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is tangent to the x-axis at some point, we need to find the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) has a minimum value of 0. The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as follows:

\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's analyze the function on each piece separately.

1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of this parabola occurs at \(x = a\), and the value is \(f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3\).

2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). The value of this function as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left is \(f(a^-) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to be tangent to the x-axis at some point, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) must be 0. Since the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), we need \(a^3 = 0\). This implies that \(a = 0\).

However, if \(a = 0\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which is a constant function and not tangent to the x-axis at any point. Therefore, we need to consider the case where the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is 0. This means \(a^2 + 2a = 0\). Factoring out \(a\), we get \(a(a + 2) = 0\). This gives us two solutions: \(a = 0\) (which we already discard) and \(a = -2\).

Thus, the value of \(a\) that makes the graph of \(y = f(x)\) tangent to the x-axis at some point is \(\boxed{-2}\).","[-2, '-2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This equation has two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x = 0\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), it is always true. For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:

\[ 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1. \]

Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is true if \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is true if:

\[ \lambda - 1 \le \lambda, \]
\[ -1 \le 0, \]

which is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, but not a fixed point. Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]

Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x, \]
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1. \]

Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):

\[ \lambda^4 x^3 - 2\lambda^3 x^2 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 1 - \lambda^2 = 0. \]

For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) to this equation, the discriminant of the cubic equation must be non-negative.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3}) = -60^\circ + 180^\circ k\) for any integer \(k\). The principal value in the range \([0^\circ, 180^\circ)\) is:

The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, S, where the letter L appears twice and the letter S appears twice.

The phrase ""λέξης ELLIPSE"" is a phrase where the letters are arranged in a specific order, and we need to count the number of distinct permutations of the letters in the phrase. Since the phrase is a phrase, the order of the letters matters, and we need to account for the repeated letters.

The word ""ELLIPSE"" has 8 letters, with the letter L appearing twice and the letter S appearing twice. Therefore, the number of distinct permutations of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset:

Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \alpha \), we can consider \( z \) to be a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \alpha z + 1 = 0 \). Solving this quadratic equation, we get:

However, we do not need to find the exact values of \( z \) to solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Instead, we use the fact that \( z \) satisfies \( z^2 = \alpha z - 1 \).

z^{n+6} + \frac{1}{z^{n+6}} = (z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2})(z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4}) - (z^3 + \frac{1}{z^3}) = (\alpha - 1)(3 - 2\alpha) - (1 - \alpha) = 3\alpha - 2\alpha^2 - 3 + 2\alpha - \alpha + 1 = 4\alpha - 2(\alpha + 1) - 2 = 4\alpha - 2\alpha - 2 - 2 = 2\alpha - 4.
\]
Thus, the sequence is indeed periodic with a period of 6. Therefore, we have:
\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^{6 \cdot 14 + 1} + \frac{1}{z^{6 \cdot 14 + 1}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of triangle \(ABC\) given that the area of triangle \(GBC\) is 144, where \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\).

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). This is because the centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area.

Let the area of triangle \(ABC\) be \(A\). Since the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), we have:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle GBC = \frac{1}{3}A
\]
We are given that the area of triangle \(GBC\) is 144, so we can set up the equation:
\[

"To determine the total number of Greek students who are interested in joining the club, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the two given numbers, 100 and 150. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both of them.

"To determine the smallest integer \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is the \( n \)-th triangular number, we start by recalling the formula for the \( n \)-th triangular number. The \( n \)-th triangular number is given by:

\[
T_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

We need to find the smallest \( n > 1 \) such that:

\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 2^{24}
\]

First, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to clear the fraction:

\[
n(n+1) = 2^{25}
\]

Next, we need to find two consecutive integers whose product is \( 2^{25} \). Since \( 2^{25} \) is a power of 2, the two consecutive integers must be as close to each other as possible. We can estimate \( n \) by taking the square root of \( 2^{25} \):

\[
\sqrt{2^{25}} = 2^{12.5} \approx 4096
\]

So, we test the integers around 4096. Let's try \( n = 4096 \):

\[
n+1 = 4097
\]
\[
n(n+1) = 4096 \times 4097 = 16777216
\]

Since \( 16777216 \neq 33554432 \), \( n = 4096 \) is not the solution. Now, let's try \( n = 4095 \):

\[
n+1 = 4096
\]
\[
n(n+1) = 4095 \times 4096 = 16777215
\]

Since \( 16777215 \neq 33554432 \), \( n = 4095 \) is not the solution either. We need to find the correct \( n \) by solving the quadratic equation:

\[

\]

Using the quadratic formula \( n = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -2^{25} \):

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4 \cdot 2^{25}}}{2}

n = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 2^{27}}}{2}

\[
n = \frac{-1 \pm 11625}{2}

"To determine how many pentagrams η Χίλαρι has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of stellations of the icosahedron.
2. Determine the number of stellations that are pentagrams.
3. Use the information given about the total number of stellations to find the number of pentagrams.

First, we know that the total number of stellations of the icosahedron is 59. Out of these, 32 are stellations of the dodecahedron, 15 are stellations of the icosahedron that are not stellations of the dodecahedron, and the rest are stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahedron. We are also given that the total number of stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahedron is 75.

Let's denote the number of stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahedron as \( P \). According to the problem, \( P = 75 \).

Since the total number of stellations of the icosahedron is the sum of the stellations that are stellations of the dodecahedron and the stellations that are not stellations of the dodecahed, we can write:
\[ \text{Total stellations} = P + \text{Stellations that are not stellations of the dodecahed} \]

We know the total stellations is 59, and the stellations that are not stellations of the dodecahed are 15. Therefore, we can write:
\[ 59 = P + 15 \]

Substituting \( P = 75 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 59 = 75 + 15 \]

This equation is not consistent with the given total number of stellations. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the number of stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahedron is 75, and the total number of stellations is 59. This means that the number of stellations that are not stellations of the dodecahed is 15, and the number of stellations that are stellations of the dodecahed but not the icosahedron is 0.

Thus, the number of stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahed is 75, and the number of stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahed but not the icosahedron is 0.

Therefore, the number of stellations of the icosahedron that are stellations of the dodecahed is 75.

First, let's calculate the area of the entire square:

\]

Next, we need to find the area of one of the smaller triangles. Each smaller triangle has a base of 4 units (the side length of the square) and a height of 2 units (the distance from the corner to the opposite side where the diagonal intersects). The area of a triangle is given by:

"To find the number of divisors of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to determine the prime factorization of the numerator and the denominator.

First, let's factorize 4321. We can check for divisibility by small prime numbers:
- 4321 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 4321 is \(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3, so 4321 is not divisible by 3.
- 4321 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- To check for divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 7 = 617.2857\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 7.
- To check for divisibility by 11, we use the alternating sum of the digits: \(4 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 2\), which is not divisible by 11, so 4321 is not divisible by 11.
- To check for divisibility by 13, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 13 = 332.3846\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 13.
- To check for divisibility by 17, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 17 = 254.1765\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 17.
- To check for divisibility by 19, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 19 = 227.4211\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 19.
- To check for divisibility by 23, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 23 = 187.8696\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 23.
- To check for divisibility by 29, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 29 = 149\), which is an integer, so 4321 is divisible by 29.
- Now, we check if 149 is a prime number. The prime numbers less than \(\sqrt{149} \approx 12.21\) are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. We already know 149 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11. Therefore, 149 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 4321 is \(29 \cdot 149\).

Now, we have the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{29 \cdot 149}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\). The prime factorization of the denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\).

The number of divisors of a number \(n = p_1^{e_1} \cdot p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k}\) is given by \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\). For the fraction \(\frac{29 \cdot 149}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), the exponents of the prime factors in the numerator are 1 and 1, and the exponents of the prime factors in the denominator are 7 and 8. Therefore, the exponents in the simplified form are 1, 1, 7, and 8.

The number of divisors is \((1+1)(1+1)(7+1)(8+1) = 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 8 \cdot 9 = 288\).

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

"To find the minimum angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the polynomial \( f(x) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The polynomial \( g(x) \) is obtained by substituting \( x+5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[ g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015. \]

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( g(r-5) = f((r-5)+5) = f(r) = 0 \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{107}{18}
\]

To convert this to a decimal, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, we have:

\[

First, we rewrite the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By testing values, we find:
\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ (-5)^2 = 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 \equiv -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). We need to check if these values satisfy the original condition \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23:

  \[ t + 2 = 19 \]
  \[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
  So, \( t = 17 \) is a solution.

Next, we need to multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Applying the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.

This simplifies to:

Cross-multiplying gives:

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{h}{2} \left( \frac{ab}{c} + c \right) = 42
\]

To find \([ \triangle ACD ]\), we need to express \(h\) in terms of \(c\). Notice that \(\frac{ab}{c} + c\) is a term that depends on the specific values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), but we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times c \times h\). Since \(\frac{h}{2} \left( \frac{ab}{c} + c \right) = 42\), we can solve for \(h\) in terms of \(c\):
\[
h = \frac{84}{\frac{ab}{c} + c}
\]

Substituting \(h\) into the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times \frac{84}{\frac{ab}{c} + c} = \frac{42c}{\frac{ab}{c} + c} = \frac{42c^2}{ab + c^2}
\]

However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height \(h\) and the bases \(AB\) and \(CD\) are proportional, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric configuration of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on a circle. The key insight is that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

First, let's count the total number of ways to choose the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle. Since the order in which we choose the points matters (because it determines the arrangement around the circle), we use permutations. There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we divide by 4 to account for rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:

\[
\frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6
\]

Next, we count the number of arrangements where the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. As mentioned earlier, this occurs if the points are in an alternating pattern. There are 2 possible alternating patterns for any given set of 4 points: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations). Since there are 6 distinct arrangements of the points, and 2 of these arrangements result in intersecting line segments, the number of favorable outcomes is:

\[
2
\]

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

First, let's find the volume of the larger spherical drop. The diameter of the larger drop is 8 cm, so the radius \( r_1 \) is:

\[ r_1 = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ cm} \]

The volume \( V_1 \) of the larger drop is:

\[ V_1 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (4)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (64) = \frac{256}{3} \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's find the volume of one of the smaller spherical drops. The diameter of the smaller drop is 6 cm, so the radius \( r_2 \) is:

\[ r_2 = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cm} \]

The volume \( V_2 \) of one smaller drop is:

\[ V_2 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

To find out how many smaller drops are needed to replace the larger drop, we divide the volume of the larger drop by the volume of one smaller drop:

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},

\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},

\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

d_1 + d_2 + d_3 = 120
\]

To find the greatest diameter, we need to consider that the sum of the other two diameters is \(120 - d_3\). The greatest diameter will be the one that is as large as possible, which means the other two diameters should be as small as possible. The smallest possible value for a diameter is 0 (assuming the diameters can be arbitrarily small), so let's assume \(d_2 = 0\). Then:

\[
d_1 + 0 + d_3 = 120 \implies d_1 + d_3 = 120
\]

To maximize \(d_1\), we set \(d_3\) to its minimum value, which is 0. Therefore:

\[
d_1 + 0 = 120 \implies d_1 = 120
\]

Thus, the greatest diameter is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \(x = 66\) and \(x = -62\). The final answer is:

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[

\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[

Therefore, the original expression is:

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), and there exists a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\).

First, let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(\angle BMA = 180^\circ - 2\theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) implies that \(\angle BDA = 180^\circ - 3\theta\).

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC}
\]
Since \(\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{BD}{CD} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}
\]

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ABD\), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD}
\]
Since \(\angle BAD = \frac{\theta}{2}\) and \(\angle ABD = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{10}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{10}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
BD = 10 \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
\frac{CD}{\sin \angle CAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ACD}
\]
Since \(\angle CAD = \frac{\theta}{2}\) and \(\angle ACD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\), we get:
\[
\frac{CD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{10}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}} = \frac{10}{\sin \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
CD = 10 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta
\]
\[
\sin \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos 3\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - (4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta)}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta + 1}{2}}
\]

Since \(\sin \theta = \frac{BC}{2 \cdot 11} = \frac{BC}{22}\), we can substitute \(\sin \theta\) and \(\sin \frac{3\theta}{2}\) into the equation for \(CD\):
\[
CD = 10 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin \frac{3\theta}{2}} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta + 1}{2}}} = 10 \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta + 1}}
\]

Using the identity \(\cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{BC}{22}\right)^2}\), we can solve for \(BC\):
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{11}{11} = 1
\]
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{BC}{22} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
BC = 11
\]

Since \(AB = AC\) and \(BC = 11\), the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So, the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). The equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

Next, we use the second given equation:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).

We also use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz,
\]
\[
12 = s p - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = sp - 12,
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),

\[

\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[
s^3 = 64,

\[
s = 4.

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which is always non-negative. The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\), which changes sign at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or when the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator is an absolute value, it is always non-negative, and it is zero only at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality can only be satisfied when the denominator is negative.

The denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\). So, we need to check if the numerator is non-zero in this interval. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is non-zero for \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x\) is in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), it does not include \(x = -9\), so the numerator is non-zero for \(0 < x < 36\) and \(x \neq 9\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the length of the longest diagonal of the rectangle, we start by identifying the dimensions of the rectangle. The problem states that the rectangle has a perimeter of 400 meters and that the diagonals are equal in length. This implies that the rectangle is a square.

Let's denote the length of each side of the square by \( s \). The perimeter of a square is given by the formula:
\[
4s

We know that the perimeter is 400 meters, so we can set up the equation:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

This means that if we let \(RS = 2k\), then \(RT = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\). Since \(T\) is the right angle, \(ST\) is the other leg of the triangle. We can find \(ST\) using the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
ST^2 + RS^2 = RT^2
\]

Substituting the expressions for \(RS\) and \(RT\), we get:

\[
ST^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
\]

Simplifying, we have:

\[
ST^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2

Subtracting \(4k^2\) from both sides, we get:

\[
ST^2 = 21k^2

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

ST = k\sqrt{21}

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:

"To find the value of \(a + b\) where the maximum distance between the arch and the point on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) is given by \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertex of the parabola:**
   The given curve is \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\). This is a parabola that opens upwards with its vertex at \(x = 0\). Substituting \(x = 0\) into the equation, we get:
   \[
   y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   So, the vertex of the parabola is \((0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2})\).

2. **Determine the maximum distance:**
   The maximum distance between the arch and the point on the curve will be the distance from the vertex to the point on the curve. Since the vertex is the lowest point on the parabola, the maximum distance is the distance from the vertex to the point on the curve directly above or below it. This distance is simply the absolute value of the y-coordinate of the vertex:
   \[
   \left| -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right| = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the maximum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{18}}{2}\).

3. **Identify \(a\) and \(b\):**
   From the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{18}}{2}\), we can see that \(a = 18\) and \(b = 2\).

4. **Calculate \(a + b\):**
   \[
   a + b = 18 + 2 = 20

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\ 
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3. 
\end{cases} \]

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us three solutions:
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Solving the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us:
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]
Since \( x = -1 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we discard it. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

The only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ -x = 3 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. We can factor \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 \) as:
\[ -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) \]
Since \( x^2 + 3 \) has no real roots, the only real solution is \( x = 2 \). However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so there are no solutions in this case.

The only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Thus, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance from the point \( P \) to the nearest vertex of the regular octagon. We are given the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the vertices of the octagon as \( A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, \) and \( A_8 \) in a clockwise order, and assume without loss of generality that the distances are \( PA_1 = 3 \), \( PA_2 = 7 \), \( PA_3 = 8 \), \( PA_4 = 9 \), and \( PA_5 = 11 \).

Since the octagon is regular, the distances from \( P \) to the other three vertices \( A_6, A_7, \) and \( A_8 \) are the same as the distances to the vertices \( A_2, A_1, \) and \( A_4 \) respectively, but in a different order.

To find the nearest vertex, we need to determine the minimum of these distances. Let's consider the possible minimum distances:

- If \( PA_6 = 7 \), \( PA_7 = 3 \), and \( PA_8 = 9 \), the minimum is 3.
- If \( PA_6 = 7 \), \( PA_7 = 3 \), and \( PA_8 = 11 \), the minimum is 3.
- If \( PA_6 = 7 \), \( PA_7 = 9 \), and \( PA_8 = 11 \), the minimum is 7.
- If \( PA_6 = 3 \), \( PA_7 = 8 \), and \( PA_8 = 9 \), the minimum is 3.
- If \( PA_6 = 3 \), \( PA_7 = 8 \), and \( PA_8 = 11 \), the minimum is 3.
- If \( PA_6 = 8 \), \( PA_7 = 9 \), and \( PA_8 = 11 \), the minimum is 8.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the specific heat capacities of the two materials, given their masses and the fact that they have the same heat capacity.

The specific heat capacity \( c \) of a material is given by the formula:
\[ c = \frac{Q}{m \Delta T} \]
where \( Q \) is the heat energy, \( m \) is the mass, and \( \Delta T \) is the change in temperature. Since the heat energy \( Q \) and the change in temperature \( \Delta T \) are the same for both materials, the specific heat capacities are inversely proportional to their masses. Therefore, we have:
\[ c_1 = \frac{Q}{m_1 \Delta T} \]
\[ c_2 = \frac{Q}{m_2 \Delta T} \]
\[ \frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{m_2}{m_1} \]

Given that the mass of the material σοφτμπολ \( m_1 \) is 200 g and the mass of the material μπέιζμπολ \( m_2 \) is 150 g, we can find the ratio of their specific heat capacities:
\[ \frac{c_1}{c_2} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Thus, the specific heat capacity of the material σοφτμπολ is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the specific heat capacity of the material μπέιζμπολ.

"To determine how many Greek letters are needed to represent the number \(629_{10}\) in bases 7 and 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to its equivalents in these bases.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7, we repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

In the base 7 representation \(1556_7\), the digits are 1, 5, 5, and 6. In the base 8 representation \(1165_8\), the digits are 1, 1, 6, and 5. The Greek letters are represented by the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. Therefore, the digits 1, 5, 6 in both representations correspond to Greek letters.

2. **Determine the number of muons that were not affected:**
   - 3 muons were not affected by the mass shooting.

"To find the coefficient of the highest degree term in the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Since \( g(x) \) is identical to \( f(x-1) \), we start by substituting \( x-1 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we need to expand each term in the expression. Starting with \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
Multiplying by 3, we get:
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

Next, we expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
Multiplying by 5, we get:
\[ 5(x-1)^2 = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

Next, we expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms with the constant term \(-2\):
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The coefficient of the highest degree term, which is \( x^4 \), is 3. Therefore, the coefficient of the highest degree term in \( g(x) \) is:

The slope of the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) is 2, so the slope of the perpendicular line is the negative reciprocal, which is \( -\frac{1}{2} \).

The equation of the perpendicular line passing through the point \( (6, 0) \) can be written as:
\[ y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6) \]
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \]

Next, we need to find the intersection of the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) and the line \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \). We set the equations equal to each other:

First, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots of the polynomial. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to express the given expressions in terms of these sums and products. Let's start with \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\). We can use the identity for the sum of products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[

\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the polynomial is symmetric and the roots can be paired in such a way that the expressions are equal. By symmetry and the fact that the polynomial is a quartic with no \(x^3\) term, we can deduce that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

Let \(S = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Then:
\[

\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
3S = 0 - 0 + 0 - 2 = -2.

Thus, \(S = -\frac{2}{3}\).

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\) is \(-\frac{2}{3}\), and the same value holds for \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

2. Ten mice and one golden mouse cost \$1.82:

We can eliminate \( g \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[
5m = 0.58

"To find the largest prime number that is a factor of the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\), we need to determine the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator and then identify the largest prime factor that is common to both.

First, let's factorize the numerator and the denominator:
- The numerator is 137. To check if 137 is a prime number, we test divisibility by all prime numbers less than \(\sqrt{137}\), which is approximately 11.7. The prime numbers to test are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11.
  - 137 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2.
  - The sum of the digits of 137 is \(1 + 3 + 7 = 11\), which is not divisible by 3, so 137 is not divisible by 3.
  - 137 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
  - To check divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \(137 \div 7 \approx 19.5714\), which is not an integer, so 137 is not divisible by 7.
  - To check divisibility by 11, we perform the division: \(137 \div 11 \approx 12.4545\), which is not an integer, so 137 is not divisible by 11.
  Since 137 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers, it is a prime number.
- The denominator is 500. We can factorize 500 as follows:
  \[

Now, we compare the prime factors of the numerator and the denominator:
- The prime factor of 137 is 137.
- The prime factors of 500 are 5 and 2.

The region inside the rectangle but outside the four circles is a square with side length \(2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) minus the area of the four quarter-circles at each vertex.

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

\[
r = a - bq = 54 - 54 = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\ 
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4. 
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) \):
1. First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
2. Since \( 1.05 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f \left( \sqrt{45} \right) \):
1. First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
2. Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f \left( \sqrt{45} \right) = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f \left( 8^{2/3} \right) \):
1. First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \).
2. Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f \left( 8^{2/3} \right) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) + f \left( \sqrt{45} \right) + f \left( 8^{2/3} \right) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents were spent in total on the tickets and how many tickets were bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the tickets in dollars.
2. Convert the total cost from dollars to cents.
3. Determine the number of tickets bought.

First, let's find the total cost of the tickets in dollars:
The cost of the η Λίντα is \$27.47.
The cost of the Σέρι is \$35.23.
The cost of the Τζουν is \$37.37.
The cost of the Κόνι is \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total cost of the tickets is \$126.59.

Next, we convert the total cost from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total cost by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659
\]

Therefore, the total amount spent in cents is \(\boxed{12659}\).

To determine the number of tickets bought, we note that each ticket costs \$1, so the number of tickets bought is the same as the number of tickets purchased. Since the problem does not specify the number of tickets bought, we can only conclude that the total cost in cents is \(\boxed{12659}\).","[12659, '12659']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the mean score (average score) of the test, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide that sum by the total number of students who took the test.

First, let's determine the total number of students who took the test:
- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

Adding these together, the total number of students is:
\[ 20 + 8 + 2 = 30 \]

Next, let's calculate the total sum of all the scores:
- The sum of the scores for the 20 students who scored 80 is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
- The sum of the scores for the 8 students who scored 90 is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
- The sum of the scores for the 2 students who scored 100 is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Adding these sums together, the total sum of all the scores is:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Now, we can find the mean score by dividing the total sum of the scores by the total number of students:
\[ \text{Mean score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the mean score (average score) of the test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column of the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid is the same. The grid is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3+3+n+1 = 2n+1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2+2n-9+1 = 3n-6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2+n+n-1 = 2n+1
\]

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the first and third rows is the same, which is \( 2n+1 \). For the sums of the rows to be equal, the sum of the numbers in the second row must also be \( 2n+1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
3n-6 = 2n+1
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n-6 = 1
\]

Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the grid and check the sums of the columns:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
7-3 & 3 & 7+1 \\
\hline
7+2 & 2(7)-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 7-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
=
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Since the sums of the numbers in all the rows and columns are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many more paces the Tzipma takes compared to the Midas, we need to calculate the number of paces each person takes and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the number of paces the Midas takes. The Midas takes a diagonal path from the center of the square to one of its corners. The length of the diagonal of a square with side length \( s \) is given by \( s\sqrt{2} \). Here, the side length \( s \) is 400 paces, so the diagonal is:
\[
400\sqrt{2} \text{ paces}
\]
The Midas takes a pace every 300 paces of the square's perimeter. The perimeter of the square is:
\[
4 \times 400 = 1600 \text{ paces}
\]
So, the number of paces the Midas takes is:
\[
\frac{400\sqrt{2}}{300} = \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} \approx \frac{4 \times 1.414}{3} \approx \frac{5.656}{3} \approx 1.8853
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of paces the Tzipma takes. The Tzipma takes a pace every 200 paces of the square's perimeter. So, the number of paces the Tzipma takes is:
\[
\frac{400\sqrt{2}}{200} = 2\sqrt{2} \approx 2 \times 1.414 \approx 2.828
\]

Now, we find the difference in the number of paces between the Tzipma and the Midas:
\[
2\sqrt{2} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{6\sqrt{2}}{3} - \frac{4\sqrt{2}}{3} = \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{3} \approx \frac{2 \times 1.414}{3} \approx \frac{2.828}{3} \approx 0.9427
\]

Therefore, the Tzipma takes approximately \(\boxed{0.94}\) more paces than the Midas.","[0.940000000000000, '0.94']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the point \( A \) on the line segment \( BC \) such that the distance from \( A \) to \( D \) is maximized, where \( D \) is a point that can be any point in the plane. The point \( A \) that maximizes the distance to \( D \) will be the point on \( BC \) that is farthest from \( D \).

Given that \( D \) can be any point in the plane, the point \( A \) that maximizes the distance to \( D \) will be the point on \( BC \) that is farthest from \( D \). This point will be the point on \( BC \) that is collinear with \( D \) and the line segment \( BC \).

To find this point, we need to consider the perpendicular from \( D \) to the line \( BC \). The point \( A \) will be the intersection of the line \( BC \) and the line passing through \( D \) and perpendicular to \( BC \).

However, since the problem does not provide specific coordinates for \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \), we cannot determine the exact coordinates of \( A \).
