"To determine if \( DE \) is the correct length given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( DF = 7 \), we need to use the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

In this problem, \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( DF \) is the hypotenuse. Let \( DE \) be the opposite side to angle \( D \). According to the definition of sine, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{DE}{DF}
\]
Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( DF = 7 \), we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{DE}{7}
\]
To find \( DE \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 7:
\[
DE = 0.7 \times 7 = 4.9
\]
Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{4.9}\).","[4.90000000000000, '4.9']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can use the formula for rotating a complex number \( z \) around another complex number \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), \( c = 2 - 3i \), and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). First, we need to compute \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \]

Next, we need to find \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We use the distributive property to expand this product:

\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})(-1)\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (3 - 3\sqrt{2})\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \right)i \]
\[ = 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + \left( 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2}i \right) \]
\[ = 2 + 4 - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + \left( -3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} \right)i \]

"To simplify the expression \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to find the prime factorization of 242 and then simplify the square root by taking out pairs of prime factors.

Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 242.
- Start by dividing 242 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
  \[
  242 \div 2 = 121
  \]
  So, 242 can be written as \(2 \times 121\).
- Next, factorize 121. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. Check the next prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. Check the next prime number, which is 7. Perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad \text{(not an integer)}
  \]
  So, 121 is not divisible by 7. Check the next prime number, which is 11. Perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 11 = 11
  \]
  So, 121 can be written as \(11 \times 11\).
- Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
  \[
  242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
  \]

Step 2: Simplify the square root by taking out pairs of prime factors.
- The square root of a product is the product of the square roots:
  \[
  \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

So, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas given the relationships between their ages. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( P \) be the age of Pierre.
   - Let \( R \) be the age of Rosa.
   - Let \( T \) be the age of Thomas.

2. **Set up the relationships:**
   - Pierre is 8 years older than Rosa: \( P = R + 8 \).
   - Pierre is 3 years younger than Thomas: \( P = T - 3 \).

3. **Express Rosa and Thomas in terms of Pierre:**
   - From \( P = R + 8 \), we can solve for \( R \): \( R = P - 8 \).
   - From \( P = T - 3 \), we can solve for \( T \): \( T = P + 3 \).

4. **Determine the ages:**
   - Since we don't have a specific value for Pierre's age, we can express the ages of Rosa and Thomas in terms of Pierre's age.
   - However, the problem asks for the ages of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in a specific order, which is given by the relationships. Therefore, we can assume Pierre is the oldest, followed by Thomas, and then Rosa.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Pierre is the oldest.
   - Thomas is the next oldest.
   - Rosa is the youngest.

Thus, the ages of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas in order from oldest to youngest are \( P \), \( T \), and \( R \) respectively. Since we don't have a specific value for \( P \), we can't determine the exact ages, but we can express them in terms of \( P \).

However, if we assume a specific value for \( P \) to find the exact ages, we can do the following:
- Let \( P = 11 \) (a reasonable age for Pierre).
- Then \( R = P - 8 = 11 - 8 = 3 \).
- And \( T = P + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 \).

So, the ages of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are 11, 3, and 14 respectively.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n+2)(n+4)(n+6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n+2)(n+4)(n+6) = (2+2)(2+4)(2+6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the pattern in the given sequence of pentagons and then apply that pattern to find the next pentagon in the sequence.

The sequence of pentagons is as follows:
1. A single pentagon.
2. Two pentagons sharing one side.
3. Three pentagons sharing sides.

We need to determine the next pentagon in the sequence, which would be four pentagons sharing sides. To do this, we need to count the number of sides that are shared and the number of sides that are not shared.

Let's analyze the pattern:
- The first pentagon has 5 sides.
- The second pentagon shares 1 side with the first pentagon, so it has 4 new sides.
- The third pentagon shares 2 sides with the first two pentagons, so it has 3 new sides.

Following this pattern, the fourth pentagon should share 3 sides with the first three pentagons, so it should have 2 new sides.

Therefore, the fourth pentagon will have a total of 5 sides (since it is a pentagon).

"To determine if the point \((x, y)\) on the line segment connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is such that \(x + y > 13\), we first need to find the equation of the line segment connecting these two points.

The slope \(m\) of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is:
\[
m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) and the point \((5, 3)\), we get:
\[
y - 3 = 5(x - 5)

Simplifying this, we have:
\[
y - 3 = 5x - 25 \implies y = 5x - 22
\]
The line segment connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) is therefore the line \(y = 5x - 22\) for \(5 \leq x \leq 6\).

We need to find the values of \(x\) and \(y\) on this line such that \(x > 7\). However, since the line segment is only defined for \(5 \leq x \leq 6\), there are no points on this line segment with \(x > 7\).

Therefore, the point \((x, y)\) on the line segment cannot have \(x + y > 13\).

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and any oblique asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same point. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can start by calculating \(99^2\) and then adding \(99\) and \(1\) to the result.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Therefore, the smallest value of \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:

2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[

\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[

\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the polynomial \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) multiplied by the polynomial \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product of the two polynomials and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare this expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:

1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

This equation is satisfied. Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

This equation is also satisfied. Therefore, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Finally, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the length of the tangent segment from the point of tangency to the point where the tangent line intersects the x-axis, given that the length of the tangent segment is \(20\pi\) units and the radius of the circle is 20 units.

Let's denote the point of tangency as \(T\) and the center of the circle as \(O\). The radius \(OT\) is perpendicular to the tangent line at the point of tangency \(T\). Let the point where the tangent line intersects the x-axis be \(P\).

We have a right triangle \(OTP\) where:
- \(OT\) is the radius of the circle, so \(OT = 20\) units.
- \(TP\) is the length of the tangent segment, so \(TP = 20\pi\) units.
- \(OP\) is the distance from the center of the circle to the point \(P\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(OTP\), we have:
\[
OP^2 = OT^2 + TP^2

Substituting the known values:
\[
OP^2 = 20^2 + (20\pi)^2

\[
OP^2 = 400 + 400\pi^2

\[
OP^2 = 400(1 + \pi^2)

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is equal to the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both are equal to \(f(a)\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} ax^2 = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

Next, we find the left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a. \]

We can rearrange this equation to:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\) from the equation, we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

We can further factor the quadratic expression:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

Since \(a\) is a positive number, we discard \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\). Therefore, the only solution is:
\[ a = 2. \]

To verify, we substitute \(a = 2\) back into the function:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2, \\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]

The right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches 2 is:
\[ \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8. \]

The left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches 2 is:
\[ \lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8. \]

And the value of the function at \(x = 2\) is:
\[ f(2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8. \]

Since all three values are equal, the function is continuous at \(x = 2\).

Thus, the value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) can be rewritten in the form \( (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1 \), we need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

First, let's complete the square for the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, let's complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the right side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

We want this equation to be in the form \( (x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we need the right side of the equation to be equal to 1:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that for any \(x \in [0,1]\), if \(f(x) \neq x\), then \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, let's find \(f(f(x))\). We start by computing \(f(x)\):

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

Next, we substitute \(f(x)\) into \(f\):

\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \(x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ 1 - \lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2. \]

So, we have:

\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0. \]

This equation holds for \(x = 0\) or for the expression inside the parentheses equal to zero:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0. \]

For \(x = 0\), the equation is satisfied. For \(x \neq 0\), we need:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

Let's expand the left-hand side:

\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1, \]
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + 2\lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), the polynomial must have no roots in \((0,1)\) other than the fixed points of \(f\). The fixed points of \(f\) are the solutions to \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x, \]
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]

So, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), the polynomial \(\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + 2\lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1\) must not have any roots in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By analyzing the polynomial, we find that it has no roots in \((0,1)\) other than the fixed points if and only if \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function is:

\[ f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2, \]
\[ f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x^2(2x^2 - 2x + 1) - 4x(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 8x^3 + 8x^2 - 4x = 8x^4 - 16x^3 + 12x^2 - 4x. \]

We need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). The polynomial \(8x^4 - 16x^3 + 12x^2 - 4x - x = 8x^4 - 16x^3 + 11x^2 - x = x(8x^3 - 16x^2 + 11x - 1)\) must have no roots in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). This is true because the polynomial \(8x^3 - 16x^2 + 11x - 1\) has no roots in \((0,1)\).

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The given equation is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Applying the same identities to the denominator, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

We can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) to rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression is a known trigonometric identity for the tangent of the sum of two angles. Specifically, it matches the form:

\[
\tan (A + B) = \frac{\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B}{\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B}.

In our case, \(A = 5^\circ\) and \(B = 20^\circ\), so:

"To determine if \(42!\) (42 factorial) is greater than 42, we need to understand what \(42!\) represents. The factorial of a number \(n\), denoted as \(n!\), is the product of all positive integers from 1 to \(n\). Therefore, \(42!\) is the product of all integers from 1 to 42.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will analyze the function and its behavior at the boundary points and critical points.

First, let's consider the boundary points. The boundary points of the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) are \( (1, 1) \), \( (1, -1) \), \( (-1, 1) \), and \( (-1, -1) \).

1. Evaluate \( f(1, 1) \):
   \[
   f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

2. Evaluate \( f(1, -1) \):
   \[
   f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

3. Evaluate \( f(-1, 1) \):
   \[
   f(-1, 1) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = (-1) \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

4. Evaluate \( f(-1, -1) \):
   \[
   f(-1, -1) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = (-1) \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

Next, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the region. To do this, we find the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]

The partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = y^2 x^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the second equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

Both equations give us the same condition \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). This means that the critical points lie on the boundary of the region. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) must occur at one of the boundary points, which we have already evaluated and found to be 0.

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, since \( z \cdot \frac{1}{z} = 1 \). The number \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, which is greater than 1. Therefore, \( z \) must be a complex number on the unit circle that is not real.

We can express \( z \) in exponential form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \), where \( \theta \) is the argument of \( z \). The given equation then becomes:
\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:
\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]
Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:
\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]
The corresponding value of \( \sin\theta \) is:
\[ \sin\theta = \pm \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta} = \pm \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2} = \pm \sqrt{1 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \pm \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]
Since \( z \) is on the unit circle and \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) is positive, \( \theta \) must be in the first or fourth quadrant. Therefore, \( \sin\theta \) is positive:
\[ \sin\theta = \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]
Thus, \( z = e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} + i\frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the property of exponents, \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \), we have:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]
To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) is a multiple of \( \frac{2\pi}{5} \) because \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \), which is related to the fifth roots of unity. Specifically, \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = -\frac{2\pi}{5} \).

If \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \), then:
\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi. \]
Since \( \cos(34\pi) = \cos(0) = 1 \), we have:
\[ \cos(85\theta) = 1. \]
Therefore:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

If \( \theta = -\frac{2\pi}{5} \), then:
\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot -\frac{2\pi}{5} = -34\pi. \]
Since \( \cos(-34\pi) = \cos(0) = 1 \), we have:
\[ \cos(85\theta) = 1. \]
Therefore:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

In both cases, the value is the same. Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{2}. \]","[2, '2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of triangle \(ABC\) given that the area of triangle \(GBC\) is 144, and the points \(M\) and \(N\) are such that \(BM = MN = NC\).

First, let's recall that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), where \(D\) is the midpoint of \(BC\).

Since \(BM = MN = NC\), \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(BC\) into three equal segments. This means that \(BM = MN = NC = \frac{BC}{3}\).

The area of triangle \(GBC\) is one-third of the area of triangle \(ABC\) because the centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is three times the area of triangle \(GBC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(GBC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
3 \times 144 = 432

Thus, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\boxed{432}\).","[432, '432']",8,"[8, '8']",False
"To determine how many more vya hesabu the vitabu will have compared to the vitabu vya hesabu, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of vya hesabu the vitabu has after each step.
2. Compare the final number of vya hesabu to the number of vya hesabu vya hesabu.

Let's start with the initial number of vya hesabu:
- Initial number of vya hesabu: 24

Next, we add the vya hesabu vya hesabu step by step:
- After the first step: \(24 + 8 = 32\)
- After the second step: \(32 + 10 = 42\)
- After the third step: \(42 + 6 = 48\)

So, the final number of vya hesabu the vitabu has is 48.

Now, we compare this to the number of vya hesabu vya hesabu, which is 8.

The difference between the final number of vya hesabu and the number of vya hesabu vya hesabu is:
\[48 - 8 = 40\]

Therefore, the vitabu will have \(\boxed{40}\) more vya hesabu than the vitabu vya hesabu.","[40, '40']",\frac{4}{9},"[4/9, '\\frac{4}{9}']",False

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected number from 100 to 150 is a multiple of 5, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the range of numbers:**
   The numbers range from 100 to 150.

2. **Count the total number of integers in this range:**
   The total number of integers from 100 to 150 is calculated as:
   \[
   150 - 100 + 1 = 51
   \]

3. **Identify the multiples of 5 within this range:**
   A number is a multiple of 5 if it can be expressed in the form \(5k\) where \(k\) is an integer. We need to find the smallest and largest integers \(k\) such that \(100 \leq 5k \leq 150\).

   - The smallest \(k\) is:
     \[
     \left\lceil \frac{100}{5} \right\rceil = 20

**Case 1: The committee has 3 members from the first category and 1 member from the second category.**

The number of ways to choose 3 members from the first category is \( \binom{3}{3} \), and the number of ways to choose 1 member from the second category is \( \binom{2}{1} \). Therefore, the total number of ways for this case is:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \frac{3}{4} \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

Therefore, the original expression is:

\[ z = c \]

This equation represents a plane in three-dimensional space where the \( z \)-coordinate is constant and equal to \( c \). In cylindrical coordinates, the variables are \( r \), \( \theta \), and \( z \). The equation \( z = c \) does not depend on \( r \) or \( \theta \), meaning that for any values of \( r \) and \( \theta \), the value of \( z \) remains \( c \).

In cylindrical coordinates, a plane where \( z \) is constant is represented as a flat surface parallel to the \( r\theta \)-plane at a height \( c \) along the \( z \)-axis. This surface is often referred to as a horizontal plane.

"To find the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the properties of the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[

"To find the mizzi \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we first need to expand \( g(x) \). We start by substituting \( x+5 \) into \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term separately. First, expand \( (x+5)^3 \):

\[
(x+5)^3 = x^3 + 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 5^2 + 5^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]

Next, expand \( -49(x+5)^2 \):

\[
-49(x+5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot 5 + 5^2) = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225
\]

Next, expand \( 623(x+5) \):

\[
623(x+5) = 623x + 623 \cdot 5 = 623x + 3115
\]

Now, substitute these expanded forms back into the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15 - 49)x^2 + (75 - 490 + 623)x + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015)

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 1008x + 0
\]
\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 1008x
\]

The mizzi of \( g(x) \) is the value of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). Therefore, we need to solve the equation:

\[
x^3 - 34x^2 + 1008x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( x \):

\[
x(x^2 - 34x + 1008) = 0
\]

This gives us one solution immediately:

\[
x = 0
\]

Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 34x + 1008 = 0 \). We use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -34 \), and \( c = 1008 \):

\[
x = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{(-34)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1008}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
x = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{1156 - 4032}}{2}

\[
x = \frac{34 \pm \sqrt{-2876}}{2}

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). Using this, we can rewrite \(\sin 20^\circ\) as \(\cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) as \(\cos 50^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to rewrite \(\cos^2 70^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cos^2 50^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 40^\circ\). So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) and \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

We can factor out the 2:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 80^\circ} \right).
\]

To simplify the expression inside the parentheses, we use the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\). Thus, \(1 + \cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ\) and \(1 - \cos 40^\circ = 2 \sin^2 20^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)\) and \(1 - \cos 80^\circ = 2 \sin^2 40^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{2 \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 40^\circ} \right).
\]

We can further simplify this by using the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\) again:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 \sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 \sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific sum of reciprocals of squares of cosines and sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\) is 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon. We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division on the right side:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

So, we have:

\[
n-2 \approx 5.9444
\]

To isolate \(n\), we add 2 to both sides:

\[
n \approx 7.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be a whole number (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), we round 7.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 8. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the sum of the interior angles of an octagon using the formula:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ

This is because if \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) were rational, then we could write it as a fraction \(\frac{p}{q}\) where \(p\) and \(q\) are integers and \(q \neq 0\). This would imply that \(\sqrt{3} = \frac{p}{q} - 5\), which is the difference between a rational number and an integer, and thus a rational number. However, we know that \(\sqrt{3}\) is irrational, so the assumption that \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is rational must be false.

Therefore, the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is irrational.

"To determine if the number 2003 is in the sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, \(\dots\), we need to recognize that this sequence is an arithmetic sequence of odd numbers where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

For our sequence, the \(n\)-th term \(a_n\) is:
\[ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1 \]

We need to find if there exists a positive integer \(n\) such that \(a_n = 2003\). This means we need to solve the equation:
\[ 2n - 1 = 2003 \]

Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:
\[ 2n = 2004 \]

Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[ n = 1002 \]

Since \(n = 1002\) is a positive integer, the number 2003 is indeed the 1002nd term of the sequence. Therefore, the answer is:

"To find \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Compute \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Compute \( g \) of the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to first understand the relationship between the inverse trigonometric functions \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\).

Recall that for any positive real number \(x\),
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x).
\]
This is because the cotangent of an angle is the reciprocal of the tangent of that angle. Therefore, if \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}\), and thus \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Substituting this into the original equation, we get
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3},
\]
which simplifies to
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Next, we use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta).
\]
Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
Thus, the equation becomes
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\). Substituting these values in, we get
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

Since \(x\) must be positive, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, the solution is
\[

"To determine if the two lines are parallel, we need to check if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This means that the direction vector of the second line is indeed a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line, specifically, it is 2 times the direction vector of the first line.

Since the direction vectors are parallel, the lines are either parallel or the same line. To check if they are the same line, we need to see if there is a point that lies on both lines. Let's find a point on each line and see if they are the same.

For the first line, when \(t = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\).

For the second line, when \(u = 0\), the point is \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

Clearly, the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) are not the same. Therefore, the lines are parallel but not the same line.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the equation of the circle that passes through the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\). These points form a rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. The center of the circle that passes through these points is the midpoint of the diagonals of the rectangle.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5 + (-5)}{2}, \frac{4 + (-4)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{0}{2}, \frac{0}{2} \right) = (0,0).
\]

Next, let's verify that this midpoint is also the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting \((-5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{-5 + 5}{2}, \frac{4 + (-4)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{0}{2}, \frac{0}{2} \right) = (0,0).
\]

Since the midpoint of both diagonals is \((0,0)\), the center of the circle is \((0,0)\).

Now, we need to find the radius of the circle. The radius is the distance from the center \((0,0)\) to any of the points on the circle. Let's use the point \((5,4)\):
\[

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(CD\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\).

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [ACD] + [BCD]
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
[ACD] + [BCD] = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding bases:
\[
\frac{[ACD]}{[BCD]} = \left(\frac{AD}{BC}\right)^2
\]

However, we can also express the areas of the triangles in terms of the height \(h\) and the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\):
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot h
\]
\[
[BCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height \(h\) is the same for both triangles. The ratio of the areas of the triangles is equal to the ratio of their bases:
\[
\frac{[ACD]}{[BCD]} = \frac{AD}{BC}
\]

Let \(k = \frac{AD}{BC}\). Then:
\[
[ACD] = k \cdot [BCD]
\]

Substituting this into the area equation for quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we get:
\[
k \cdot [BCD] + [BCD] = 42
\]
\[
(k + 1) \cdot [BCD] = 42
\]
\[
[BCD] = \frac{42}{k + 1}
\]

Since \([ACD] = k \cdot [BCD]\), we have:
\[
[ACD] = k \cdot \frac{42}{k + 1} = \frac{42k}{k + 1}

To find the value of \(k\), we use the fact that the triangles are similar and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding bases. However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the areas of the triangles is 42. Since the triangles are similar and the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding bases, we can use the fact that the sum of the areas of the triangles is 42.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in the given configuration of two circles with radii 1 and 2, and a common external tangent that touches the circles at points \(A\) and \(B\) respectively. The length of the common external tangent \(AB\) is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the length of the common internal tangent.

First, let's find the length of the common internal tangent. The formula for the length of the common internal tangent between two circles with radii \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) and distance between their centers \(d\) is:
\[
\sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 + r_2)^2}
\]
For our circles, \(r_1 = 1\), \(r_2 = 2\), and the distance between the centers \(d\) is the sum of the radii plus the length of the common internal tangent. However, we can use the fact that the length of the common external tangent \(AB\) is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the length of the common internal tangent. Let's denote the length of the common internal tangent by \(L\). Then:
\[
AB = \frac{5}{12}L
\]
The formula for the length of the common external tangent is:
\[
AB = \sqrt{d^2 - (r_1 - r_2)^2}
\]
Since the circles are externally tangent, the distance between their centers \(d\) is \(1 + 2 = 3\). Therefore:
\[
AB = \sqrt{3^2 - (1 - 2)^2} = \sqrt{9 - 1} = \sqrt{8} = 2\sqrt{2}

where \( r \) is the radius of the cylinder and \( h \) is the height of the water. Since the radius \( r \) is constant, the volume \( V \) is directly proportional to the height \( h \). This means that if the height \( h \) changes, the volume \( V \) will change by the same factor.

From the problem, we know that when the height \( h \) is 8 cm, the volume \( V \) is 8 cm³. We need to find the volume \( V \) when the height \( h \) is 6 cm.

First, we can find the constant of proportionality \( k \) between the volume and the height. Since \( V = k \cdot h \), we can substitute the known values to find \( k \):

\[ 8 = k \cdot 8 \]

Solving for \( k \), we get:

\[ k = 1 \]

So, the relationship between the volume and the height is:

\[ V = h \]

Now, we can find the volume when the height is 6 cm:

\[ V = 6 \]

Therefore, the volume of water in the tank when the height is 6 cm is \(\boxed{6}\) cm³.","[6, '6']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Therefore, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We use the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \) where \( a = \sqrt{21} \) and \( b = 2 \sqrt{3} \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9

Therefore, the product is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to select 5 candidates from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats such that at least one candidate is a Democrat.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to select 5 candidates from the 14 candidates (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to select 5 candidates such that all of them are Republicans. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

The number of ways to select 5 candidates such that at least one candidate is a Democrat is the total number of ways to select 5 candidates minus the number of ways to select 5 candidates that are all Republicans:

\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} = 2002 - 56 = 1946

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0

   Simplifying the left side, we get:

   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[

\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), and that \( AD = 10 \) with \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to find the lengths of the sides of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = 180^\circ - 2\theta \) and \( \angle CMA = 2\theta \).

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{CD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}
\]
This implies \( BD = CD \), so \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Therefore, \( \triangle BDC \) is isosceles with \( BD = CD \).

Now, using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[
\frac{AB}{\sin \angle AMB} = \frac{AM}{\sin \angle ABM} = \frac{AM}{\sin \angle ACB}
\]
Since \( \angle AMB = 180^\circ - 2\theta \) and \( \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{\sin (180^\circ - 2\theta)} = \frac{11}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{11}{\cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}
\]
Thus,
\[
AB = \frac{11 \sin 2\theta}{\cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{11 \cdot 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{\cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)} = 22 \sin \theta \cos \theta \sec \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 22 \sin \theta \cos \theta \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{1 + \cos \theta}} = \frac{44 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{\sqrt{1 + \cos \theta}}
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[
AC = \frac{44 \sin \theta \cos \theta}{\sqrt{1 + \cos \theta}}
\]
Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \theta
\]
Since \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BC = 2BD \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{2 \cdot 10}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{20}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{20}{\cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)}
\]
Thus,
\[
BC = \frac{20 \sin 3\theta}{\cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{20 \cdot 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta}{\cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{60 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta}{\cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)}
\]
Since \( \cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = 4 \cos^3 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) - 3 \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 4 \left( \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2} \right)^3 - 3 \left( \frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2} \right) = \frac{1 + 3 \cos \theta + 3 \cos^2 \theta + \cos^3 \theta}{2} - \frac{3 + 3 \cos \theta}{2} = \frac{3 \cos^2 \theta + \cos^3 \theta - 2}{2} \), we have:
\[
BC = \frac{60 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta}{\frac{3 \cos^2 \theta + \cos^3 \theta - 2}{2}} = \frac{120 \sin \theta - 8 \sin^3 \theta}{3 \cos^2 \theta + \cos^3 \theta - 2}
\]
By solving the equations, we find that \( \theta = 30^\circ \). Therefore, \( \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \). Substituting these values, we get:
\[
AB = AC = \frac{44 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{2}}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{3} \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}} = \frac{11 \sqrt{6}}{\sqrt{2 + \sqrt{3}}} = 11 \sqrt{2}

\[
BC = \frac{120 \cdot \frac{1}{2} - 8 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3}{3 \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right)^3 - 2} = \frac{60 - 1}{\frac{9}{4} + \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{8} - 2} = \frac{59}{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{3 \sqrt{3}}{8}} = \frac{59}{\frac{2 + 3 \sqrt{3}}{8}} = \frac{472}{2 + 3 \sqrt{3}} = 44

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\]

Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as a perfect square:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\]

The expression \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number, which is always non-negative. The only time it is equal to zero is when \(x^2 + 2 = 0\), but this equation has no real solutions because \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always positive for all real \(x\).

So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\]

Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\]

Next, we find the roots of the equation \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = 0\):
\[x^2 + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 - 3 = 0\]
\[x^2 = -7 \quad \text{(no real solutions)} \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 3\]
\[x = \pm \sqrt{3}\]

These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -\sqrt{3})\), \((- \sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\), and \((\sqrt{3}, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(x \in (-\infty, -\sqrt{3})\), choose \(x = -2\):
  \[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = 11 \cdot 1 = 11 > 0\]
  So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.

- For \(x \in (-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})\), choose \(x = 0\):
  \[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = 7 \cdot (-3) = -21 < 0\]
  So, the inequality holds in this interval.

- For \(x \in (\sqrt{3}, \infty)\), choose \(x = 2\):
  \[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = 11 \cdot 1 = 11 > 0\]
  So, the inequality does not hold in this interval.

Therefore, the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) holds for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\). From Step 2, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is true for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\). Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).

We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right),
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we solve for \(s\):
\[
s = \frac{24}{p}.
\]

Substituting \(s = \frac{24}{p}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\frac{576}{p^2} - 3p\right),
\]
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 3p^3}{p^2},
\]
\[

"To determine the percentage increase in the value of the wasichana compared to the wavulana from the 9th to the 12th daraja, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the percentage values of the wavulana and wasichana for the 9th and 12th daraja.
2. Calculate the difference in the percentage values of the wasichana and wavulana for the 12th daraja.
3. Calculate the percentage increase based on the wavulana value.

From the table, we have:
- For the 9th daraja:
  - Wavulana: \(41.1\%\)
  - Wasichana: \(39.4\%\)
- For the 12th daraja:
  - Wavulana: \(11.6\%\)
  - Wasichana: \(8.6\%\)

Next, we calculate the difference in the percentage values of the wasichana and wavulana for the 12th daraja:
\[ \text{Difference} = 8.6\% - 11.6\% = -3\% \]

Since the difference is negative, it indicates that the wasichana value is less than the wavulana value. However, the problem asks for the percentage increase in the value of the wasichana compared to the wavulana, which implies we need to consider the absolute value of the difference in terms of the wavulana value.

The percentage increase is calculated as:
\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Difference}}{\text{Wavulana Value}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{-3\%}{11.6\%} \right) \times 100 \approx -25.81\% \]

However, the problem states that the wasichana value is \(135\%\) of the wavulana value, which means the wasichana value is actually \(135\% - 100\% = 35\%\) more than the wavulana value. Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that the wasichana value is \(135\%\) of the wavulana value, which is a \(35\%\) increase.

Thus, the correct answer is:

\boxed{35\%}

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(|x^2 - 81|\) is the absolute value of \(x^2 - 81\), which is always non-negative. The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x - 36)\), which changes sign at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

The inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) will be satisfied when the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, or when the numerator is negative and the denominator is positive. However, since the numerator is an absolute value, it is always non-negative, and it is zero only at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality can only be satisfied when the denominator is negative.

The denominator \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\) is negative when \(0 < x < 36\). So, we need to check if the numerator is non-zero in this interval. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is non-zero for \(x \neq 9\) and \(x \neq -9\). Since \(x\) is in the interval \(0 < x < 36\), it does not include \(x = -9\), so the numerator is non-zero for \(0 < x < 36\) and \(x \neq 9\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[
0 < x < 36 \quad \text{and} \quad x \neq 9.
\]
In interval notation, this is:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in the given diagram. The diagram consists of a semicircle with a radius of 2 units and a right triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 2 units.

First, let's calculate the area of the semicircle. The formula for the area of a circle is:
\[
A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
\]
Since we have a semicircle, we take half of the area of the full circle:
\[
A_{\text{semicircle}} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (2)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \cdot 4 = 2\pi
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the right triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle is:
\[
A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 = 3
\]

The shaded region is the area of the semicircle minus the area of the triangle:
\[
A_{\text{shaded}} = A_{\text{semicircle}} - A_{\text{triangle}} = 2\pi - 3
\]

We are given that the area of the shaded region is 400. Therefore, we have:
\[
2\pi - 3 = 400
\]

To find the value of \(\pi\), we solve the equation:
\[
2\pi = 403
\]
\[
\pi = \frac{403}{2}
\]

However, this value of \(\pi\) is not the standard value of \(\pi\). The problem is asking for the value of \(\pi\) that fits the given conditions, and the correct interpretation is that the area of the semicircle is 400 plus the area of the triangle. Therefore, the correct value of \(\pi\) is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that the hypotenuse \(RT = 5\), we can find the length of the opposite side \(RS\) as follows:

\[
RS = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

\[

Now, we can find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, the opposite side to \(\angle T\) is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\), so:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

"To find the value of \(a + b\) where the point \((a, b)\) lies on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we need to substitute \(x = a\) and \(y = b\) into the equation of the curve and solve for \(a\) and \(b\).

Starting with the equation of the curve:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \]

"To determine if the point \((6, 0)\) lies on the line given by the equation \(y = 2x - 2\), we need to substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation and check if the equation holds true.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify the coordinates of the point. The point is \((6, 0)\), so \(x = 6\) and \(y = 0\).
2. Substitute \(x = 6\) into the equation \(y = 2x - 2\).
3. Calculate the right-hand side of the equation.
4. Compare the calculated value with the value of \(y\) from the point.

2. Calculate the right-hand side:

"Given the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which tell us the following relationships for the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\):
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]
For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]

To find the individual values, we can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as:
\[
(x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2.
\]
By comparing coefficients, we obtain:
\[
a + c = 2,
\]
\[
ac + b + d = 0,
\]
\[
ad + bc = 0,
\]
\[
bd = 2.
\]

We can solve these equations step by step. From \(bd = 2\), we can express \(d\) as \(d = \frac{2}{b}\). Substituting \(d = \frac{2}{b}\) into the other equations, we get:
\[
ac + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0,
\]
\[
a \left(\frac{2}{b}\right) + bc = 0 \implies \frac{2a}{b} + bc = 0 \implies 2a + b^2c = 0 \implies c = -\frac{2a}{b^2}.
\]
Substituting \(c = -\frac{2a}{b^2}\) into \(a + c = 2\), we get:
\[
a - \frac{2a}{b^2} = 2 \implies a \left(1 - \frac{2}{b^2}\right) = 2 \implies a = \frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}.
\]
Substituting \(a = \frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\) and \(c = -\frac{2a}{b^2} = -\frac{2 \left(\frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\right)}{b^2} = -\frac{4}{b^2 - 2}\) into \(ac + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0\), we get:
\[
\left(\frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\right) \left(-\frac{4}{b^2 - 2}\right) + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0 \implies -\frac{8b^2}{(b^2 - 2)^2} + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0.
\]
Multiplying through by \(b(b^2 - 2)^2\), we get:
\[
-8b^3 + b^2(b^2 - 2)^2 + 2(b^2 - 2)^2 = 0.
\]
This is a complex equation, so we can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and can be written in terms of trigonometric functions. The roots are:
\[
\alpha_1 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{\pi}{8}, \quad \alpha_2 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{3\pi}{8}, \quad \alpha_3 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{5\pi}{8}, \quad \alpha_4 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8}.
\]
Using these roots, we can find:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{\pi}{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{3\pi}{8} + \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8} = 2 \left(\cos \frac{\pi}{8} \cos \frac{3\pi}{8} + \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8}\right) = 2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{\pi}{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} + \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{3\pi}{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8} = 2 \left(\cos \frac{\pi}{8} \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} + \cos \frac{3\pi}{8} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8}\right) = 2 \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{\pi}{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8} + \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{3\pi}{8} \cdot \sqrt{2} \cos \frac{5\pi}{8} = 2 \left(\cos \frac{\pi}{8} \cos \frac{7\pi}{8} + \cos \frac{3\pi}{8} \cos \frac{5\pi}{8}\right) = 2 \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}\right) = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

2. Since 500 is greater than 137, the integer part of the quotient is 0.
3. To continue the division, we add a decimal point and zeros to 137, making it 137.000000.
4. Now, we divide 1370 by 500, which gives 2 with a remainder of 370.
5. Bring down the next 0, making it 3700. Divide 3700 by 500, which gives 7 with a remainder of 200.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the point \( P \) on the diagonal \( AC \) of the rectangle \( ABCD \) such that the ratio \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \) and the distance from \( P \) to the center \( O \) is minimized.

First, let's place the rectangle \( ABCD \) in the coordinate plane with \( A = (-a, -b) \), \( B = (a, -b) \), \( C = (a, b) \), and \( D = (-a, b) \). The center \( O \) of the rectangle is at the midpoint of the diagonals, which is \( O = (0, 0) \).

The equation of the diagonal \( AC \) can be found using the points \( A \) and \( C \). The slope of \( AC \) is \( \frac{b - (-b)}{a - (-a)} = \frac{2b}{2a} = \frac{b}{a} \). Therefore, the equation of the line \( AC \) is:
\[ y = \frac{b}{a}x. \]

Let \( P \) be a point on \( AC \) with coordinates \( (x, y) \). Since \( P \) lies on \( AC \), we have \( y = \frac{b}{a}x \).

The distance from \( P \) to the center \( O \) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{b}{a}x\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}x^2} = \sqrt{\left(1 + \frac{b^2}{a^2}\right)x^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a^2}}x = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}x. \]

To minimize the distance \( d \), we need to minimize \( x \). Since \( P \) lies on \( AC \) and \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( \frac{2b}{2a} = k \), which simplifies to \( \frac{b}{a} = k \). Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (x, kx) \).

The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is:
\[ d = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{a}x = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + (ka)^2}}{a}x = \frac{\sqrt{a^2(1 + k^2)}}{a}x = \sqrt{1 + k^2}x. \]

To minimize \( d \), we need to minimize \( x \). Since \( P \) lies on \( AC \), the minimum value of \( x \) is 0, but this corresponds to the point \( O \), which is not on \( AC \). Instead, we need to find the point \( P \) on \( AC \) such that the distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is minimized. This point is the foot of the perpendicular from \( O \) to \( AC \).

The equation of the line perpendicular to \( AC \) passing through \( O \) is:
\[ y = -\frac{a}{b}x. \]

To find the intersection of this line with \( AC \), we solve the system of equations:
\[ y = \frac{b}{a}x, \]
\[ y = -\frac{a}{b}x. \]

Setting the equations equal to each other, we get:
\[ \frac{b}{a}x = -\frac{a}{b}x. \]

Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ \frac{b^2}{a}x = -\frac{a^2}{b}x, \]
\[ \frac{b^3}{a}x = -\frac{a^3}{b}x, \]
\[ \frac{b^4}{a^4}x = -x, \]
\[ x\left(\frac{b^4}{a^4} + 1\right) = 0. \]

Since \( x \neq 0 \), we have:
\[ \frac{b^4}{a^4} = -1, \]
which is not possible. Therefore, the correct approach is to use the fact that the point \( P \) is the intersection of the line \( AC \) and the line \( y = -\frac{a}{b}x \).

The correct coordinates of \( P \) are:
\[ P = \left( \frac{a^3}{a^2 + b^2}, \frac{b^3}{a^2 + b^2} \right). \]

The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is:
\[ d = \sqrt{\left( \frac{a^3}{a^2 + b^2} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{b^3}{a^2 + b^2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{a^6 + b^6}{(a^2 + b^2)^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{a^6 + b^6}}{a^2 + b^2}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given values and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases}

\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4. 
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given values step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( 1.05 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

- For the second group: 20 Lilifanya with 80 walipata each. The total number of walipata is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).

Additionally, we are given that the sum of the numbers in the first column is 2, the sum of the numbers in the second column is \( n \), and the sum of the numbers in the third column is \( n-1 \).

These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

First, let's find the area of \( \triangle ABD \). The sides of \( \triangle ABD \) are \( AB = 6 \), \( AD = 5 \), and \( BD = 3 \). We can use Heron's formula to find the area of \( \triangle ABD \).

The semi-perimeter \( s \) of \( \triangle ABD \) is:
\[
s = \frac{AB + AD + BD}{2} = \frac{6 + 5 + 3}{2} = 7
\]

Using Heron's formula, the area \( K \) of \( \triangle ABD \) is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{7(7-6)(7-5)(7-3)} = \sqrt{7 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 4} = \sqrt{56} = 2\sqrt{14}
\]

Next, let's find the area of \( \triangle BCD \). The sides of \( \triangle BCD \) are \( BC = 6 \), \( BD = 3 \), and \( CD = 4 \). Again, we can use Heron's formula to find the area of \( \triangle BCD \).

The semi-perimeter \( s \) of \( \triangle BCD \) is:
\[
s = \frac{BC + BD + CD}{2} = \frac{6 + 3 + 4}{2} = 6.5
\]

Using Heron's formula, the area \( K \) of \( \triangle BCD \) is:
\[
K = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} = \sqrt{6.5(6.5-6)(6.5-3)(6.5-4)} = \sqrt{6.5 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 3.5 \cdot 2.5} = \sqrt{28.4375} = \frac{\sqrt{455}}{4}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of a triangle can be found using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). We can find the height from \( C \) to \( BD \) by using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, half of \( BD \), and the side \( CD \).

Let the height be \( h \). Then:
\[
h^2 + 1.5^2 = 4^2 \implies h^2 + 2.25 = 16 \implies h^2 = 13.75 \implies h = \sqrt{13.75} = \frac{\sqrt{55}}{2}
\]

The area of \( \triangle BCD \) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times \frac{\sqrt{55}}{2} = \frac{3\sqrt{55}}{4}
\]

Finally, the total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \):
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = 2\sqrt{14} + \frac{3\sqrt{55}}{4}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of a quadrilateral can be found using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + c) \), where \( d \) is the distance between the diagonals, \( a \) is one diagonal, and \( c \) is the other diagonal. In this case, the diagonals are \( AC \) and \( BD \), and the distance between them is the height from \( D \) to \( AC \).

The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 5 = 15
\]

The area of \( \triangle BCD \) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 4 = 12
\]

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = 15 + 12 = 27
\]

Thus, the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\boxed{27}
