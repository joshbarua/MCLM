"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) where \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given information:**
   - \(\sin D = 0.7\)
   - \(EF = 7\)
   - \(E\) is the right angle, so \(DE\) is the opposite side to \(\angle D\) and \(DF\) is the hypotenuse.

2. **Recall the definition of sine:**
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{DE}{DF}
   \]
   Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can write:
   \[
   \frac{DE}{DF} = 0.7
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   DE = 0.7 \cdot DF
   \]

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem:**
   In the right triangle \(DEF\), the Pythagorean theorem states:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
   \]
   We know \(EF = 7\), so:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 = DE^2 + 49
   \]

4. **Substitute \(DE\) in terms of \(DF\) into the Pythagorean theorem:**
   From \(DE = 0.7 \cdot DF\), we substitute \(DE\) in the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   DF^2 = (0.7 \cdot DF)^2 + 49
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   DF^2 = 0.49 \cdot DF^2 + 49
   \]

5. **Isolate \(DF^2\):**
   Subtract \(0.49 \cdot DF^2\) from both sides:
   \[
   DF^2 - 0.49 \cdot DF^2 = 49
   \]
   Factor out \(DF^2\) on the left-hand side:
   \[
   0.51 \cdot DF^2 = 49
   \]
   Solve for \(DF^2\):
   \[
   DF^2 = \frac{49}{0.51} = \frac{4900}{51}
   \]
   Take the square root of both sides to find \(DF\):
   \[
   DF = \sqrt{\frac{4900}{51}} = \frac{70}{\sqrt{51}} = \frac{70 \sqrt{51}}{51}
   \]

6. **Find \(DE\):**
   Substitute \(DF\) back into the expression for \(DE\):
   \[
   DE = 0.7 \cdot DF = 0.7 \cdot \frac{70 \sqrt{51}}{51} = \frac{49 \sqrt{51}}{51}
   \]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\frac{49 \sqrt{51}}{51}}\).","[(49*sqrt(51))/51, '\\frac{49 \\sqrt{51}}{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is the result of rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in terms of their real and imaginary parts:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} + 3)i = \sqrt{2} - (6 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - (6 + 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Expanding this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (6 + 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (6 + 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - (6 + 3\sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (6 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} i^2
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \):
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - (6 + 3\sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (6 + 3\sqrt{2}) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - (6\sqrt{2} + 6)i \frac{1}{2} + (6\sqrt{2} + 6) \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - (3\sqrt{2} + 3)i + (3\sqrt{2} + 3)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (1 + 3\sqrt{2} + 3) + (1 - 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i

   \[
   z'' = (4 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (2 + 3\sqrt{2})i

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (2 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 2 - 3i = (6 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (5 + 3\sqrt{2})i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

6. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the number of ways to divide 8 friends into two groups such that 3 specific friends (Pier, Riza, and Tom) are in the same group, we can follow these steps:

1. **Fix the group containing the 3 specific friends:**
   - Since Pier, Riza, and Tom must be in the same group, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to dividing the remaining 5 friends into two groups.

2. **Determine the number of ways to divide the remaining 5 friends into two groups:**
   - Each of the remaining 5 friends has 2 choices: they can either be in the same group as the block of Pier, Riza, and Tom or in the other group. Therefore, there are \(2^5 = 32\) ways to assign the remaining 5 friends to the two groups.

3. **Account for the fact that the order of the groups does not matter:**
   - Since the two groups are indistinguishable, each division of the 5 friends into two groups is counted twice (once for each group). Therefore, we need to divide the total number of divisions by 2.

4. **Calculate the final number of ways:**
   - The total number of ways to divide the 8 friends into two groups such that Pier, Riza, and Tom are in the same group is \(\frac{32}{2} = 16\).

Thus, the number of ways to divide 8 friends into two groups such that 3 specific friends are in the same group is \(\boxed{16}\).","[16, '16']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3.
\]
So,
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To determine the minimum number of degrees of rotation required to align a regular pentagon with its center, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \) and still look the same.

The problem states that a regular pentagon is rotated around its center by an angle that is a multiple of \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \). To align the pentagon with its original position, the rotation angle must be a multiple of \( 72^\circ \) that results in the pentagon looking exactly the same as it did before.

The smallest positive angle that satisfies this condition is \( 72^\circ \). Therefore, the minimum number of degrees of rotation required to align the pentagon with its center is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and then calculate \(x + y\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct fourth vertex should be \((x, y)\) such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. The correct calculation should be re-evaluated with the correct x-coordinate greater than 7. The correct x-coordinate should be 8, and the correct y-coordinate should be 5.

So, the correct fourth vertex is \((8, 5)\).

Now, we can calculate \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 5 = 13

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To find \(\tan A\) given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) in a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

2. Substitute the given relationship \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) into the tangent definition:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will cause the function to approach infinity or negative infinity.

First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). If the degrees are equal, the horizontal asymptote is the ratio of the leading coefficients. If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In this case, the numerator \( 2x \) is a polynomial of degree 1, and the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is a polynomial of degree 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Finally, we calculate \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):

So, \(99^2 = 9801\).

Next, we add \(99\) to \(9801\):
\[

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16)

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9

To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[

\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent of \(x\), so we can write:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, let's define the weights of the objects in terms of the weight of a sc sko. Let's denote the weight of a sc sko as \( S \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The weight of a tricycle is equal to the weight of three sc skos and one gold. Therefore, the weight of a tricycle is \( 3S + G \), where \( G \) is the weight of a gold.
2. The weight of a tricycle is equal to the weight of two sc skos and one gold. Therefore, the weight of a tricycle is also \( 2S + G \).

Since both expressions represent the weight of a tricycle, we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 3S + G = 2S + G \]

To eliminate \( G \) from both sides of the equation, we subtract \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 3S = 2S \]

Next, we subtract \( 2S \) from both sides:
\[ S = 0 \]

This result implies that the weight of a sc sko is 0. However, this interpretation seems incorrect because it would imply that a sc sko has no weight, which is not a practical scenario. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct interpretation of the relationships.

The correct interpretation should be that the weight of a tricycle is equal to the weight of three sc skos and one gold, and the weight of a tricycle is equal to the weight of two sc skos and one gold. This means that the weight of a gold is equal to the weight of one sc sko. Therefore, \( G = S \).

Now, we need to find the total weight of three tricycles. Since the weight of one tricycle is \( 3S + S = 4S \), the weight of three tricycles is:
\[ 3 \times 4S = 12S \]

We need to find how many sc skos have the same weight as three tricycles. Since the weight of one sc sko is \( S \), the number of sc skos that have the same weight as three tricycles is:
\[ \frac{12S}{S} = 12 \]

Therefore, the total weight of three tricycles is equal to the weight of \(\boxed{12}\) sc skos.","[12, '12']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\).

Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the spherical tank, we need to use the information given about the volume and the surface area of the tank. The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. The surface area \( A \) of a sphere is given by the formula:

\[ A = 4 \pi r^2 \]

We are given that the volume of the tank is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters and the surface area is \( 4\pi \) square meters. Let's start with the surface area formula:

\[ 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi \]

We can divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ r^2 = 1 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ r = 1 \]

To verify, we can substitute \( r = 1 \) back into the volume formula:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (1)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \]

However, we are given that the volume is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, so there must be a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct volume and surface area.

Given the correct volume \( V = 20\pi \) cubic meters, we use the volume formula:

\[ \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 = 20\pi \]

We can divide both sides of the equation by \( \pi \):

\[ \frac{4}{3} r^3 = 20 \]

Multiplying both sides by \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[ r^3 = 15 \]

Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:

Now, let's verify the surface area with \( r = \sqrt[3]{15} \):

\[ A = 4 \pi (\sqrt[3]{15})^2 = 4 \pi \sqrt[3]{225} \]

"To determine the value of \(a\) for which the function \(f(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line at exactly one point, we need to analyze the function and its derivative.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the derivative of \(f(x)\):
\[ f'(x) =
\begin{cases}
2ax & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

A horizontal tangent line occurs where the derivative is zero. Therefore, we need to find the values of \(x\) for which \(f'(x) = 0\).

1. For \(x \geq a\), \(f'(x) = 2ax\). Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[ 2ax = 0. \]
Since \(a \neq 0\), the only solution is \(x = 0\). However, \(x = 0\) is not in the domain \(x \geq a\). Therefore, there is no horizontal tangent line in this interval.

2. For \(x < a\), \(f'(x) = a\). Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[ a = 0. \]
However, \(a \neq 0\), so there is no horizontal tangent line in this interval either.

Since there is no value of \(x\) that satisfies \(f'(x) = 0\) for any \(a \neq 0\), we need to consider the point where the function changes from one piece to the other, which is at \(x = a\). At \(x = a\), the left-hand derivative is \(a\) and the right-hand derivative is \(2a^2\). For the function to have a horizontal tangent line at \(x = a\), these derivatives must be equal:
\[ a = 2a^2. \]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ 2a^2 - a = 0, \]
\[ a(2a - 1) = 0. \]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we have:
\[ 2a - 1 = 0, \]
\[ a = \frac{1}{2}. \]

Therefore, the value of \(a\) for which the function \(f(x)\) has a horizontal tangent line at exactly one point is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given equation represents a circle with a radius of 1, we start with the equation:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

First, we need to rewrite this equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). To do this, we complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \( r = 1 \):
\[ 1^2 = 34 - c \]
\[ 1 = 34 - c \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \( x \in [0,1] \) such that \( f(x) \neq x \) but \( f(f(x)) = x \). The function \( f \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \( f(f(x)) \). Let \( y = f(x) \). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

Now, we apply \( f \) to \( y \):

\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need this to equal \( x \):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \( z = \lambda x(1 - x) \). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda z(1 - z) = x. \]

Since \( z = \lambda x(1 - x) \), we substitute \( z \) back into the equation:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

This is a quartic equation in \( x \). To find the values of \( x \) that satisfy this equation, we need to consider the specific values of \( \lambda \) and solve the equation accordingly. However, we can use a known result for this type of function. The function \( f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x) \) has a fixed point at \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \) for any \( \lambda \). The other fixed points are given by the solutions to the equation:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

So, the solutions are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \). For \( f(f(x)) = x \) and \( f(x) \neq x \), we need \( x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \) to be in the interval \( (0,1) \). This is true for \( 1 < \lambda < 4 \).

(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Now, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will analyze the function and its behavior at the boundary points and critical points.

First, let's consider the boundary points. The boundary points of the domain are the points where \( x \) or \( y \) take the values \( \pm 1 \).

1. If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), and it is \( \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \).
2. If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), and it is \( -\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1 \).
3. If \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), and it is \( \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \).
4. If \( y = -1 \), then \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), and it is \( -\sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1 \).

From the above, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) at the boundary points is 1.

Next, let's consider the critical points inside the domain. To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = y^2 x^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]
From the second equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]
Thus, the critical points satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), which means they lie on the boundary of the domain. Therefore, the critical points do not provide any new values for \( f(x, y) \) other than the boundary values.

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), the cross product is:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2) \\ 3 \cdot (-3) - 1 \cdot 1 \\ 1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 + 6 \\ -9 - 1 \\ -2 + 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are the golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).

Since \( z \) can be either \( \phi \) or \( \frac{1}{\phi} \), we will consider both cases. However, the expression \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) will be the same regardless of whether \( z = \phi \) or \( z = \frac{1}{\phi} \). Therefore, we can assume \( z = \phi \).

The golden ratio \( \phi \) satisfies the property \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). We can use this property to find higher powers of \( \phi \):
\[
\phi^3 = \phi \cdot \phi^2 = \phi(\phi + 1) = \phi^2 + \phi = (\phi + 1) + \phi = 2\phi + 1,
\]
\[
\phi^4 = \phi \cdot \phi^3 = \phi(2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2.
\]
We observe that the powers of \( \phi \) can be expressed in the form \( F_n \phi + F_{n-1} \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. To confirm this, we use induction. The base cases \( n = 1 \) and \( n = 2 \) are true since \( \phi^1 = \phi \) and \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). Assume \( \phi^k = F_k \phi + F_{k-1} \) and \( \phi^{k+1} = F_{k+1} \phi + F_k \). Then,
\[
\phi^{k+2} = \phi \cdot \phi^{k+1} = \phi(F_{k+1} \phi + F_k) = F_{k+1} \phi^2 + F_k \phi = F_{k+1}(\phi + 1) + F_k \phi = (F_{k+1} + F_k) \phi + F_{k+1} = F_{k+2} \phi + F_{k+1}.
\]
Thus, the property holds for all \( n \).

Therefore, \( \phi^{85} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} = \frac{1}{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 (\phi + 1) + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 (\phi + 1) + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{(F_{85} \phi + F_{84})^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \frac{F_{85} \phi + F_{84}}{F_{85}^2 \phi + F_{85}^2 + 2 F_{85} F_{84} \phi + F_{84}^2} = \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \). \boxed{1} \).","[1, '1']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"To find the area of triangle \(MEN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(G\) is the centroid, it is also the intersection of the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\). The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). This line segment \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and is one-third the length of \(BC\) because \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, and the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) will create a smaller triangle \(AMN\) that is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of 1:3.

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its corresponding side lengths. Since \(MN\) is one-third the length of \(BC\), the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16

The area of triangle \(MEN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\).

Thus, the area of triangle \(MEN\) is:

"To determine the number of mathematical books remaining after each shelf has lost two books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of books on each shelf.
2. Determine the number of books remaining on each shelf after losing two books.
3. Sum the remaining books on all three shelves.
4. Find the fraction of the total remaining books that are mathematical.

First, let's find the initial number of books on each shelf. The total number of books is 24, and there are three shelves. Therefore, the initial number of books on each shelf is:
\[ \text{Initial number of books per shelf} = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \]

Next, we determine the number of books remaining on each shelf after losing two books:
- For the first shelf, which has 8 books initially, after losing 2 books, the remaining number of books is:
  \[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]
- For the second shelf, which has 8 books initially, after losing 2 books, the remaining number of books is:
  \[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]
- For the third shelf, which has 8 books initially, after losing 2 books, the remaining number of books is:
  \[ 8 - 2 = 6 \]

Now, we sum the remaining books on all three shelves:
\[ 6 + 6 + 6 = 18 \]

The total number of remaining books is 18. The number of mathematical books remaining is 10 (since only the second shelf has mathematical books). Therefore, the fraction of the total remaining books that are mathematical is:
\[ \frac{10}{18} = \frac{5}{9} \]

"To determine the median of a dataset, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of data points in the dataset.
2. Determine the position of the median in the ordered list of data points.
3. If the number of data points is odd, the median is the middle number. If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

However, the problem does not provide the actual data points, only the minimum and maximum values. Without the actual data points, we cannot determine the exact median. But if we assume that the dataset is ordered and contains at least 3 data points (since the minimum and maximum are given), the median would be the middle value.

Given that the minimum value is $200$ and the maximum value is $500$, if we assume the dataset has an odd number of data points, the median would be the middle value. If the dataset has an even number of data points, the median would be the average of the two middle values.

   \[
   2^2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   5^7 = 78125
   \]
   So, the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}

"To find the positive integer factors of 100 and 150, we will first determine the prime factorizations of each number and then use these factorizations to list all the factors.

**Step 1: Prime factorization of 100**

100 can be divided by 2:
\[ 100 \div 2 = 50 \]
50 can be divided by 2:
\[ 50 \div 2 = 25 \]
25 can be divided by 5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]
5 can be divided by 5:
\[ 5 \div 5 = 1 \]

So, the prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

**Step 2: Finding the factors of 100**

To find the factors, we take all possible products of the prime factors:
\[ 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 \]

So, the positive integer factors of 100 are:
\[ 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 \]

**Step 3: Prime factorization of 150**

150 can be divided by 2:
\[ 150 \div 2 = 75 \]
75 can be divided by 3:
\[ 75 \div 3 = 25 \]
25 can be divided by 5:
\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]
5 can be divided by 5:
\[ 5 \div 5 = 1 \]

So, the prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

**Step 4: Finding the factors of 150**

To find the factors, we take all possible products of the prime factors:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150 \]

So, the positive integer factors of 150 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150 \]

**Step 5: Finding the common factors of 100 and 150**

We compare the lists of factors of 100 and 150:

\[ \text{Factors of 150: } 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150 \]

The common factors are:
\[ 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 \]

So, the positive integer factors of 100 and 150 are:

"To determine the positive integer \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find \( n \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) for which \( 2^{24} = k^n \).

First, we express \( 2^{24} \) as a power of 2:
\[ 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 = 8^8. \]
This shows that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 8th power.

Next, we consider the general form of \( 2^{24} \). For \( 2^{24} \) to be a perfect \( n \)-th power, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \]
Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. Therefore, the possible values for \( n \) are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \]

We need to verify that for each of these values of \( n \), \( 2^{24} \) is indeed a perfect \( n \)-th power:
- For \( n = 2 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 2nd power.
- For \( n = 3 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 3rd power.
- For \( n = 4 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 4th power.
- For \( n = 6 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^4)^6 \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 6th power.
- For \( n = 8 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^3)^8 \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 8th power.
- For \( n = 12 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 12th power.
- For \( n = 24 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} \), so \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect 24th power.

Thus, the positive integer \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is any of the divisors of 24 except 1. The problem asks for a specific \( n \), and the smallest such \( n \) is 2.

"To determine the cost of the notebook, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the cost of the pen.
2. Determine the cost of the pencil.
3. Calculate the total cost of the pen and the pencil.
4. Subtract the total cost of the pen and the pencil from the total cost of the notebook, pen, and pencil.

Given:
- The cost of the pen is 150 rupees.
- The cost of the pencil is 75 rupees.
- The total cost of the notebook, pen, and pencil is 75 rupees.

First, let's find the total cost of the pen and the pencil:
\[ \text{Total cost of the pen and the pencil} = 150 + 75 = 225 \text{ rupees} \]

Next, we subtract this total from the total cost of the notebook, pen, and pencil to find the cost of the notebook:
\[ \text{Cost of the notebook} = 75 - 225 = -150 \text{ rupees} \]

However, this result is not possible because the cost of the notebook cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

If the total cost of the notebook, pen, and pencil is 75 rupees, and the cost of the pen is 150 rupees and the cost of the pencil is 75 rupees, then the cost of the notebook should be:
\[ \text{Cost of the notebook} = 75 - 225 = -150 \text{ rupees} \]

This result is not possible because the cost of the notebook cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

If the total cost of the notebook, pen, and pencil is 75 rupees, and the cost of the pen is 150 rupees and the cost of the pencil is 75 rupees, then the cost of the notebook should be:

This result is not possible because the cost of the notebook cannot be negative. Therefore, there must be a mistake in the problem statement or the interpretation of the problem.

The correct interpretation should be that the cost of the notebook is 75 - 225 = -150 rupees, which is not possible. Therefore, the problem is not solvable as stated.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the two randomly selected numbers from the first 10 natural numbers is a multiple of 7, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the first 10 natural numbers:**
   The first 10 natural numbers are: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10\).

2. **Calculate the total number of ways to select 2 numbers from these 10:**
   The number of ways to choose 2 numbers from 10 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{10}{2} \):
   \[
   \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45
   \]

3. **Identify the pairs whose sum is a multiple of 7:**
   We need to find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\). This means \(a + b = 7k\) for some integer \(k\). Since \(a\) and \(b\) are between 1 and 10, the only possible value for \(k\) is 1, so \(a + b = 7\).

   Now, we list all pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a + b = 7\):
   - If \(a = 1\), then \(b = 6\)
   - If \(a = 2\), then \(b = 5\)
   - If \(a = 3\), then \(b = 4\)
   - If \(a = 4\), then \(b = 3\)
   - If \(a = 5\), then \(b = 2\)
   - If \(a = 6\), then \(b = 1\)

   The pairs are: \((1, 6)\), \((2, 5)\), \((3, 4)\), \((4, 3)\), \((5, 2)\), \((6, 1)\).

   Note that the pairs \((4, 3)\), \((5, 2)\), and \((6, 1)\) are the same as \((3, 4)\), \((2, 5)\), and \((1, 6)\) respectively, so we only count each unique pair once. Therefore, the unique pairs are: \((1, 6)\), \((2, 5)\), \((3, 4)\).

   There are 3 such pairs.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{45} = \frac{1}{15}

"To determine the total rent collected from the bar, we need to calculate the area of each filled portion of the rectangle and then sum these areas. The rectangle is divided into two smaller rectangles by a diagonal, and each smaller rectangle has a different rent rate.

First, let's identify the dimensions and areas of the two smaller rectangles:
1. The top rectangle has a width of 2 units and a height of 4 units. The area of this rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area}_{\text{top}} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ square units}

2. The bottom rectangle has a width of 1 unit (since the total width of the original rectangle is 3 units and the top rectangle takes up 2 units) and a height of 4 units. The area of this rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area}_{\text{bottom}} = 1 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}

Next, we calculate the rent collected from each rectangle. The rent rate for the top rectangle is 3 units per square unit, and the rent rate for the bottom rectangle is 2 units per square unit.
1. The rent collected from the top rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Rent}_{\text{top}} = 8 \times 3 = 24 \text{ units}

2. The rent collected from the bottom rectangle is:
   \[
   \text{Rent}_{\text{bottom}} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ units}

Finally, we sum the rents collected from both rectangles to get the total rent:
\[

A multiple of 450 must include at least one factor of 2, one factor of 3, and two factors of 5. To maximize the number while ensuring that all digits are zero except one, we should use the largest digit, which is 9. The number 9 can be expressed as \( 3^2 \), so we can use two factors of 3.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the process of generating the two random numbers and then determine the probability that the third number (the corner of the chessboard) is a prime number.

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Generate the Two Random Numbers:**
   - The first number is obtained by dividing the roll result by 4 and taking the remainder. This gives a number between 0 and 3.
   - The second number is obtained by dividing the roll result by 5 and taking the remainder. This gives a number between 0 and 4.

2. **Determine the Chessboard Corner:**
   - The chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the corners are at positions (1,1), (1,8), (8,1), and (8,8).
   - The first number (from the first roll) corresponds to the row (1-based index), and the second number (from the second roll) corresponds to the column (1-based index).
   - Therefore, the chessboard corner is at position \((\text{first number} + 1, \text{second number} + 1)\).

3. **Check if the Chessboard Corner is a Prime Number:**
   - The numbers on a chessboard are from 1 to 64. We need to check if the number at the corner position is a prime number.

### Identify the Possible Corner Numbers:
- The possible row numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- The possible column numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.
- Therefore, the possible corner numbers are the numbers at positions (1,1), (1,8), (8,1), and (8,8), which are 1, 8, 8, and 1 respectively.

### Check for Prime Numbers:
- The number 1 is not a prime number.
- The number 8 is not a prime number.

Since none of the possible corner numbers are prime, the probability that the third number (the corner of the chessboard) is a prime number is 0.

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape represented by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation means in Cartesian coordinates.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). The polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15

From Vieta's formulas, we know that for the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is equal to the coefficient of \( x^2 \) with the opposite sign, which is 49. Therefore:
\[

Substituting this into the expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[

\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the lines, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can use \(\mathbf{d}_1\) as the direction vector. Let's choose \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = 31 \mathbf{i} - 6 \mathbf{j} + 58 \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(D\) is:

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Thus, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine the number of lattice points inside the rectangle defined by the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to count all the points \((x,y)\) where \(x\) and \(y\) are integers and satisfy the inequalities \(-5 < x < 5\) and \(-4 < y < 4\).

First, let's identify the range for \(x\) and \(y\):
- The \(x\)-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\), but since \(x\) must be strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\), \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\). This gives us \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible values for \(x\).
- The \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\), but since \(y\) must be strictly between \(-4\) and \(4\), \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\). This gives us \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible values for \(y\).

To find the total number of lattice points inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the angles in \(\triangle ACD\):
- Let \(\angle CAD = \theta\).
- Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\angle BAD = 2\theta\).

Given that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Therefore, in \(\triangle ACD\), the angles are \(\theta\), \(90^\circ\), and \(90^\circ - \theta\).

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Next, we need to find the lengths of \(AD\) and \(CD\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we can use the fact that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42. The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot h
\]
where \(h\) is the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\) is the same as the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\), which is \(CD\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot CD
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) is equal to the ratio of their bases:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD}
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) is the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = [\triangle ACD]
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside the circle, we need to consider the geometric properties of chords in a circle. Two chords intersect inside the circle if and only if the endpoints of one chord alternate with the endpoints of the other chord around the circle. In other words, if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are in one of the following orders: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their rotations and reflections).

Let's denote the points on the circle as \(A, B, C, D\) in a clockwise order. The total number of ways to choose 4 points in a circle is \(4!\) (since we can fix one point and arrange the other three around it), but since the circle has no starting point, we divide by 4, giving us \(3!\) ways to arrange the points. However, we need to consider that each arrangement of points can be reflected, so we divide by 2, giving us \(\frac{3!}{2} = 3\) distinct arrangements of points.

For each arrangement of points, there are 2 ways to pair them into chords such that the chords intersect (as described above). Therefore, the total number of ways to pair the points into chords such that the chords intersect is \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

The total number of ways to pair the points into chords is \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) (since we choose 2 points out of 4 to be one chord, and the other 2 points automatically form the other chord).

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside the circle is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of circles and the fact that the sum of the angles subtended by a chord at the circumference is constant.

Given:
- Two circles with centers \(D\).
- The radii of the circles are \(r_1\) and \(r_2\).
- The chords subtend angles \(1\) and \(2\) at the circumference of the respective circles.
- The total area of the sectors subtended by these chords is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's denote the angles subtended by the chords at the centers of the circles as \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). The angles subtended at the circumferences are \(\frac{\theta_1}{2}\) and \(\frac{\theta_2}{2}\).

The area of the sector subtended by the chord in the first circle is:
\[

\]

The area of the sector subtended by the chord in the second circle is:

The total area of the sectors is:
\[

We are given that this total area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Without loss of generality, let's assume \(r_2 > r_1\). The area of the larger circle is:

Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} r_1^2 \theta_1 + \frac{1}{2} r_2^2 \theta_2 = \frac{5}{12} \pi r_2^2
\]

Since the angles subtended at the circumferences are \(\frac{\theta_1}{2}\) and \(\frac{\theta_2}{2}\), we can use the fact that the sum of the angles subtended by a chord at the circumference is constant. Therefore, the sum of the angles subtended at the centers is:

\[
r_1^2 \alpha + r_2^2 \beta = \frac{5}{12} \pi r_2^2

Since \(\alpha + \beta = \frac{\pi}{2}\), we can solve for \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\). However, we need to find the specific values of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) that satisfy the given area condition. Let's assume \(\alpha = \frac{\pi}{6}\) and \(\beta = \frac{\pi}{3}\). Then:
\[
r_1^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) + r_2^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{5}{12} \pi r_2^2

\[
\frac{r_1^2}{6} = \frac{5}{12} r_2^2 - \frac{2}{12} r_2^2

\]
\[
\frac{r_1^2}{6} = \frac{1}{4} r_2^2

Now, substitute this back into the volume formula:

Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Therefore, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Now, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways we can form a team of 5 players from a group of 8 rowers and 6 players such that each player on the team is from a different rowing team.

First, we need to choose 5 rowing teams from the 8 rowing teams. The number of ways to choose 5 rowing teams from 8 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{8}{5} \).

Next, we need to choose 1 player from each of the 5 chosen rowing teams. Since each rowing team has at least 1 player, the number of ways to choose 1 player from each of the 5 rowing teams is the product of the number of players in each of the 5 rowing teams. However, since the problem does not specify the exact number of players in each rowing team, we assume that each rowing team has at least 1 player, and the number of ways to choose 1 player from each of the 5 rowing teams is simply the product of the number of players in each of the 5 rowing teams.

Therefore, the total number of ways to form the team is the product of the number of ways to choose 5 rowing teams and the number of ways to choose 1 player from each of the 5 rowing teams.

The number of ways to choose 5 rowing teams from 8 is:
\[ \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56 \]

Since each rowing team has at least 1 player, the number of ways to choose 1 player from each of the 5 rowing teams is the product of the number of players in each of the 5 rowing teams, which is at least 1.

Therefore, the total number of ways to form the team is:
\[ 56 \times 1 = 56 \]

Thus, the number of ways to form a team of 5 players such that each player on the team is from a different rowing team is:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is \(\boxed{26000}\).","[26000, '26000']",26000,"[26000, '26000']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find three numbers whose product is 120 and whose average is 24. Let's denote the three numbers by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). According to the problem, we have two key pieces of information:

1. The product of the three numbers is 120:
   \[
   abc = 120
   \]

2. The average of the three numbers is 24:
   \[
   \frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24 \implies a + b + c = 72
   \]

We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations and then determine the largest of the three numbers.

First, let's consider the factorization of 120. The possible sets of factors of 120 are:
\[
(1, 1, 120), (1, 2, 60), (1, 3, 40), (1, 4, 30), (1, 5, 24), (1, 6, 20), (1, 8, 15), (1, 10, 12), (2, 2, 30), (2, 3, 20), (2, 4, 15), (2, 5, 12), (2, 6, 10), (3, 4, 10), (3, 5, 8), (4, 5, 6)
\]

Next, we check which of these sets also satisfy the sum condition \(a + b + c = 72\):
- For \((1, 1, 120)\): \(1 + 1 + 120 = 122 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 2, 60)\): \(1 + 2 + 60 = 63 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 3, 40)\): \(1 + 3 + 40 = 44 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 4, 30)\): \(1 + 4 + 30 = 35 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 5, 24)\): \(1 + 5 + 24 = 30 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 6, 20)\): \(1 + 6 + 20 = 27 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 8, 15)\): \(1 + 8 + 15 = 24 \neq 72\)
- For \((1, 10, 12)\): \(1 + 10 + 12 = 23 \neq 72\)
- For \((2, 2, 30)\): \(2 + 2 + 30 = 34 \neq 72\)
- For \((2, 3, 20)\): \(2 + 3 + 20 = 25 \neq 72\)
- For \((2, 4, 15)\): \(2 + 4 + 15 = 21 \neq 72\)
- For \((2, 5, 12)\): \(2 + 5 + 12 = 19 \neq 72\)
- For \((2, 6, 10)\): \(2 + 6 + 10 = 18 \neq 72\)
- For \((3, 4, 10)\): \(3 + 4 + 10 = 17 \neq 72\)

- For \((4, 5, 6)\): \(4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \neq 72\)

None of the sets of three factors of 120 satisfy both conditions except for the set \((5, 6, 4)\) which is the same as \((4, 5, 6)\) and their sum is 15. Therefore, the correct set is \((5, 6, 4)\).

The largest of these three numbers is 6.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
   \]

5. Since we are asked to find the solution for \(x\) when \(x\) is positive, we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the solution is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right)\). We use the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]

Setting \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.

Therefore, the original expression is:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), and \( AD = 10 \) with \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = 180^\circ - 2\theta \) and \( \angle CMA = 180^\circ - 2\theta \).

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC}
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
BD = CD = \frac{BC \sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \( BD + CD = BC \), we have:
\[
2 \frac{BC \sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}}{\sin 3\theta} = BC
\]
\[
2 \sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} = \sin 3\theta
\]
Using the identity \( \sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \) and \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \), we get:
\[
2 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]
Using the identity \( \sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \), we substitute:
\[
2 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = 3 (2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}) - 4 (2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2})^3
\]
\[
2 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = 6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 32 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} \cos^3 \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
Dividing both sides by \( 2 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \) (assuming \( \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \neq 0 \)):
\[
1 = 3 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} - 16 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
Using the identity \( \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} \):
\[
1 = 3 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} - 16 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} (1 - \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2})
\]
\[
1 = 3 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} - 16 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2} + 16 \sin^5 \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
Let \( x = \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \). Then:
\[
1 = 3x - 16x^3 + 16x^5
\]
By trial, we find that \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is a root:
\[
1 = 3 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) - 16 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^3 + 16 \left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^5
\]
\[
1 = \frac{3}{2} - 1 + \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]
So, \( \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{1}{2} \), which means \( \frac{\theta}{2} = 30^\circ \) and \( \theta = 60^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 180^\circ \), which is not possible. However, we can use the fact that \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \).

In \( \triangle ABC \), since \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 75^\circ \), we can use the Law of Sines:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{AB}{\sin 75^\circ} = \frac{AC}{\sin 75^\circ}
\]
\[
\frac{BC}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{AB}{\sin 75^\circ}
\]
\[
BC = \frac{AB}{\sin 75^\circ}
\]
Since \( AB = AC \) and \( \sin 75^\circ = \sin 105^\circ = \sin 75^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} \):
\[
BC = \frac{AB}{\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}} = \frac{4AB}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{4AB (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})}{4} = AB (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})
\]
The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = AB + AB + AB (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) = AB (2 + \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})
\]
Since \( AM = 11 \) and \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( AM \) is the altitude from \( A \) to \( BC \):
\[
AM = AB \sin 75^\circ = AB \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} = 11
\]
\[
AB = \frac{44}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{44 (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})}{4} = 11 (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})
\]
The perimeter is:
\[
AB (2 + \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) = 11 (\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) (2 + \sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}) = 11 (2\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{2} + 6 - 2\sqrt{3} - \sqrt{12} + 2) = 11 (2\sqrt{6} - 2\sqrt{2} + 6 - 2\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{3} + 2) = 11 (2\sqrt{6} - 4\sqrt{3} - 2\sqrt{2} + 8) = 22\sqrt{6} - 44\sqrt{3} - 22\sqrt{2} + 88

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\]

Notice that the left-hand side can be factored as a perfect square:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\]

The expression \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number, and the square of any real number is always non-negative. Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always greater than 0 for all real \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\]

We can factor the left-hand side as follows:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = (x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3)\]

So the inequality becomes:
\[(x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\]

Since \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real \(x\) (because \(x^2 \geq 0\) and adding 7 makes it positive), the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to:
\[x^2 - 3 < 0\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[x^2 < 3\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\). From Step 2, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is true for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[
s = 4.

"To determine which jamاعت has the number of lances closest to 135% of the number of lances in the 11th jamاعت, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of lances in the 11th jamاعت.
2. Calculate 135% of the number of lances in the 11th jamاعت.
3. Calculate the number of lances in each of the other jamاعت and compare them to the value obtained in step 2.

First, let's find the number of lances in the 11th jamاعت. The 11th jamاعت has 300 lances and 13.8% of them are lances. Therefore, the number of lances is:
\[
\text{Number of lances in the 11th jamاعت} = 300
\]

Next, we calculate 135% of the number of lances in the 11th jamاعت:
\[
135\% \text{ of } 300 = 1.35 \times 300 = 405
\]

Now, we calculate the number of lances in each of the other jamاعت and compare them to 405.

- For the 9th jamاعت, the number of lances is:
\[
\text{Number of lances in the 9th jamاعت} = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3
\]
- For the 10th jamاعت, the number of lances is:
\[

- For the 12th jamاعت, the number of lances is:
\[
\text{Number of lances in the 12th jamاعت} = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8

Now, we compare these values to 405:
- The difference between 123.3 and 405 is:
\[
405 - 123.3 = 281.7
\]
- The difference between 103.2 and 405 is:
\[
405 - 103.2 = 301.8
\]
- The difference between 34.8 and 405 is:
\[
405 - 34.8 = 370.2

The smallest difference is 281.7, which corresponds to the 9th jamاعت. Therefore, the jamاعت with the number of lances closest to 135% of the number of lances in the 11th jamاعت is the \boxed{9th} jamاعت.","[9*h*t, '9th']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\).
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\).
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\).
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we need to consider the constraints given in the problem. The rectangular field has a perimeter of 400 meters, and the field is divided into two equal parts by a diagonal, with each part having a perimeter of 200 meters.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The perimeter of the rectangle is given by:
\[
2l + 2w = 400
\]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[
l + w = 200
\]

Next, we need to consider the perimeter of one of the two equal parts of the rectangle. Each part is a right triangle with sides \( l \), \( w \), and the diagonal \( d \). The perimeter of one part is:
\[
l + w + d = 200
\]
Since \( l + w = 200 \), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
200 + d = 200
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
d = 0
\]
However, this is not possible because the diagonal \( d \) must be greater than zero. Therefore, we need to consider the correct interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation is that the diagonal \( d \) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the length and width, and the perimeter of one part is the sum of the two legs and the hypotenuse:
\[
l + w + \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} = 200
\]
Substituting \( w = 200 - l \) into the equation, we get:
\[
l + (200 - l) + \sqrt{l^2 + (200 - l)^2} = 200
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
200 + \sqrt{l^2 + (200 - l)^2} = 200
\]
Subtracting 200 from both sides, we get:
\[
\sqrt{l^2 + (200 - l)^2} = 0
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\sqrt{l^2 + 40000 - 400l + l^2} = 0
\]
\[
\sqrt{2l^2 - 400l + 40000} = 0
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
2l^2 - 400l + 40000 = 0
\]
Dividing the entire equation by 2, we get:
\[
l^2 - 200l + 20000 = 0
\]
We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( l = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -200 \), and \( c = 20000 \):
\[
l = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{200^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 20000}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
l = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{40000 - 80000}}{2}
\]
\[
l = \frac{200 \pm \sqrt{0}}{2}
\]
\[
l = \frac{200}{2}
\]
\[
l = 100
\]
Since \( l = 100 \), we substitute this back into the equation \( w = 200 - l \):
\[
w = 200 - 100
\]
\[
w = 100
\]
Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle are 100 meters by 100 meters, which means the rectangle is actually a square. The area of the square is:
\[
\text{Area} = l \times w = 100 \times 100 = 10000

Thus, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\). The given information is \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, for \(\angle R\), we have:

\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

This means that the length of the opposite side \(ST\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse \(RT\) is 5 units. To find the length of the adjacent side \(RS\), we use the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

\[

"To find the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) that is closest to the origin, we need to minimize the distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(D\) between these two points is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since minimizing \(D\) is equivalent to minimizing \(D^2\), we can instead minimize the function:

\[ f(x) = x^2 + y^2 \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the function, we get:

\[ f(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 \]
\[ f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2 \]
\[ f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) \]
\[ f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions:

\[ x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

1. For \(x = 0\):
\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We now find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinates:

For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Thus, the points on the curve closest to the origin are \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\). The distance from either point to the origin is:

\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Therefore, the minimum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), and in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). The sum \(a + b\) is:

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6

   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   -3^3 + 2 \cdot 3^2 + 3 \cdot 3 = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0 \neq 6

   Testing \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6

   Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6

   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 2 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

For \(1165_8\):
\[1 \cdot 8^3 + 1 \cdot 8^2 + 6 \cdot 8^1 + 5 \cdot 8^0 = 1 \cdot 512 + 1 \cdot 64 + 6 \cdot 8 + 5 \cdot 1 = 512 + 64 + 48 + 5 = 629\]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of real roots of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is the same as the number of real roots of the polynomial \( f(x-1) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

First, we need to find the number of real roots of \( f(x) \). We can use the derivative of \( f(x) \) to analyze its critical points and behavior. The derivative of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ f'(x) = 12x^3 + 10x - 9. \]

To find the critical points, we need to solve the equation \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[ 12x^3 + 10x - 9 = 0. \]

This is a cubic equation, and a cubic equation can have up to three real roots. We can use numerical methods or graphing to approximate the roots, but for the purpose of this problem, we will use the fact that a cubic polynomial always has at least one real root. Therefore, \( f'(x) \) has at least one real root, which means \( f(x) \) has at most two critical points (since a cubic polynomial can have at most three real roots, and if it has three, it must change direction at two points).

Next, we need to determine the number of real roots of \( f(x) \) by analyzing the behavior of \( f(x) \) at its critical points and at infinity. Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4 with a positive leading coefficient, it will go to infinity as \( x \) goes to both positive and negative infinity. The critical points will determine the local maxima and minima of \( f(x) \), and the number of real roots will depend on the values of \( f(x) \) at these critical points.

By graphing or using numerical methods, we can approximate the roots of \( f(x) \). It turns out that \( f(x) \) has two real roots and two complex conjugate roots. This can be confirmed by evaluating \( f(x) \) at some points and using the intermediate value theorem.

Since \( g(x) \) is the same as \( f(x-1) \), the number of real roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the number of real roots of \( f(x) \). Therefore, \( g(x) \) has two real roots.

\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

Let \(P = \alpha_3 + \alpha_4\) and \(Q = \alpha_3\alpha_4\). Then:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The vertices are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by the inequalities:
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, A), \]
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, B), \]
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, C), \]
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, D), \]
where \(d(P, Q)\) is the distance between points \(P\) and \(Q\).

These inequalities describe the regions inside the rectangle that are closer to \(O\) than to any vertex. The boundary of each region is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining \(O\) and the corresponding vertex. These perpendicular bisectors form a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to the sides of \(ABCD\).

The side length of this smaller rectangle is half the length of the corresponding side of \(ABCD\). Since \(AB = k \cdot AD\), the side length of the smaller rectangle is \(\frac{k}{2} \cdot AD\) in the direction of \(AB\) and \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot AD\) in the direction of \(AD\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

The Fermat point of a triangle with sides \( a = 6 \), \( b = 5 \), and \( c = 4 \) can also be found using the formula for the Fermat point of a triangle. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the Fermat point of a triangle is the point where the angles between the sides are all \( 120^\circ \). We can check if this point is also the Fermat point of the quadrilateral by considering the distances to the other vertices \( B \) and \( D \).

By symmetry and the fact that the distances from \( D \) to \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) are \( 5 \), \( 3 \), and \( 4 \) respectively, and the distances from \( A \) to \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) are \( 6 \), \( 6 \), and \( 5 \) respectively, we can conclude that the point \( D \) is the Fermat point of the quadrilateral \( ABCD \).

Therefore, the point \( P \) that minimizes the sum of the distances from \( P \) to the points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \) is \( D \).

The answer is \(\boxed{D}\).","[D, 'D']",13,"[13, '13']",False
