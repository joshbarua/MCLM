"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(EF\) intersects \(EF\), and \(F\) is the point on the x-axis directly below \(D\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this triangle, \(DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2\). Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the squares, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) counterclockwise of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by multiplying it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1, \quad \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i, \quad (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3i = \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \right)i, \quad (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (3 - 3 \sqrt{2}) \cdot i^2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = (3 - 3 \sqrt{2}) \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 = \left( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 \right)
   \]
   Adding these terms together:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \right)i + \left( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 \right) = 1 + 3 + \left( 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)i = 4 + i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that 3 specific people (BIYER, RIZEA, and TOMAS) sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat BIYER, RIZEA, and TOMAS as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the BIYER-RIZEA-TOMAS block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 ""people"" around a circular table.** The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange BIYER, RIZEA, and TOMAS within their block.** There are 3! = 6 ways to arrange BIYER, RIZEA, and TOMAS within their block.

4. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" by the number of ways to arrange BIYER, RIZEA, and TOMAS within their block.** This gives us \( 120 \times 6 = 720 \).

Thus, the number of distinct ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that BIYER, RIZEA, and TOMAS sit next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated counterclockwise around the center of a regular polygon so that it matches its original position, we need to consider the properties of rotational symmetry of regular polygons.

A regular polygon with \( n \) sides has rotational symmetry of order \( n \). This means that it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) degrees and still look the same. To find the minimum number of degrees required to return the polygon to its original position, we need to consider the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( k \cdot \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) is a multiple of \( 360^\circ \).

Since \( k \cdot \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) must be a multiple of \( 360^\circ \), \( k \) must be a multiple of \( n \). The smallest positive \( k \) is \( n \), so the minimum number of degrees required to return the polygon to its original position is \( n \cdot \frac{360^\circ}{n} = 360^\circ \).

However, the problem asks for the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated counterclockwise, which is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated counterclockwise around the center of a regular polygon with \( n \) sides so that it matches its original position is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).

The answer is \(\boxed{360}\).","[360, '360']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, and the horizontal asymptote can be found by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity.

First, let's factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}. \]
The vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, which are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, the horizontal asymptote depends on the relationship between \( n \) and \( m \):
- If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
- If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
- If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In our function, the degree of the numerator \( P(x) = 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we add \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[9 + 8 = 17.\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalent of \(18_9\) from the base \(10\) equivalent of \(58_9\):
\[53 - 17 = 36.\]

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.

\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of the total collection of tricrons and compare it to the weight of one tricron. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the weight of one tricron:**
   - One tricron consists of 10 tricorns, each weighing 3 grams and 1 gram.
   - Therefore, the weight of one tricron is:
     \[
     10 \times (3 + 1) = 10 \times 4 = 40 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Identify the weight of two tricrons and one tricron:**
   - Two tricrons consist of 20 tricorns, each weighing 3 grams and 1 gram.
   - Therefore, the weight of two tricrons is:
     \[
     2 \times 40 = 80 \text{ grams}

   - Adding one tricron to the two tricrons gives:

     \]

3. **Determine if the total weight of the tricrons is equal to the weight of one tricron:**
   - The weight of one tricron is 40 grams.
   - The weight of two tricrons and one tricron is 120 grams.
   - Clearly, 120 grams is not equal to 40 grams.

Therefore, the weight of the total collection of tricrons is not equal to the weight of one tricron. The correct answer is \(\boxed{\text{No}}\).","[No, '\\text{No}']",3,"[3, '3']",False

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
3b = 6
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
b = 2
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
Simplify:
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4a = -12
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
a = -3
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16

Simplify:
\[
-10 - 6 = -16

\[
-16 = -16

Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[

Simplify:
\[
6 = 6
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the level of the water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the rate at which the height is rising. The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the tank is \( \pi r^2 \), so the volume added per hour can also be expressed as:

\[ \text{Volume added per hour} = \pi r^2 \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Given that \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour, we can substitute this into the equation:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin if \(a > 0\), or at \((0,0)\) if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(f(a) = a^3\).

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) is \(-\infty\), and as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, the value of \(f(x)\) is \(f(a^-) = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(f(a^-) = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is less than or equal to zero.

Since \(a\) must be positive for the function to be defined in the context of the problem, we consider the interval \([0, 2]\).

The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(a = 2\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) that makes the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of \( \frac{1}{2} \), we first need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \).

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0, \]
we complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

For the \( x \)-terms, \( x^2 - 10x \), we take half of \(-10\), which is \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25. \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25. \]

For the \( y \)-terms, \( y^2 + 6y \), we take half of \(6\), which is \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9. \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9. \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0. \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0. \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c. \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is \(\frac{1}{2}\), so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = \frac{1}{2}\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 34 - c = \frac{1}{4}. \]
Next, we isolate \( c \) by subtracting \(\frac{1}{4}\) from 34:
\[ 34 - \frac{1}{4} = c. \]
To perform the subtraction, convert 34 to a fraction with a denominator of 4:
\[ 34 = \frac{136}{4}. \]
So,
\[ c = \frac{136}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{135}{4}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(a\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(a) \neq a\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points.

A fixed point of \(f(x)\) is a solution to the equation \(f(x) = x\):

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ (\lambda - 1)x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x((\lambda - 1) - \lambda x) = 0. \]

So, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) must be either in the interval \((0, \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda})\) or \((\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}, 1)\).

Now, we need to check if there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

The function \(f(x)\) is a quadratic function, and its graph is a parabola opening downwards with its vertex at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The value of \(f(x)\) at the vertex is:

\[ f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}. \]

For \(f(x)\) to have a fixed point in the interval \((0,1)\), \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) must be in the interval \((0,1)\), i.e., \(0 < \frac{\lambda}{4} < 1\), which implies \(0 < \lambda < 4\).

Now, we need to check if there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This is possible if the parabola intersects the line \(y = x\) at two points, one of which is not a fixed point. This happens when the parabola is not tangent to the line \(y = x\) at any point other than the fixed points.

The condition for the parabola to intersect the line \(y = x\) at two points is that the discriminant of the equation \(f(x) = x\) must be positive. The discriminant of the quadratic equation \((\lambda - 1)x - \lambda x^2 = 0\) is:

\[ (\lambda - 1)^2 - 4(-\lambda)(0) = (\lambda - 1)^2. \]

For the parabola to intersect the line \(y = x\) at two points, \((\lambda - 1)^2 > 0\), which implies \(\lambda \neq 1\).

"To find the value of the angle \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The given equation is:

\]

We can group the terms in the numerator and the denominator to use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:

\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the sine addition formula \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:

\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first need to identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E. Here, the letter E appears twice, and the other letters (L, I, P, S) each appear once.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters L, I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{2!}
\]

Next, we calculate \( 7! \) and \( 2! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]
\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 2 \):

\[
\frac{5040}{2} = 2520
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is \(\boxed{2520}\).","[2520, '2520']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",False
"To determine the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior at the boundary points and critical points.

First, let's consider the boundary points. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0, \]
\[ f(-1, y) = y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
Similarly, if either \( y = 1 \) or \( y = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \), so the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0, \]
\[ f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
Thus, the function is zero at all the boundary points.

Next, we need to find the critical points inside the interval \( -1 < x, y < 1 \). To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}. \]
Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}, \]
\[ \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}. \]
From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[ \sqrt{(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2)} = xy, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 = x^2, \]
\[ y^2 = 1 - x^2, \]
\[ y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
From the second equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[ \sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} = xy, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 = y^2, \]
\[ x^2 = 1 - y^2, \]
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{1 - y^2}. \]
Since \( y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and \( x = \pm \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), we can choose \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). Substituting \( y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), we get:
\[ x = \sqrt{1 - (\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2} = \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} = \sqrt{x^2} = x. \]
This is consistent, so we can choose \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Substituting these values into the function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we start by using the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area of the triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by half the magnitude of their cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[

\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
So, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]

we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies the equation \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we do not need the exact value of \( \theta \) to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Instead, we use the property of the golden ratio. The number \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, and it is known that the powers of the golden ratio modulo 1 are periodic. Specifically, the sequence \( \cos n\theta \) for \( \theta \) such that \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is periodic with a period of 12.

Since \( 85 \equiv 5 \pmod{12} \), we have

\[ \cos 85\theta = \cos 5\theta. \]

We know that

\[ \cos 5\theta = 16 \cos^5 \theta - 20 \cos^3 \theta + 5 \cos \theta. \]

Substituting \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we get

\[ \cos^2 \theta = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8}, \]

\[ \cos^3 \theta = \cos \theta \cdot \cos^2 \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(3 + \sqrt{5})}{32} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} + 3\sqrt{5} + 5}{32} = \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{5}}{32} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8}, \]

\[ \cos^5 \theta = \cos \theta \cdot \cos^4 \theta = \cos \theta \cdot (1 - 2\cos^2 \theta + \cos^4 \theta) = \cos \theta \cdot (1 - 2 \cdot \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8} + \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8}) = \cos \theta \cdot (1 - \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{8}) = \cos \theta \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(5 - \sqrt{5})}{32} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{5} + 5\sqrt{5} - 5}{32} = \frac{4\sqrt{5}}{32} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{8}. \]

Substituting these values into the expression for \( \cos 5\theta \), we get

\[ \cos 5\theta = 16 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{8} - 20 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} + 5 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{20 + 20\sqrt{5}}{8} + \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{10 + 10\sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = 2\sqrt{5} - \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{8\sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{5 + 5\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3\sqrt{5} - 5}{4}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and the fact that the line parallel to \(BC\) through the centroid \(G\) divides the triangle \(ABC\) into two regions of equal area.

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle \(ABC\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Now, consider the line through \(G\) that is parallel to \(BC\). This line intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the centroid to the base, which is \(2:3\).

Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[

Therefore, the area of triangle \(ABC\) is divided into two regions of equal area by the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\), and the area of triangle \(ABC\) is:

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:

Now, we distribute the 10:

- 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13 are odd.

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In this case, since there is only one even number (2) among the first six prime numbers, the only way to get an even sum is if both Bول and Giousi choose odd numbers.

There are 5 odd numbers among the first six prime numbers. The probability that Bول chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Giousi chooses an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Bول and Giousi choose odd numbers is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Bول and Giousi is even is \(\boxed{\frac{25}{36}}\).","[25/36, '\\frac{25}{36}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To determine the value of \( b \) when the point \( (a, b) \) lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \) and \( a = 4 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( x = a \) and \( y = b \) into the equation of the line. Since \( a = 4 \), we substitute \( x = 4 \) and \( y = b \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \).
2. Simplify the equation to solve for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

To isolate \( 2b \), we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Now, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]
\[ b = 0 \]

"To determine the total area of the region that is shaded, we need to calculate the area of each shaded portion and then sum these areas.

1. **Identify the areas of the shaded portions:**
   - The first shaded portion is a square with side length 2. The area of a square is given by the formula \( \text{side length}^2 \). Therefore, the area of the first shaded portion is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4

   - The second shaded portion is a rectangle with a length of 3 and a width of 4, but a smaller square with a side length of 2 is cut out from one of its corners. The area of the rectangle is:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12
     \]
     The area of the smaller square that is cut out is:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4

     Therefore, the area of the second shaded portion is:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8

2. **Sum the areas of the shaded portions:**
   - The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the first and second shaded portions:

Thus, the total area of the region that is shaded is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",10,"[10, '10']",False
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros except for a single digit 1, we need to consider the properties of the number 450 and its multiples.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include all the prime factors of 450 in its factorization. Therefore, the number must end in at least two zeros (because of the \(5^2\)) and must be divisible by 2 and 9.

To ensure that the number has all digits as zeros except for a single digit 1, the number must be of the form \(1000\ldots0\). This number must be divisible by 450. Since it must end in two zeros, it is already divisible by \(10^2 = 100\). We only need to check if it is divisible by 45.

A number is divisible by 45 if it is divisible by both 5 and 9. We already know it is divisible by 5 because it ends in two zeros. Now, we need to check if it is divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. For the number \(1000\ldots0\), the sum of the digits is 1. Since 1 is not divisible by 9, the number \(1000\ldots0\) is not divisible by 9.

Therefore, the number \(1000\ldots0\) is not divisible by 45. We need to find the next number of the form \(1000\ldots0\) that is divisible by 45. This number must be of the form \(10^k\) where \(k\) is such that \(10^k\) is divisible by 45. However, \(10^k\) will always end in two zeros, so it will always be divisible by 100. We need to find the smallest \(k\) such that \(10^k\) is divisible by 45.

Since \(10^k\) will always end in two zeros, it will always be divisible by 100. We need to find the smallest \(k\) such that \(10^k\) is divisible by 45. This number must be of the form \(10^k\) where \(k\) is such that \(10^k\) is divisible by 45. However, \(10^k\) will always end in two zeros, so it will always be divisible by 100.

"To determine the probability that the pointer lands on a square that is painted gray, we need to analyze the process of determining the gray squares on the 6x6 grid. The grid is divided into 18 gray squares, which can be identified by the intersections of certain rows and columns.

First, let's identify the gray squares:
- The gray squares are in the following positions:
  - (1,1)
  - (1,2)
  - (1,6)
  - (2,1)
  - (2,2)
  - (2,6)
  - (3,1)
  - (3,2)
  - (3,6)
  - (4,1)
  - (4,2)
  - (4,6)
  - (5,1)
  - (5,2)
  - (5,6)
  - (6,1)
  - (6,2)
  - (6,6)

There are 18 gray squares in total.

Next, we need to determine the probability that the pointer lands on one of these gray squares. The pointer is determined by the first two digits of the randomly chosen numbers, where the first digit is the remainder when the first number is divided by 4, and the second digit is the remainder when the second number is divided by 5.

The possible values for the first digit are 1, 2, 3, and the possible values for the second digit are 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) possible outcomes for the first two digits.

Since there are 18 gray squares out of a total of 36 squares on the grid, the probability that the pointer lands on a gray square is the ratio of the number of gray squares to the total number of squares. However, we need to consider that the pointer is determined by the first two digits, which means we need to count the number of gray squares that correspond to these outcomes.

The gray squares that correspond to the first two digits are:
- (1,1)
- (1,2)
- (1,6)
- (2,1)
- (2,2)
- (2,6)
- (3,1)
- (3,2)

- (4,2)
- (4,6)
- (5,1)
- (5,2)
- (5,6)
- (6,1)
- (6,2)
- (6,6)

There are 18 gray squares in total, and each gray square corresponds to a unique pair of remainders when the first number is divided by 4 and the second number is divided by 5. Therefore, the probability that the pointer lands on a gray square is:
\[
\frac{18}{36} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Thus, the probability that the pointer lands on a square that is painted gray is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

First, let's calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}\]

Now, let's convert this fraction to a decimal:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605\]

Next, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5. Note that the leading zeros after the decimal point do not contribute to the sum.

So, the sum of the digits is:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) and is the smallest possible angle is:
\[
\theta = 30^\circ.

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:

\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.

\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-x) = -\sin x\), we have \(\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \cdot \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{3 \tan^2 40^\circ}{4 \cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

However, we can use a known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
3 + 9 = 12.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles except one:**
   If the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the sum of all interior angles is \(1070^\circ + x\), where \(x\) is the measure of the missing angle.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all interior angles is also \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   However, since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all interior angles \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\) must be slightly more than \(1070^\circ\).

4. **Find the range for \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the value of \(n\) such that:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ > 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   n-2 > \frac{1070}{180}
   \]
   \[
   n-2 > 5.9444
   \]
   \[
   n > 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the missing angle \(x\) is:
   \[
   x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(x = 10^\circ\) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, our solution is correct.

Therefore, the number of sides in the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the multiplicative inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:

\[
t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution. Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting this back into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
t = -1 \pm 5 \pmod{23}

This gives us two possible solutions:

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \pmod{23}

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

   The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:

   where \(s\) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we have:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). The product of a number and its conjugate can be found using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Calculating the squares, we have:

"To find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:

So, the \(n\)-th term of the sequence of odd numbers is \(2n - 1\). To find the 2003rd term, we substitute \(n = 2003\) into the formula:

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Now, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

Setting this equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

   - The bottom boundary is \(y = -4\).
   - The top boundary is \(y = 4\).

2. **Determine the range of integer \(x\) and \(y\) values:**

\[

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

First, let's denote the angles and the sides of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Let \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BAD = 2\theta\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Let \(AB = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), and \(AD = d\). The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\).

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot BC \cdot \sin \angle ABC

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[

\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem in \(\triangle ABD\):
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]
However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of \(\triangle ABC\) because \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\) and \(\overline{AC}\) is the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\) in \(\triangle ACD\).

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[

Therefore, the total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:

\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation and check if it holds true. The left side of the original equation becomes:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is:

\[
\boxed{\frac{9}{19}}

"To find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation \( @ \). According to the definition, \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\). Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

To simplify this, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = \frac{70 \times 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To determine the probability that two randomly chosen chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) in a circle intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of chords in a circle.

First, let's understand the condition under which two chords intersect. Two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the endpoints of one chord lie on opposite sides of the other chord. In other words, if we traverse the circle starting from point \(A\) and moving clockwise, the next point \(B\) will be followed by a point \(C\) on the opposite side of the circle, and then a point \(D\) on the opposite side of \(C\), or vice versa.

To analyze this, we can use the concept of the order in which the points are chosen. If we label the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) in a clockwise order around the circle, the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle, i.e., \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these).

The total number of ways to arrange 4 points in a circle is \((4-1)! = 3!\) because one point can be fixed to break the rotational symmetry. Therefore, there are \(3! = 6\) possible arrangements of the points.

Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords intersecting (the alternating patterns mentioned above). Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the overlapping region of two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. The centers of the circles are both \(D\), and the radii of the circles are \(1\) and \(2\).

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is \(2\), so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the overlapping region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, so it is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to find the area of the overlapping region of the two circles. The overlapping region consists of two segments of the circles. The area of a segment of a circle is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points of intersection.

Let's denote the points of intersection of the two circles by \(A\) and \(B\). The triangle \(DAB\) is a triangle with sides \(DA = 1\), \(DB = 2\), and \(AB\). We need to find the length of \(AB\).

The area of the overlapping region can be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two segments. The area of a segment of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

For the smaller circle with radius \(1\), the area of the segment is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1)
\]
For the larger circle with radius \(2\), the area of the segment is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2) = 2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2)
\]

The total area of the overlapping region is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (\theta_1 - \sin \theta_1) + 2 (\theta_2 - \sin \theta_2) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Since the angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle subtended by the chord \(AB\) at the center \(D\), it is the sum of the central angles \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\). We need to find \(\theta_1\) and \(\theta_2\) such that the above equation holds.

By symmetry and geometric properties, we can deduce that the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(60^\circ\). This is because the configuration of the circles and the overlapping area suggests that the angle between the radii to the points of intersection is \(60^\circ\).

Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how much water is needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of the tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere.

First, we need to find the radius of the spherical tank. The problem states that the diameter of the tank is 6 cm. The radius is half of the diameter, so:

\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cm} \]

Now, we can substitute this radius into the volume formula:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, we need to find the volume of one conical flask. The problem states that the height \( h \) of the conical flask is 8 cm and the radius \( r \) of the base is half of the diameter of the conical flask. However, the diameter of the conical flask is not directly given, but we can use the information about the conical flask to find the volume. The problem does not provide the radius of the base of the conical flask, so we will assume that the conical flask is a standard conical flask with a radius equal to the radius of the spherical tank, which is 3 cm. Therefore, the volume \( V \) of one conical flask is:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (8) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9) (8) = 24 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many conical flasks are required to fill the spherical tank. We do this by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one conical flask:

\[ \text{Number of conical flasks} = \frac{36 \pi}{24 \pi} = \frac{36}{24} = 1.5 \]

Since we cannot have half a conical flask, we need to round up to the next whole number. Therefore, we need 2 conical flasks to fill the spherical tank.

The volume of water needed is the volume of 2 conical flasks:

\[ \text{Volume of water} = 2 \times 24 \pi = 48 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Using the approximation \( \pi \approx 3.14 \):

\[ \text{Volume of water} \approx 48 \times 3.14 = 150.72 \text{ cubic cm} \]

However, since the problem asks for the number of conical flasks, the final answer is:

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \frac{9}{100} = 0.09.

First, we can express the product of the three integers as:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we can express the average of the three integers as:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = 24.\]
Simplifying the numerator, we get:
\[\frac{3x + 3}{3} = 24.\]
This simplifies further to:

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \( 4096 = 64^2 \), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

Therefore, the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is:

\[
\boxed{66}

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.
\]
Therefore, the original expression is:
\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\left( -\frac{1}{16} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:

The sum of these 27 integers is:
\[

This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(x\), the last term \(x+26\), and 27 terms. The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[

1. \( y^2 + 4y > -4 \)
2. \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \)

**Step 1: Solve the inequality \( y^2 + 4y > -4 \).**

First, rewrite the inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0. \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0. \]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number and is always non-negative, with the only solution being \( y = -2 \). Therefore, the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) holds for all \( y \neq -2 \). Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we have \( y > -2 \) for all real \( x \). So, the solution to the first inequality is:
\[ y > -2. \]
Since \( y = x^2 \), this means:
\[ x^2 > -2, \]
which is true for all real \( x \). Therefore, the solution to the first inequality is all real \( x \).

**Step 2: Solve the inequality \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \).**

First, rewrite the inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0. \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0. \]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \( y = -7 \) and \( y = 3 \). The expression \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is:
\[ -7 < y < 3. \]
Since \( y = x^2 \), this means:
\[ -7 < x^2 < 3. \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Therefore, the solution to the original compound inequality is:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

In interval notation, the solution is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and substitutions.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12,\]
which expands to
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
Since \(xy + yz + zx = p\) and \(xyz = 4\), we can rewrite the equation as
\[sp - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We know that
\[x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12,\]
so the equation becomes
\[sp - (sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = 12,\]
which is true but does not provide new information.

Now we return to the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\). We need to find a consistent solution for \(s\) and \(p\). Let's test some possible values. If we try \(s = 2\), we get
\[-8 = 2(2^2 - 3p),\]

\[-8 = 2(4 - 3p),\]
or
\[-8 = 8 - 6p,\]
or

"To determine which grade has a higher percentage of students with red hair than students with brown hair, we need to compare the percentage of red hair students to the percentage of brown hair students in each grade. Specifically, we are looking for the grade where the percentage of red hair students is greater than 135% of the percentage of brown hair students.

Let's calculate this step by step for each grade:

1. **9th Grade:**
   - Percentage of red hair students: \(41.1\%\)
   - Percentage of brown hair students: \(39.4\%\)
   - Calculate \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students:
     \[
     1.35 \times 39.4 = 53.19\%
     \]
   - Compare \(41.1\%\) to \(53.19\%\):
     \[
     41.1\% < 53.19\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage of red hair students is not greater than \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students in 9th grade.

2. **10th Grade:**
   - Percentage of red hair students: \(34.4\%\)
   - Percentage of brown hair students: \(33.1\%\)
   - Calculate \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students:
     \[
     1.35 \times 33.1 = 44.685\%
     \]
   - Compare \(34.4\%\) to \(44.685\%\):
     \[
     34.4\% < 44.685\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage of red hair students is not greater than \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students in 10th grade.

3. **11th Grade:**
   - Percentage of red hair students: \(20.6\%\)
   - Percentage of brown hair students: \(13.8\%\)
   - Calculate \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students:
     \[
     1.35 \times 13.8 = 18.63\%
     \]
   - Compare \(20.6\%\) to \(18.63\%\):
     \[
     20.6\% > 18.63\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage of red hair students is greater than \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students in 11th grade.

4. **12th Grade:**
   - Percentage of red hair students: \(11.6\%\)
   - Percentage of brown hair students: \(8.6\%\)
   - Calculate \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students:
     \[
     1.35 \times 8.6 = 11.61\%
     \]
   - Compare \(11.6\%\) to \(11.61\%\):
     \[
     11.6\% < 11.61\%
     \]
   - Therefore, the percentage of red hair students is not greater than \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students in 12th grade.

From the above calculations, we see that the only grade where the percentage of red hair students is greater than \(135\%\) of the percentage of brown hair students is the 11th grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality will change signs at \(x = 9\), \(x = -9\), and \(x = 0\), \(x = 36\).

Next, we need to determine the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\). Then,
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   So, the expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined, which means these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

In interval notation, the solution is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular prism, we need to analyze the given information and the diagram. The diagram shows a rectangular prism with a circular base, and the total length of the rectangular prism (including the circumferences of the two semicircles) is 400 meters.

First, let's denote the dimensions of the rectangular prism:
- Let \( l \) be the length of the rectangular prism.
- Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangular prism.
- Let \( h \) be the height of the rectangular prism, which is also the diameter of the semicircles.

Since the semicircles are part of the base of the rectangular prism, the width \( w \) of the rectangular prism is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is \( h \). Therefore, \( w = h \).

The total length of the rectangular prism is the sum of the length \( l \) and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle, so the circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi h \). Since there are two semicircles, the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi h \).

Thus, the total length of the rectangular prism is:
\[ l + \pi h = 400 \]

We want to maximize the volume \( V \) of the rectangular prism, which is given by:
\[ V = l \times w \times h = l \times h \times h = l \times h^2 \]

From the equation \( l + \pi h = 400 \), we can express \( l \) in terms of \( h \):
\[ l = 400 - \pi h \]

Substituting this into the volume formula, we get:
\[ V = (400 - \pi h) h^2 = 400h^2 - \pi h^3 \]

To find the value of \( h \) that maximizes the volume, we take the derivative of \( V \) with respect to \( h \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = 800h - 3\pi h^2 \]
\[ 800h - 3\pi h^2 = 0 \]
\[ h(800 - 3\pi h) = 0 \]

This gives us two solutions: \( h = 0 \) (which is not practical) and \( h = \frac{800}{3\pi} \).

We use \( h = \frac{800}{3\pi} \) to find the corresponding value of \( l \):
\[ l = 400 - \pi \left( \frac{800}{3\pi} \right) = 400 - \frac{800}{3} = \frac{1200}{3} - \frac{800}{3} = \frac{400}{3} \]

Now, we can find the volume \( V \):
\[ V = l \times h^2 = \frac{400}{3} \times \left( \frac{800}{3\pi} \right)^2 = \frac{400}{3} \times \frac{640000}{9\pi^2} = \frac{400 \times 640000}{27\pi^2} = \frac{256000000}{27\pi^2} \]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the rectangular prism is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that \(RT = 5\), we can find \(RS\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
RS = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values of \(RT\) and \(RS\):

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:

"To find the smallest distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) as:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}

Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:

d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To minimize \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[

The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Substituting \(x = \sqrt{2}\) (or \(x = -\sqrt{2}\)) back into the distance formula, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

Thus, the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\). Here, \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\), so \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\). Therefore, the answer is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0

   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):

   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( B \) of the regular octahedron, we start by analyzing the given distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same. Let's denote the vertices as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, \( B \) and \( E \) are opposite, and \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite.

We are given the distances:
\[ PA = 3, \quad PB = 7, \quad PC = 8, \quad PD = 9, \quad PE = 11. \]

Since \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, \( B \) and \( E \) are opposite, and \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite, the distance between \( A \) and \( F \) is the same as the distance between \( B \) and \( E \), and the distance between \( C \) and \( D \). Let's denote this common distance by \( d \).

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus three times the square of the distance from the point to the center. Since the center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is \( 6 \left( \frac{d}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2 = 6 \cdot \frac{d^2}{2} = 3d^2 \).

Let \( O \) be the center of the octahedron. Then the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 3d^2 + 3PO^2. \]

We know \( PA^2 = 9 \), \( PB^2 = 49 \), \( PC^2 = 64 \), \( PD^2 = 81 \), and \( PE^2 = 121 \). Let \( PF^2 = x \). Then:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x = 3d^2 + 3PO^2. \]

Since \( 3d^2 + 3PO^2 \) is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is also equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices plus three times the square of the distance from \( P \) to the center. Therefore, we can find \( x \) by:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x = 3d^2 + 3PO^2. \]

However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices plus three times the square of the distance from \( P \) to the center. Therefore, we can find \( x \) by:

In this problem, the force applied to both the ball and the basketball is the same because they are being propelled by the same source of power. Let's denote this force by \( F \).

To find the ratio of the accelerations, we solve for \( \frac{a_b}{a_{bb}} \):

\[ \frac{a_b}{a_{bb}} = \frac{m_{bb}}{m_b} \]

Substituting the given masses, we get:

\[ \frac{a_b}{a_{bb}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the ball to the acceleration of the basketball is:

"To determine the number of similar digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits in the same positions:

- The first digit (from the right) is 6 in base 7 and 5 in base 8. They are different.
- The second digit is 5 in base 7 and 6 in base 8. They are different.
- The third digit is 5 in base 7 and 1 in base 8. They are different.
- The fourth digit is 1 in base 7 and 1 in base 8. They are the same.

There is only one digit that is the same in both representations.

Thus, the number of similar digits is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To determine the number of migrations that occurred in the bowl, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. There are 1000 sاحرات and 10 sحratees in the bowl.
2. Each sحratee wants to be the only sاحratee in the bowl, so each sحratee will take one sاحrate.
3. Since there are 10 sحratees and 1000 sاحرات, each sحratee will take one sاحrate, and there will be 990 sاحرات left over.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):
\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2.

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:

\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

We can use the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) - \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This identity can be rewritten as:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

"To determine the price of the pencil case, we need to set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( p \) be the price of one pencil.
- Let \( c \) be the price of one pencil case.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. Three pencils and one pencil case cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3p + c = 1.24
   \]

2. Five pencils and one pencil case cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + c = 1.82
   \]

We can eliminate \( c \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + c) - (3p + c) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
\[
2p = 0.58
\]
\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2}

\[
p = 0.29

So, the price of one pencil is \$0.29. Now, we can substitute \( p = 0.29 \) back into the first equation to find \( c \):
\[

\]
\[
0.87 + c = 1.24

The decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). This decimal is terminating, meaning it does not repeat and it has three digits after the decimal point.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\), so \(a = k \cdot b\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if it lies inside the circle centered at \(O\) with radius equal to the distance from \(O\) to the nearest vertex. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore, the point \((x, y)\) must satisfy:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < a^2 + b^2
\]

This inequality describes a circle centered at the origin with radius \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). The area of this circle is:
\[

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is \( \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is \( \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money remains after buying the items and converting the remaining amount to the nearest dollar, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the items.
2. Subtract the total cost from the total amount of money received.
3. Round the remaining amount to the nearest dollar.

First, let's find the total cost of the items:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59

So, the total cost of the items is $126.59.

Next, we subtract the total cost from the total amount of money received. The total amount of money received is the sum of the amounts each person received:
\[
\text{Total amount received} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52

We already calculated this sum as $126.59. Therefore, the remaining amount after buying the items is:
\[
\text{Remaining amount} = 126.59 - 126.59 = 0

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is 15.

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 3n + 1
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n + 1 = 15
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n = 14 \implies n = \frac{14}{3}
\]
This is not an integer, so let's recheck the calculations.

Finally, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 15
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n = 21 \implies n = 7
\]

Finally, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
2n + 1 = 15
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n = 14 \implies n = 7
\]

Finally, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
4n - 13 = 15
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
4n = 28 \implies n = 7
\]

Finally, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 3n - 6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 15
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n = 21 \implies n = 7
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15 when \( n = 7 \), the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer feet the fisher caught than the marlin, we need to calculate the distance each fisher traveled and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance the fisher caught traveled. The fisher caught the marlin by swimming directly across the rectangular pool. The width of the pool is 300 feet, so the fisher traveled a distance of 300 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance the marlin traveled. The marlin swam directly to the opposite side of the pool, which means it traveled the length of the pool. The length of the pool is 400 feet, so the marlin traveled a distance of 400 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance traveled by the marlin and the distance traveled by the fisher:
\[ 400 \text{ feet} - 300 \text{ feet} = 100 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the fisher caught \(\boxed{100}\) fewer feet than the marlin.","[100, '100']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that visits all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to consider all possible permutations of the points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The points and their distances are given as follows:

- \(D\) to \(B = 3\)
- \(A\) to \(B = 6\)
- \(A\) to \(C = 6\)
- \(D\) to \(C = 4\)
- \(A\) to \(D = 5\)
- \(C\) to \(B = 5\)

We will evaluate the distances for the following permutations of the points: \(A \to B \to C \to D\) and \(A \to B \to D \to C\), since these are the only two possible paths that visit all points exactly once.

**Permutation 1: \(A \to B \to C \to D\)**

The total distance is:
\[AB + BC + CD\]

We need to find \(BC\). From the given distances, we know:
\[C \to B = 5\]

So, the total distance is:
\[6 + 5 + 4 = 15\]

**Permutation 2: \(A \to B \to D \to C\)**

The total distance is:
\[AB + BD + DC\]

We need to find \(BD\). From the given distances, we know:
\[A \to D = 5\]

So, the total distance is:
\[6 + 5 + 4 = 15\]

Both permutations give the same total distance of 15. Therefore, the shortest path that visits all four points exactly once is:
