"To determine the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the distance \(EF\) is simply the difference in their y-coordinates, which is \(7 - 0 = 7\) units. This confirms that the y-coordinate of \(E\) is correct.

Next, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\), we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of different ways 8 people can form a circle, we need to consider that in a circular arrangement, one person's position is fixed to account for rotational symmetry. This means that the arrangement of the remaining 7 people will determine the distinct configurations.

Here are the steps to find the number of different circular arrangements:

1. Fix one person in one position. This person's position is arbitrary and does not affect the distinctness of the arrangement.
2. Arrange the remaining 7 people in the remaining 7 positions. The number of ways to arrange 7 people in a line is given by the factorial of 7, denoted as \(7!\).

The factorial of 7 is calculated as follows:
\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3.

So,
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To determine how many degrees a regular pentagon will rotate around its center when it is flipped upside down, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of sides of the pentagon:**
   A regular pentagon has 5 sides.

2. **Calculate the central angle of the pentagon:**
   The central angle of a regular polygon is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{n}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   \text{Central angle} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
   \]

3. **Determine the rotation when the pentagon is flipped upside down:**
   When a regular pentagon is flipped upside down, it will rotate by twice the central angle. This is because flipping the pentagon upside down is equivalent to rotating it by 180 degrees, which is twice the central angle:
   \[
   \text{Rotation} = 2 \times 72^\circ = 144^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the regular pentagon will rotate \(\boxed{144}\) degrees around its center when it is flipped upside down.","[144, '144']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \((6, \frac{7}{2})\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied by \(x = 6\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) is not necessarily the one that makes \(x > 7\). However, the problem specifically asks for the value of \(x + y\) under the condition \(x > 7\), which is not possible with the given vertices and the property of the diagonals bisecting each other.

Given the problem constraints and the correct interpretation, the correct value of \(x + y\) is:

"To find \(\tan A\) given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) in a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

Given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute \(2 \cos A\) for \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

\[
\tan A = \frac{2 \cos A}{\cos A}

"To find the dikey asimptotları, yatay asimptotu, ve their sum for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the dikey asimptotları:**
   The dikey asimptotları occur where the denominator is zero, as these are the values of \( x \) that make the function undefined.

   The denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   We can factorize the quadratic expression:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the dikey asimptotları are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the yatay asimptotu:**
   The yatay asimptotu occurs as \( x \) approaches infinity or negative infinity. To find it, we look at the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

   The degree of the numerator is 1, and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the yatay asimptotu is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break it down into simpler steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):
\[
99^2 = 99 \times 99

To find \(99 \times 99\), we can use the formula for the square of a binomial \((a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2\), where \(a = 100\) and \(b = 1\):
\[
99^2 = (100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801

Now, we add \(99\) and \(1\) to \(9801\):
\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1 = 9901

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{9901}\).","[9901, '9901']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",True
"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm (or induced norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

In this problem, the exponent \(2^{235423523}\) is a very large number, but it is not zero. Therefore, we can apply the property of exponentiation that states any non-zero number raised to any power is still 1.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.

Thus, we have:

"To solve the subtraction problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we first need to convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10, perform the subtraction in base 10, and then convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10
The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53\]
So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17\]
So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9
To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), so \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\).

Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the weights of the objects involved:
- Let the weight of one squig be \( S \).
- Let the weight of one goolee be \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Three squigs and one goolee together weigh as much as three squigs.
2. Two squigs and one goolee together weigh as much as one squig.

We can express these pieces of information as equations:
1. \( 3S + G = 3S \)
2. \( 2S + G = S \)

Let's solve the first equation:
\[ 3S + G = 3S \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ G = 0 \]

So, the weight of one goolee is 0. Now, let's substitute \( G = 0 \) into the second equation:
\[ 2S + 0 = S \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2S = S \]
Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ S = 0 \]

So, the weight of one squig is also 0. Since both the squig and the goolee weigh 0, any number of squigs will also weigh 0. Therefore, any number of squigs will have the same total weight as one squig.

The problem asks how many squigs' total weight is equal to one squig's weight. Since any number of squigs will have the same total weight as one squig, the answer is any number. However, the problem is asking for a specific number, and the most logical interpretation is that the number of squigs is 1.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

Next, we combine like terms:
\[

We know that this expression must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms:
\[
12 = 12

\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8

\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6

From the first equation, we see that it is true. From the fifth equation, we can solve for \(a\):
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3

3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the third equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
The equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the fourth equation to verify:

"To determine the radius of the base of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the volume of the tank and the rate at which the volume is changing. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know that the volume is decreasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per second, and the height is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per second. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = -20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

We need to find the radius \( r \) when the height \( h \) is such that the volume is decreasing at the given rate. To do this, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} + 2\pi r h \frac{dr}{dt} \]

Since the radius \( r \) is constant, \( \frac{dr}{dt} = 0 \). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:

\[ -20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ -20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = -\frac{20}{4} = -5 \]

Since \( r^2 \) cannot be negative, we must have made an error in the interpretation of the problem. The correct interpretation is that the radius is constant, and the height is increasing, so the volume is decreasing due to the decrease in height. Therefore, the correct equation is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = -\pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into the equation, we get:

\[ -20\pi = -\pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel out \( -\pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) has at least one vertical asymptote, we need to analyze the function and its behavior at the boundary \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

A vertical asymptote occurs where the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as \(x\) approaches a certain value. In this case, we need to check the behavior of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from both the left and the right.

1. **Behavior as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the right:**
   When \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the right, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). This is a finite value, so there is no vertical asymptote from the right.

2. **Behavior as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left:**
   When \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). This is also a finite value, so there is no vertical asymptote from the left.

Since the function \(f(x)\) does not approach infinity or negative infinity as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from either side, there is no vertical asymptote at \(x = a\). However, the problem asks for the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(f(x)\) has at least one vertical asymptote. This implies that there must be a point where the function is undefined or has a discontinuity that causes a vertical asymptote.

The only way to introduce a vertical asymptote is if the function is undefined at \(x = a\). This can happen if the function is defined piecewise with a different expression at \(x = a\), but the given function does not have such a definition. Therefore, the problem must be interpreted as asking for the largest value of \(a\) such that the function has a discontinuity that causes a vertical asymptote, which is not possible with the given function.

However, if we interpret the problem as asking for the largest value of \(a\) such that the function has a discontinuity that causes a vertical asymptote in a different context (e.g., if the function were defined piecewise with a different expression at \(x = a\)), the largest value of \(a\) would be \(\boxed{0}\). This is because if \(a = 0\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which is continuous and does not have a vertical asymptote. Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) that does not introduce a vertical asymptote is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the given equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the right side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve for the value of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) for some \(x \in [0,1]\), we start by expressing \(f(f(x))\) in terms of \(x\).

First, let's find \(f(x)\):
\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

Next, we need to find \(f(f(x))\):
\[ f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We are given that \(f(f(x)) = x\), so we have:
\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ 1 - \lambda x(1 - x) = 1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2. \]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[ \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x. \]

We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:
\[ x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0. \]

This equation gives us two possible solutions: \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). Since we are looking for a solution where \(f(x) \neq x\), we discard \(x = 0\) and focus on the second equation:
\[ \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1. \]

To find a non-trivial solution, we can test some values of \(x\) that might simplify the equation. Let's try \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[ \lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \lambda \frac{1}{2} + \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right) = 1. \]
\[ \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{2} + \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = 1. \]
\[ \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = 1. \]
\[ \frac{\lambda^2}{2} \left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{4}\right) = 1. \]
\[ \frac{\lambda^2}{2} - \frac{\lambda^3}{8} = 1. \]
\[ 4\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 = 8. \]
\[ \lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0. \]

We need to find the roots of the polynomial \(\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 8\). Testing these values, we find:
\[ \lambda = 2 \implies 2^3 - 4 \cdot 2^2 + 8 = 8 - 16 + 8 = 0. \]

So, \(\lambda = 2\) is a root. We can factor \(\lambda^3 - 4\lambda^2 + 8\) as \((\lambda - 2)(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4)\). The quadratic \(\lambda^2 - 2\lambda - 4\) has no real roots because its discriminant is \((-2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4) = 4 + 16 = 20\), which is positive, and the roots are \(\lambda = 1 \pm \sqrt{5}\), both of which are greater than 2. Therefore, the only real root in the interval \([0, 4]\) is \(\lambda = 2\).

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression. The given expression is:

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

- \( n_1 = 2 \) (for E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for L)
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for P)
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for S)
- \( n_5 = 1 \) (for S)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

We can express \( z \) in exponential form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, the given equation becomes:
\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \alpha. \]
Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the centroid to the sides. Specifically, since \(AG:AD = 2:3\) (where \(D\) is the midpoint of \(BC\)), the ratio of the sides of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64
\]

Since \(MN \parallel BC\), the area of triangle \(MNC\) is the remaining part of triangle \(ABC\) after removing triangle \(AMN\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(MNC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle MNC = 144 - 64 = 80
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \(MNC\) is \(\boxed{80}\).","[80, '80']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To determine which of the three remaining kitsaplar matematik kitabıdır, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of kitsaplar alınıyor.
2. Determine the number of kitsaplar alınıyor en az bir rafta.
3. Calculate the number of matematik kitaplar alınıyor en az bir rafta.

First, we know that each of the three rafts has 2 kitsaplar alınıyor. Therefore, the total number of kitsaplar alınıyor is:
\[ 3 \times 2 = 6 \]

Next, we need to determine how many kitsaplar en az bir rafta alınıyor. The upper raft has 8 gizem kitapları, the middle raft has 10 matematik kitapları, and the lower raft has 6 bilim kitapları. Since the middle raft has the most kitsaplar, the lower raft has the second most, and the upper raft has the least, the lower raft will have the most kitsaplar alınıyor. Therefore, the lower raft will have 2 kitsaplar alınıyor.

Now, we need to calculate the number of matematik kitaplar alınıyor en az bir rafta. Since the middle raft has 10 matematik kitapları and the lower raft has 6 matematik kitapları, the lower raft will have the most matematik kitaplar alınıyor. Therefore, the lower raft will have 2 matematik kitaplar alınıyor.

Since the lower raft is the only raft that has 2 kitsaplar alınıyor and 2 of them are matematik kitaplar, the three remaining kitsaplar are all from the lower raft. Therefore, the three remaining kitsaplar include 2 matematik kitaplar and 1 bilim kitap.

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence, which is given by:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general form of the \(n\)-th term, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general form of the \(n\)-th term:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit numbers are divisible by both 100 and 150, we first need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

The prime factorizations of 100 and 150 are:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

This means that \( 2^{24} = k^n \), which implies that \( k \) must be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \). Then we have:

\[

By equating the exponents, we get:

We need to find all pairs \((m, n)\) of positive integers such that \( mn = 24 \) and \( n > 1 \). First, we list the factors of 24:

1. Identify the value of each type of bill.
2. Determine the total value of all the bills.
3. Calculate the number of five-dollar bills based on the total value.

Step 1: Identify the value of each type of bill.
- The value of a one-dollar bill is $1.
- The value of a five-dollar bill is $5.

Step 2: Determine the total value of all the bills.
- Hillary has one one-dollar bill and five five-dollar bills.
- The value of the one-dollar bill is $1.
- The value of the five five-dollar bills is \(5 \times 5 = 25\) dollars.

- The value of the five-dollar bills is \(75 - 1 = 74\) dollars.
- The number of five-dollar bills is \(\frac{74}{5} = 14.8\).

Since the number of five-dollar bills must be a whole number, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The problem states that the total value of the bills is $75, but the problem also states that the total value of the bills is $26. There seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the first six randomly selected prime numbers is even, we need to consider the properties of prime numbers and their sums. Specifically, we need to know whether the sum of an even number of odd numbers is even or odd.

First, let's list the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13. Among these, there is only one even prime number, which is 2. The rest of the prime numbers are odd.

The sum of an even number of odd numbers is even. Therefore, if we select any five of the five odd prime numbers and add the even prime number 2, the sum will be even. If we select any other combination of six prime numbers, the sum will be odd because the sum of an odd number of odd numbers is odd.

Since there is only one even prime number, the only way to get an even sum is to include the even prime number 2 in the selection. The number of ways to choose the remaining five numbers from the five odd prime numbers is \( \binom{5}{5} = 1 \).

The total number of ways to choose any six prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is \( \binom{6}{6} = 1 \).

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the first six randomly selected prime numbers is even is:

   - Since the total number of columns is not specified, we assume it is a multiple of 4. Let's denote the total number of columns by \( C \). Therefore, the first number selected is one of \( \left\{ \frac{C}{4}, \frac{C}{4} + 1, \frac{C}{4} + 2, \frac{C}{4} + 3 \right\} \).

   - The first number can be any of 1, 2, or 3, and the second number can be any of 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The probability that the first number is the same as the second number is the probability that the first number is 1, 2, or 3 and the second number is also 1, 2, or 3. Since the second number can be 1, 2, 3, or 4, the probability that the second number is 1, 2, or 3 is \( \frac{3}{4} \).

Given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we first calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \) and its roots. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function to the left by \( c \) units corresponds to replacing \( x \) with \( x + c \) in the function. In this case, \( c = 5 \), so \( g(x) = f(x+5) \).

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:

\[ (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.

Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
3 + 12 = 15.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

where \(n\) is the number of sides of the polygon. We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division on the right side:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

So, we have:

\[
n-2 \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\) to the nearest whole number, which is \(6\). Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( (t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we rewrite the congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
This can be rearranged to:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]
We need to solve this quadratic congruence. The quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) can be used, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]
We need to find the integer solutions modulo 23. First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{2} \) exists modulo 23. We need to check if there is an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \).

We test the integers from 1 to 11 (since \( -x \) will give the same result as \( x \) modulo 23):
\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
\]
Thus, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since we are asked for the unique solution, we need to check which one satisfies the original condition. Both 4 and 17 satisfy the condition, but the problem asks for the unique solution, which implies there is only one solution in the given range.

"To find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). The product of a number and its conjugate can be found using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\), so \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
d = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can use \(\mathbf{d}_1\) as the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\).

Let \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

First, let's consider the range for \(x\). The \(x\)-coordinates must be greater than \(-5\) and less than \(5\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible values for \(x\).

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

Combining these results, we have

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

- Brazil: 12 stamps at $6 each
- France: 12 stamps at $4 each
- Peru: 9 stamps at $4 each
- Spain: 13 stamps at $10 each

Next, we calculate the total price for each country:

- Total price for France: \(12 \times 4 = 48\) dollars
- Total price for Peru: \(9 \times 4 = 36\) dollars

Since we need to round this to the nearest tenth, we look at the digit in the hundredths place, which is 1. Since 1 is less than 5, we round down. Therefore, the average price per stamp is approximately 6.2 dollars.

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b)
\]

We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b) = 42 \implies d \times (a + b) = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

To find \(a \times d\), we use the fact that \(d \times (a + b) = 84\). However, we need to express \(a\) in terms of \(d\) and \(b\). From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{BC} = \frac{a}{c} = \frac{a}{b - a}
\]

Since \(c = b - a\), we can substitute \(c\) in the equation:
\[
\frac{a}{b - a} = \frac{a}{b - a}
\]

This equation is true, but it doesn't provide new information. Instead, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid.

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified. Therefore, the solution to the equation is:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given definition of the operation \( @ \). The definition states that \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\).

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:
\[

To simplify this, we multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\):
\[

"To determine the probability that the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the points on a circle and the conditions under which two chords intersect.

First, let's label the points on the circle as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a clockwise order. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). However, since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining three points relative to it. This leaves us with \(3!\) (6) permutations of \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

Out of these 6 permutations, only 2 will result in the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the permutations where the points appear in an alternating pattern. Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in the given configuration of two circles with centers \(D\), radii 1 and 2, and a shaded region that is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region is a segment of the larger circle. The area of a segment of a circle is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord. Let \(\theta\) be the central angle of the sector in radians. The area of the sector is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Thus, the area of the segment is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment} = 2\theta - 2 \sin \theta
\]
We know this area is equal to the area of the shaded region:
\[
2\theta - 2 \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}

"To determine how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the spherical tank and the cylindrical containers, and then find the ratio of the spherical tank's volume to the cylindrical container's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. The diameter of the spherical tank is 12 cm (since the radius is 6 cm), so the radius is 6 cm. Substituting the radius into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The radius of the cylindrical container is 1.5 cm (since the diameter is 3 cm), and the height is 8 cm. Substituting the radius and height into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (1.5)^2 (8) = \pi (2.25) (8) = 18 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical containers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{18 \pi} = \frac{288}{18} = 16 \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, let's denote:
\[
\alpha = \arcsin 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \beta = \arcsin 0.5.
\]
This means:
\[
\sin \alpha = 0.4 \quad \text{and} \quad \sin \beta = 0.5.
\]
We need to find:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha).
\]

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \alpha.
\]

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we can substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{2 \sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{21}}{10} = 0.
\]

Now, we can find the product:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot 0 = 0.

"Bisikletin hızı 20 feet/daya corresponds to a speed of 20 feet per day. To convert this speed into inches per second, we need to perform the following unit conversions:

1. Convert feet to inches: There are 12 inches in a foot.

"To determine the number of different ways to form a 5-member committee with at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible committees and then subtracting the number of committees that do not meet the criteria (i.e., committees that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee from the 14 members (8Cumhuriyetçi + 6 Demokrat). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a committee that is all from one party. There are two cases to consider: a committee all from the Cumhuriyetçi and a committee all from the Demokrat.

The number of ways to form a committee all from the Cumhuriyetçi is \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

The number of ways to form a committee all from the Demokrat is \( \binom{6}{5} \):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Add these two results together to get the total number of committees that are all from one party:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, subtract the number of committees that are all from one party from the total number of committees to get the number of committees with at least one member from each party:

\[

Thus, the number of different ways to form a 5-member committee with at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the sum of these three integers:
\[x + (x+1) + (x+2) = 3x + 3.\]

According to the problem, when the product is divided by the sum, the result is 24. Therefore, we can write another equation:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x + (x+1) + (x+2)} = 24.\]

Substituting the product and the sum into the equation, we get:
\[\frac{120}{3x + 3} = 24.\]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by \(3x + 3\):
\[120 = 24(3x + 3).\]

Next, we distribute the 24 on the right side:
\[120 = 72x + 72.\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract 72 from both sides:
\[48 = 72x.\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64

Solving the first equation:

\[

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Similarly, for \( \triangle AMC \):
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 11^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 121 + CM^2.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( BM = CM \). Let \( BM = CM = x \). Then:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2 \implies AC^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Thus, \( AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} \).

Next, we use the fact that \( AD = 10 \) and \( D \) lies on \( AM \). Let \( AD = d \) and \( DM = 11 - d \). Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\sin \angle BDC = \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta.
\]
Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CAD} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ACD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BAD = \angle CAD = \frac{\theta}{2} \) and \( \angle ABD = \angle ACD = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\sin \angle ABD = \sin \angle ACD = \cos \frac{\theta}{2}.
\]
Thus:
\[
BD = AD \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = AD = 10 \quad \text{and} \quad CD = AD \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = AD = 10.
\]
Therefore, \( BC = BD + CD = 20 \).

Finally, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} + \sqrt{121 + x^2} + 20 = 2\sqrt{121 + x^2} + 20.

Since \( x = 11 \), we have:
\[
2\sqrt{121 + 11^2} + 20 = 2\sqrt{121 + 121} + 20 = 2\sqrt{242} + 20 = 2 \cdot 11\sqrt{2} + 20 = 22\sqrt{2} + 20.

"To find the Ortanca değeri (the middle number) of 27 ardışık pozitif tam sayının toplamı \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these 27 numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) positive integers is given by the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27(27+1)}{2} = \frac{27 \times 28}{2} = 378
\]

However, the problem states that the sum of the 27 ardışık pozitif tam sayının toplamı \(3^7\). First, we calculate \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

So, the sum of the 27 ardışık pozitif tam sayının toplamı is 2187. The Ortanca değeri is the 14th number in this sequence (since the middle number of 27 numbers is the \(\left(\frac{27+1}{2}\right)\)-th number, which is the 14th number). The \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:

\[
a_k = a_1 + (k-1)d
\]

where \(a_1\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference. For our sequence, \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 1\). Therefore, the 14th term \(a_{14}\) is:

\[
a_{14} = 1 + (14-1) \cdot 1 = 1 + 13 = 14

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\).

Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

Next, let's solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we have:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
This means:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:

xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.

Now, substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:

"To determine which class has the number of male otobüs yolcularines closest to 135% of the number of female otobüs yolcularines, we need to calculate the ratio of male to female otobüs yolcularines for each class and then compare these ratios to 135%.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female otobüs yolcularines for each class:

1. **9th Class:**
   - Total students: \(300 + 300 = 600\)
   - Male otobüs yolcularines: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
   - Female otobüs yolcularines: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0425\)

2. **10th Class:**
   - Total students: \(300 + 300 = 600\)
   - Male otobüs yolcularines: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
   - Female otobüs yolcularines: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\)

3. **11th Class:**
   - Total students: \(300 + 300 = 600\)
   - Male otobüs yolcularines: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
   - Female otobüs yolcularines: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\)

4. **12th Class:**
   - Total students: \(300 + 300 = 600\)
   - Male otobüs yolcularines: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
   - Female otobüs yolcularines: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\)

Now, we compare these ratios to 135% (which is 1.35):

- 10th Class: \(1.0404\)
- 11th Class: \(1.5122\)
- 12th Class: \(1.3462\)

The ratio closest to 1.35 is \(1.3462\), which corresponds to the 12th Class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   - Choose \(x = -10\).
   - The numerator \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-10)(-10 - 36) = (-10)(-46) = 460\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   - Choose \(x = -1\).
   - The numerator \(|(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   - Choose \(x = 1\).
   - The numerator \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   - Choose \(x = 10\).
   - The numerator \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((10)(10 - 36) = (10)(-26) = -260\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   - Choose \(x = 37\).
   - The numerator \(|37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), these points are not included in the solution set.

Additionally, the expression is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but since we are looking for where the expression is less than zero, these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

This means that the pist is at the center of the field, and the distance from the pist to any side is half the length of that side.

The pist is also located at the intersection of the two longest sides and the two shortest sides, and it is equidistant from all four sides. This means that the pist is at the center of the field, and the distance from the pist to any side is half the length of that side.

The pist is 400 meters from the longest side and 400 meters from the shortest side. Therefore, the length \( L \) is twice the distance from the pist to the longest side, and the width \( W \) is twice the distance from the pist to the shortest side. So, we have:

Let's denote the length of the side opposite to angle \(T\) as \(a\) and the length of the hypotenuse as \(c\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the side opposite to angle \(T\) is the same as the side adjacent to angle \(R\), and the hypotenuse is the same as the hypotenuse of the triangle.

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substituting this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distributing \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function inside the square root:

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

We take the derivative of \(f(x)\) with respect to \(x\):

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0

Factoring out \(2x\):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

1. For \(x = 0\):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \(x = \sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that the minimum distance is in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we identify \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not a perfect square, we have:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[

   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron, we start by noting that the octahedron has 8 faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite, \( B \) and \( E \) are opposite, and \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite.

Given that the distances from point \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 respectively, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the vertex \( F \).

Since \( A \) and \( F \) are opposite vertices, the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) can be found using the property of the octahedron that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to a pair of opposite vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from that point to the other pair of opposite vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances between the pairs of opposite vertices.

However, in this problem, we can use a simpler approach by considering the fact that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) are given, and we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex \( F \). Since the octahedron is regular, the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E \) are symmetric with respect to the center of the octahedron, and the distance to the sixth vertex \( F \) can be found by using the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is a constant.

Let the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) be \( x \). Then, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = \text{constant}

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:
\[
3^2 = 9, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 9^2 = 81, \quad 11^2 = 121
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

So, we have:
\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

Since the constant is the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices, and we know that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices is 324, the distance \( x \) must be such that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is a constant. Therefore, the distance \( x \) must be the remaining distance that completes the sum to the constant.

Given that the distances are symmetric and the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices is 324, the distance \( x \) must be the remaining distance that completes the sum to the constant. Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices is 324, the distance \( x \) must be the remaining distance that completes the sum to the constant.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We now compare the digits in both representations.

- Base 7 digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- Base 8 digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits between the two representations are \(1, 5,\) and \(6\). Therefore, there are 3 common digits.

"To determine the number of tokalaşmalar que occurred at the ball, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. There are 6 candidates at the ball.
2. Each candidate voted for their favorite candidate, and they all chose their favorite candidate.
3. No candidate was chosen by more than one other candidate, meaning each candidate was chosen by exactly one other candidate.

This implies that the candidates formed a perfect matching, where each candidate is paired with exactly one other candidate. In graph theory terms, this is a 1-regular graph with 6 vertices, which is equivalent to a set of 3 disjoint edges.

Since each edge represents a tokalaşma (where one candidate votes for another), and there are 3 edges in this graph, there were 3 tokalaşmalar.

Therefore, the number of tokalaşmalar that occurred is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), which is equal to \( f(x-1) \), we can use a simple property of polynomials. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) because \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) and the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) = f(0) \).

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial:

\[
f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]
For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, the sums and products of the roots are:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]
We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 + \alpha_1) + \alpha_3(\alpha_4 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (-2)^2 - 0 = 4.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4.
\]
Next, we need to determine the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\). Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the roots must either be all real or come in complex conjugate pairs. If all roots were real, the polynomial would have a positive discriminant, but the discriminant of \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\) is negative, indicating that the roots are not all real. Therefore, the roots must come in complex conjugate pairs. Let's assume the roots are \(\alpha_1 = a + bi\), \(\alpha_2 = a - bi\), \(\alpha_3 = c + di\), and \(\alpha_4 = c - di\). Then:
\[
S_1 = (a + bi)(a - bi) + (c + di)(c - di) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2,
\]
\[
S_2 = (a + bi)(c + di) + (a + bi)(c - di) + (a - bi)(c + di) + (a - bi)(c - di) = 2ac + 2bd + 2ac - 2bd = 4ac,
\]
\[
S_3 = (a + bi)(c - di) + (a - bi)(c + di) + (a - bi)(c - di) + (a + bi)(c + di) = 2ac - 2bd + 2ac + 2bd = 4ac.
\]
Since \(S_2 = S_3\), we have:
\[
S_1 + 2S_2 = 4 \implies a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 + 8ac = 4.
\]
To find the specific values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\), we can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as:
\[
(x^2 + x + 1)(x^2 + x + 2) = 0.
\]
The roots of \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\) are \(\alpha_1 = \omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\alpha_2 = \omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\), and the roots of \(x^2 + x + 2 = 0\) are \(\alpha_3 = -1 + i\) and \(\alpha_4 = -1 - i\). Then:
\[
S_1 = \omega \omega^2 + (-1 + i)(-1 - i) = 1 + 2 = 3,
\]
\[
S_2 = \omega(-1 + i) + \omega(-1 - i) + \omega^2(-1 + i) + \omega^2(-1 - i) = -\omega - \omega^2 - \omega^2 - \omega = -(\omega + \omega^2) - (\omega + \omega^2) = -2(-1) - 2(-1) = 4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \omega(-1 - i) + \omega^2(-1 + i) + \omega(-1 + i) + \omega^2(-1 - i) = -\omega - \omega^2 - \omega - \omega^2 = -2(\omega + \omega^2) = -2(-1) = 2.
\]
Thus, the values of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\) are 3, 4, and 2, respectively. Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one kilogram of apples, let's define the variables first. Let \( k \) be the cost of one kilogram of apples in dollars, and let \( j \) be the cost of the jumbo silo in dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Three kilograms of apples and one jumbo silo cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3k + j = 1.24
   \]
2. Five kilograms of apples and one jumbo silo cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5k + j = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( j \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5k + j) - (3k + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2k = 0.58
\]
Solving for \( k \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
k = 0.29

Since \( k \) is the cost of one kilogram of apples in dollars, we convert this to cents by multiplying by 100:
\[

"To determine the digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) that is not a trailing zero, we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form. We do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 500 is greater than 137, the integer part of the quotient is 0. So, we write \(0.\) and proceed with the division by adding a decimal point and zeros to 137, making it 137.000000...
3. Now, we divide 1370 by 500, which gives 2 with a remainder of 370. So, we write 2 after the decimal point, making the quotient \(0.2\).
4. Next, we divide 3700 by 500, which gives 7 with a remainder of 200. So, we write 7 after the 2, making the quotient \(0.27\).
5. Next, we divide 2000 by 500, which gives 4 with a remainder of 0. So, we write 4 after the 7, making the quotient \(0.274\).

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete. The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

In the decimal \(0.274\), the digit in the decimal expansion that is not a trailing zero is 4. Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\), with \(a = kb\) for some positive constant \(k\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\), \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\), \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\), and \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if it lies inside the circle centered at \(O\) with radius equal to the distance from \(O\) to any vertex. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}\).

The area of the circle is:

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:

\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given values step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have after converting their earnings into rupees, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned in dollars.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars to rupees.
3. Determine how much money they have after converting the rupees into banknotes.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they earned in dollars:
\[
\text{Total earnings in dollars} = \text{Linda's earnings} + \text{Sherry's earnings} + \text{June's earnings} + \text{Connie's earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings in dollars} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they earned in dollars is $126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount from dollars to rupees. The exchange rate is 1 dollar = 75 rupees. Therefore:
\[
\text{Total earnings in rupees} = 126.59 \times 75
\]

Calculating this:
\[
126.59 \times 75 = 9494.25
\]

So, the total amount of money they have in rupees is 9494.25 rupees.

Now, we convert this total amount into banknotes. The banknote denominations are 100, 50, 20, 10, 5, and 1 rupee. We start with the largest denomination and work our way down:

1. The largest denomination is 100 rupees. We can use 94 banknotes of 100 rupees:
\[
94 \times 100 = 9400 \text{ rupees}
\]
2. The remaining amount is:
\[
9494.25 - 9400 = 94.25 \text{ rupees}
\]
3. The next largest denomination is 50 rupees. We can use 1 banknote of 50 rupees:
\[
1 \times 50 = 50 \text{ rupees}
\]
4. The remaining amount is:
\[
94.25 - 50 = 44.25 \text{ rupees}
\]
5. The next largest denomination is 20 rupees. We can use 2 banknotes of 20 rupees:
\[
2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ rupees}
\]
6. The remaining amount is:
\[
44.25 - 40 = 4.25 \text{ rupees}
\]
7. The next largest denomination is 1 rupee. We can use 4 banknotes of 1 rupee:
\[
4 \times 1 = 4 \text{ rupees}
\]
8. The remaining amount is:
\[
4.25 - 4 = 0.25 \text{ rupees}
\]

Since 0.25 rupees is less than the smallest denomination of 1 rupee, we do not need to use any smaller banknotes. Therefore, the total amount of money they have after converting the rupees into banknotes is:
\[
94 \times 100 + 1 \times 50 + 2 \times 20 + 4 \times 1 = 9400 + 50 + 40 + 4 = 9494 \text{ rupees}
\]

Finally, we convert this total amount back into rupees and then into sent. Since 1 rupee is equal to 100 sent, we have:
\[
9494 \text{ rupees} \times 100 = 949400 \text{ sent}

Thus, the amount of money they have after converting the rupees into banknotes and then converting the banknotes back into sent is:

However, the problem states that Jim ve Martha, dikdörtgen bir tarlanın köşesinde birlikte duruyorlar. This means they are traveling towards each other, not in opposite directions. Therefore, the total distance they travel together is the length of the tarlan, which is 400 feet.

Since Jim travels 200 feet and Martha travels 200 feet, the total distance they travel together is:
\[ \text{Total distance traveled} = 200 \text{ feet} + 200 \text{ feet} = 400 \text{ feet} \]

Since the tarlan is 400 feet long, they meet exactly at the midpoint, and the distance each person travels is 200 feet. Therefore, Jim is not shorter than Martha, but they are traveling the same distance.

The correct interpretation of the problem is that Jim and Martha are traveling towards each other, and the distance each person travels is 200 feet. Therefore, the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha is:
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} - 200 \text{ feet} = 0 \text{ feet} \]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]

First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) into the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance from point \( A \) to the triangle \( BCD \), we need to consider the perpendicular distance from point \( A \) to each of the sides \( BC \), \( CD \), and \( DB \) of the triangle \( BCD \). The shortest distance will be the perpendicular distance to the side that is closest to point \( A \).

First, let's find the equations of the sides of triangle \( BCD \):
- The coordinates of \( B \) are \( (3, 0) \) and the coordinates of \( C \) are \( (0, -4) \). The slope of \( BC \) is \( \frac{-4 - 0}{0 - 3} = \frac{4}{3} \). The equation of the line \( BC \) is:
  \[
  y = \frac{4}{3}(x - 3) = \frac{4}{3}x - 4
  \]
- The coordinates of \( C \) are \( (0, -4) \) and the coordinates of \( D \) are \( (0, 0) \). The line \( CD \) is a vertical line with the equation:
  \[
  x = 0
  \]
- The coordinates of \( D \) are \( (0, 0) \) and the coordinates of \( B \) are \( (3, 0) \). The line \( DB \) is a horizontal line with the equation:
  \[
  y = 0
  \]

Next, we calculate the perpendicular distances from point \( A \) to each of these sides:
1. The perpendicular distance from \( A \) to the line \( BC \) is given by the formula for the distance from a point to a line:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
  \]
  where the line is \( ax + by + c = 0 \). For the line \( BC \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = -12 \). The coordinates of \( A \) are \( (-3, 3) \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = \frac{|4(-3) + (-3)(3) + (-12)|}{\sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}} = \frac{|-12 - 9 - 12|}{\sqrt{16 + 9}} = \frac{33}{5}
  \]
2. The perpendicular distance from \( A \) to the line \( CD \) is the horizontal distance from \( A \) to \( x = 0 \):
  \[
  \text{Distance} = |x_A - x_C| = |-3 - 0| = 3
  \]
3. The perpendicular distance from \( A \) to the line \( DB \) is the vertical distance from \( A \) to \( y = 0 \):
  \[
  \text{Distance} = |y_A - y_D| = |3 - 0| = 3
  \]

The shortest distance from point \( A \) to the triangle \( BCD \) is the minimum of these distances:
\[
\min\left(\frac{33}{5}, 3, 3\right) = 3
\]

Therefore, the shortest distance from point \( A \) to the triangle \( BCD \) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",13,"[13, '13']",True
