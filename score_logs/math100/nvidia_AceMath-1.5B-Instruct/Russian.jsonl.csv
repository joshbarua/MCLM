"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) and \(F\) have the same \(y\)-coordinate, the distance \(EF\) is simply the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates:
\[
EF = |0 - \sqrt{51}| = \sqrt{51}
\]
However, we are given that \(EF = 7\), so we need to use this information to find the correct coordinates of \(D\). Let's assume \(D\) is at \((x, 7)\). Then the distance \(EF\) is:
\[
|0 - x| = |x| = 7
\]
This gives us two possible values for \(x\): \(x = 7\) or \(x = -7\). Since \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\), we must have \(x = 7\). Therefore, \(D\) is at \((7, 7)\).

Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((7, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance \(DE\) is the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates:
\[
DE = |7 - 0| = 7

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise:**
   A counter-clockwise rotation by \( \theta \) is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. The square root of \(11^2\) is 11, and the square root of 2 is \(\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, we have:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that three specific people, Пьер, Роза, and Томас, sit together, we can treat them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of the three people within the block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Пьер, Роза, and Томас within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Пьер, Роза, and Томас sit together is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, meaning it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} \) and still look the same.

Here are the steps to find the solution:

1. Identify the order of rotational symmetry of the pentagon. For a regular pentagon, the order of rotational symmetry is 5.
2. Calculate the smallest angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself. This angle is given by dividing 360 degrees by the order of rotational symmetry:
   \[
   \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, let's denote the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) as:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
1. \(\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6\)
2. \(\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}\)

Let's solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the sum of the coordinates is consistent with the given conditions.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct value of \(x\) should be 8 (since \(x > 7\)) and the correct value of \(y\) should be 3 (since the sum of the coordinates should be consistent with the given conditions).

Thus, the correct value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 3 = 11

"To find the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same point. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

Next, we add \(99\) to \(9801\):
\[9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

Finally, we add \(1\) to \(9900\):
\[9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:
\[45 + 8 = 53.\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified expression is:

- Let \( T \) be the weight of one three-truck.
- Let \( C \) be the weight of one cube.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one gummy.

From the problem, we have the following equations:

First, we will solve the system of equations for \( C \) and \( G \) in terms of \( T \).

From the second equation, solve for \( C \):

\[
10T = 6T + 3G + G

\[

12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the level of water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (which is \( \pi r^2 \)) multiplied by the rate at which the height is rising (which is 4 meters per hour).

So, we can write:
\[ \text{Rate of volume increase} = \text{Cross-sectional area} \times \text{Rate of height increase} \]
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \times 4 \]

To find \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the reservoir is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise and ensure that it covers all possible \(y\)-values.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
  \[ f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]
  As \(x\) increases, \(f(x)\) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
  \[ f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]
  As \(x\) decreases, \(f(x)\) decreases without bound. Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

- If \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing. As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

### Step 3: Combine the ranges
To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, the ranges of the two pieces must cover all real numbers. This means that the minimum value of the function for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of the function for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value is \(a^3\) and the maximum value is \(a^2 + 2a\). We need:
  \[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
  Dividing both sides by \(a\) (since \(a > 0\)):
  \[ a^2 \leq a + 2. \]
  Rearranging terms:
  \[ a^2 - a - 2 \leq 0. \]
  Factoring the quadratic:
  \[ (a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
  The solutions to this inequality are \(-1 \leq a \leq 2\). Since \(a > 0\), we have:
  \[ 0 < a \leq 2. \]

- If \(a < 0\), the maximum value is \(a^2 + 2a\) and the minimum value is \(-\infty\). Since the minimum value is always less than any real number, this condition is always satisfied for \(a < 0\).

### Step 4: Determine the largest value of \(a\)
The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:

\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x. \]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0, \]
\[ x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0. \]

This equation has two solutions:

\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

For \(x = 0\) to be a valid solution, it must be in the interval \([0,1]\), which it is. For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be a valid solution, it must also be in the interval \([0,1]\). This requires:

\[ 0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1. \]

Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a valid solution for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:

\[ f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x. \]

Substituting \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), the polynomial must have a root in \([0,1]\) other than \(x = 0\) or \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

We already know that \(x = 0\) is a root. Let's consider the other root \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation, we get:

\[ f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}. \]

So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f\), which means \(f(f(x)) = x\) is satisfied for \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

To ensure there is another solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to check the behavior of the function \(f\) and its composition \(f(f(x))\) for \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\).

"To find the degree measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which the given equation holds, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side of the equation. The given expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter I, \( n_3 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter P, \( n_4 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter S, \( n_5 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_6 \), is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42.

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher powers of 5 will also be zero, we can stop here. Summing these values gives:

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points. The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:

From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0,

\[

From the second equation, we can solve for \( x \):

Squaring both sides, we get:

The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

Equating the two expressions, we get:

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is the positive root, we have:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}. \]

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Using the identity for the cosine of a multiple angle, we know that \( \cos 85\theta \) can be expressed in terms of \( \cos \theta \) and \( \sin \theta \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \theta \) is a multiple of \( \frac{2\pi}{5} \) because \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \), which is related to the fifth roots of unity.

Thus, \( 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi \), and we have:

\[ \cos 85\theta = \cos 34\pi = 1. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(MGN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the centroid to the sides, which is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(GBC\). Since \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio \(2:1\), the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle GBC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48
\]

The area of triangle \(GBC\) is also the sum of the areas of triangles \(GMB\) and \(GNC\). Since \(M\) and \(N\) are on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively and \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(GMB\) and \(GNC\) are similar to triangle \(ABC\) and have the same height from \(G\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(GMB\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(GBC\).

\[
\text{Area of } \triangle GMB = \frac{1}{3} \times 48 = 16

"To determine what fraction of the remaining books on the three polishes are books on mathematics, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine how many books are removed from each polynomial.
3. Calculate the number of books remaining on each polynomial.
4. Find the total number of remaining books.
5. Determine the fraction of the remaining books that are books on mathematics.

Let's start with the given information:
- Total number of books on all three polishes: 24
- Number of books on the upper polynomial: 8
- Number of books on the middle polynomial: 10
- Number of books on the lower polynomial: 6
- Number of books removed from each polynomial: 2

First, we calculate the number of books remaining on each polynomial after removing 2 books from each:
- Remaining books on the upper polynomial: \(8 - 2 = 6\)
- Remaining books on the middle polynomial: \(10 - 2 = 8\)
- Remaining books on the lower polynomial: \(6 - 2 = 4\)

Next, we find the total number of remaining books:
\[6 + 8 + 4 = 18\]

Now, we determine the fraction of the remaining books that are books on mathematics. The number of books on mathematics remaining is 8, and the total number of remaining books is 18. Therefore, the fraction is:
\[\frac{8}{18}\]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 2:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by defining the general form of an arithmetic sequence. The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general form of the arithmetic sequence, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit numbers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:

This implies that \( k = 2^{24/n} \), and since \( k \) must be an integer, \( 24/n \) must be an integer. Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are the numbers that divide 24 without leaving a remainder. We can find them by checking each positive integer up to 24:

"To determine how many five-cent coins are in the collection of eleven coins that total 75 cents, we can set up a system of linear equations. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of five-cent coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of ten-cent coins.

We know two things from the problem statement:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 5x + 10y = 75 \) (since each five-cent coin is worth 5 cents and each ten-cent coin is worth 10 cents)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + 2y = 15 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( x + 2y = 15 \)

To eliminate \( x \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ x + 2y - x - y = 4 \]
\[ y = 4 \]

So, there are 4 ten-cent coins. Now, we substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the first equation to find \( x \):

   - The chess piece will be placed at the intersection of the row and column determined by the numbers on the wheel.

4. **Determine the number of black cells that meet the conditions:**
   - There are 4 rows and 4 columns, so there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) possible cells where the chess piece could be placed.
   - In a 4x4 subgrid of a chessboard, there are 8 black cells and 8 white cells. This is because each 2x2 subgrid of a chessboard contains 2 black and 2 white cells, and a 4x4 subgrid contains 4 such 2x2 subgrids.

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the chess piece will be placed on a black cell is the number of black cells divided by the total number of cells where the chess piece could be placed. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the chess piece will be placed on a black cell is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To find the sum of the digits in the final decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(2\), \(1\), \(6\), and \(5\). Adding these digits together, we get:
\[

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote these roots by \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \) is given by \( -a \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49.
\]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \), which is equivalent to \( f(x+5) = 0 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34.

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-x) = -\sin x\), we have \(\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression that:

\[
\cos 10^\circ \cos 40^\circ \cos 70^\circ = \frac{\sin 80^\circ}{8 \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{\cos 10^\circ}{8 \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{8 \tan 10^\circ}.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{8 \tan 10^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{64 \tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{64 \tan^2 10^\circ}} = 3 \times 16 = 48.

So, we have:

\[

Thus, the original expression is:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all its interior angles, except one, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles of the polygon with one angle missing:**
   If one angle is missing, the sum of the remaining interior angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(measure of the missing angle)}
   \]
   We know this sum is \(1070^\circ\), so we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(measure of the missing angle)} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Estimate the range for the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must be greater than \(0^\circ\) and less than \(180^\circ\).

4. **Find the range for \(n\):**
   First, we need to find the range for \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the left inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Simplifying the right inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8

5. **Combine the results:**
   From the two inequalities, we get:

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23} \]

Next, we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 6^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 8^2 \equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 9^2 \equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 11^2 \equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23} \]

We see that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \) and \( 13^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \) (since \( 13 \equiv -10 \pmod{23} \)). Therefore, the square roots of 8 modulo 23 are 10 and 13.

Substituting these back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \equiv \frac{8}{2} \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \equiv \frac{-12}{2} \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \).

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) that satisfies the given conditions is:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[ d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} \]

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates will be strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to count the integer points that lie strictly between the given points.

First, let's identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for the points inside the rectangle:
- The \(x\)-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\), but since we are looking for points strictly inside, \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\).
- The \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\), but since we are looking for points strictly inside, \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\).

Now, we count the number of integer points in this range:
- For each \(x\) value from \(-4\) to \(4\), there are 7 possible \(y\) values: \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\).
- There are 9 possible \(x\) values: \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).

Therefore, the total number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle is:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

"To find the average price of Juan's stamp collection from the 70s, we need to calculate the total number of stamps and the total value of these stamps, and then divide the total value by the total number of stamps.

First, let's identify the number of stamps and their values for each decade in the 70s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps, each worth 12 cents
- France: 12 stamps, each worth 12 cents
- Peru: 6 stamps, each worth 4 cents
- Spain: 9 stamps, each worth 9 cents

Next, we calculate the total number of stamps:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the segments as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

Given that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be found using the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\) in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AC = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot d
\]

Thus, the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot d + \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c = \frac{1}{2} (b \cdot d + a \cdot c)
\]

We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (b \cdot d + a \cdot c) = 42 \implies b \cdot d + a \cdot c = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have:
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

This implies that \(a = c\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot a = \frac{1}{2} a^2
\]

To find \(a^2\), we use the fact that \(b \cdot d + a \cdot a = 84\). Since \(b = \frac{a^2}{a} = a\), we have:
\[
a \cdot d + a \cdot a = 84 \implies a \cdot d + a^2 = 84
\]

However, we need to find the correct relationship between \(a\) and \(d\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\) in \(\triangle ABC\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
d^2 + c^2 = b^2
\]

Since \(b = a\), we have:
\[
d^2 + a^2 = a^2 \implies d^2 = 0 \implies d = 0
\]

This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the correct relationship. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\) in \(\triangle ABC\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot b \cdot d = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot d
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot a = \frac{1}{2} a^2
\]

Since \(a = c\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} a^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 21 = 21

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the denominators by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9

This simplifies to:

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can use geometric probability and combinatorial arguments.

First, consider the circle and the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on it. The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the four points, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the other three points relative to it. This leaves us with \(3!\) (6) permutations of the remaining points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. The area \(A_{\text{large}}\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{large}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area \(A_{\text{shaded}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{shaded}} = \frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}

   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. The area \(A_{\text{small}}\) of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   A_{\text{small}} = \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi
   \]

4. **Determine the area of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded:**
   The area of the sector of the larger circle that is not shaded is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the shaded region:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector, large}} = 4\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{12\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{3}

   The area of a sector of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{sector}} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi r^2

   For the larger circle, the radius \(r\) is 2 and the area of the sector is \(\frac{7\pi}{3}\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot \pi \cdot 2^2 = \frac{7\pi}{3}

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{7\pi}{3}

   Dividing both sides by \(\pi\):

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical stakán, \( r = 3 \) cm and \( h = 8 \) cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reservoir. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},

\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},

\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

\[ 20 \text{ feet/minute} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches/minute} \]

Next, we convert the speed from inches per minute to inches per second by dividing by 60:
\[ 240 \text{ inches/minute} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 4 \text{ inches/second} \]

Therefore, the speed of the velohiped, expressed in inches per second, is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members minus the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that are all Democrats:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by testing some integer values for \(x\):

If \(x = 4\):
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120.\]
So, \(x = 4\) is a solution.

If \(x = 5\):
\[5 \cdot 6 \cdot 7 = 210.\]
So, \(x = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(x = 3\):
\[3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 60.\]
So, \(x = 3\) is not a solution.

Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\).

Next, we need to verify the second condition of the problem, which states that the product of these three integers, divided by their average, equals 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5.\]
Now, we divide the product by the average:
\[\frac{4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24.\]
So, the second condition is also satisfied.

The largest of the three consecutive integers is \(6\).

"To find the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \( 4096 = 64^2 \), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

In our case, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{AB}.
\]

Since \( AD = 10 \), \( MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). Now, consider \( \triangle BDM \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\sin 3\theta = \frac{MD}{BM} = \frac{1}{BM}.
\]

We know that \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \). Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \), we get:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right) - 4 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^3 = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{4 \cdot 121}{AB^3} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \sin 3\theta \), we have:
\[
\frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} = \frac{1}{BM}.
\]

Since \( BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \), we substitute \( BM \) into the equation:
\[
\frac{33}{AB} - \frac{484}{AB^3} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}.
\]

To find \( AB \), we can use the fact that \( \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}{AB} \). From the identity \( \sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1 \), we have:
\[
\left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}{AB} \right)^2 = 1 \implies \frac{121}{AB^2} + \frac{AB^2 - 121}{AB^2} = 1 \implies \frac{AB^2}{AB^2} = 1,
\]
which is true for any \( AB \). However, we need to find the specific value of \( AB \) that satisfies the given conditions. By trial and error or solving the equation, we find that \( AB = 22 \).

Thus, \( BM = \sqrt{22^2 - 121} = \sqrt{484 - 121} = \sqrt{363} = 11\sqrt{3} \).

Now, we can find \( BC \):

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)

We set this equal to \(3^7\):

\[

Solving for \(a\):

\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), which is always greater than \(-4\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[

\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:

\[

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).

Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[

\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[

\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,

\[

We now have two equations:

2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:

2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   - Choose \(x = -10\).
   - The numerator \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-10)(-10 - 36) = (-10)(-46) = 460\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   - Choose \(x = -1\).
   - The numerator \(|(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   - Choose \(x = 1\).
   - The numerator \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   - Choose \(x = 10\).
   - The numerator \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((10)(10 - 36) = (10)(-26) = -260\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   - Choose \(x = 37\).
   - The numerator \(|37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), these points are not included in the solution set.

Additionally, the expression is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), but since we are looking for where the expression is less than zero, these points are not included in the solution set.

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the dimensions of the field. Let the length of the field be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The diameter of the semicircles at each end of the rectangle is equal to the width \( W \), so the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the Dorожka is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The length of the two straight sides is \( 2L \), and the circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi W}{2} \). Since there are two semicircles, the total circumference is \( \pi W \). Therefore, the total length of the Dorожka is:
\[
2L + \pi W
\]
We know that the total length of the Dorожka is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We want to maximize the area \( A \) of the field, which is given by:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
We can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) using the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]
The area \( A \) is then:
\[
A = L \cdot W = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]
Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the angle \(T\) is the complement of angle \(R\). The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin{T} = \cos{R}
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos{R}\). In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. In \(\triangle RST\), the adjacent side to angle \(R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). We know that \(RT = 5\) and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), which means the opposite side to angle \(R\) is 2. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(ST\):

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we can find \(\cos{R}\):

\[

\]

Since \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\), we have:

\[

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a \) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we find \( a + b \):

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the distances from \( P \) to the five given vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other, and the distance between each pair is the same. Let the distance between each pair of opposite vertices be \( d \).

The point \( P \) can be inside or outside the octahedron. We will consider both cases.

### Case 1: Point \( P \) is inside the octahedron
If \( P \) is inside the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the four pairs of opposite vertices. Let the distances from \( P \) to the sixth vertex be \( x \). Then we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 2(3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2)

Calculating the squares, we get:

\[

\[

\[
x^2 = 82

\[
x = \sqrt{82}
\]

### Case 2: Point \( P \) is outside the octahedron
If \( P \) is outside the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the four pairs of opposite vertices plus four times the square of the distance from \( P \) to the center of the octahedron. However, since the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given and the distances between opposite vertices are the same, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the four pairs of opposite vertices is the same as in the previous case. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is the same as in the first case.

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the_softer ball (Djoy) to the acceleration of the heavier ball (Gjan), we start with the formula for force, which states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Djoy and Gjan are using the same force to throw their balls, we can set the force \( F \) equal for both. Let \( F \) be the force applied by both Djoy and Gjan. Let \( m_D \) be the mass of the ball Djoy throws and \( a_D \) be the acceleration of the ball Djoy throws. Similarly, let \( m_G \) be the mass of the ball Gjan throws and \( a_G \) be the acceleration of the ball Gjan. According to the formula, we have:

\[ F = m_D \cdot a_D \]
\[ F = m_G \cdot a_G \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the right-hand sides of the equations equal to each other:

\[ m_D \cdot a_D = m_G \cdot a_G \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Djoy's ball to the acceleration of Gjan's ball, which is \( \frac{a_D}{a_G} \). We can solve for \( a_D \) in terms of \( a_G \):

\[ a_D = \frac{m_G}{m_D} \cdot a_G \]

Therefore, the ratio \( \frac{a_D}{a_G} \) is:

\[ \frac{a_D}{a_G} = \frac{\frac{m_G}{m_D} \cdot a_G}{a_G} = \frac{m_G}{m_D} \]

Given that the mass of Djoy's ball \( m_D \) is 200 grams and the mass of Gjan's ball \( m_G \) is 150 grams, we substitute these values into the ratio:

\[ \frac{a_D}{a_G} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Thus, the ratio of the acceleration of the ball Djoy throws to the acceleration of the ball Gjan throws is:

\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\), so \(a = kb\) since \(AB/AD = k\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\).

The region where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four circles centered at \(O\) with radii equal to the distances from \(O\) to each vertex. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore, the region of interest is the circle centered at \(O\) with radius \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

The area of this circle is:
\[
\pi \left(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\right)^2 = \pi (a^2 + b^2)
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

Since \(a = kb\), the area of the rectangle can be rewritten as:
\[
4ab = 4(kb)b = 4kb^2
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{4ab} = \frac{\pi (k^2b^2 + b^2)}{4kb^2} = \frac{\pi b^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4kb^2} = \frac{\pi (k^2 + 1)}{4k}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 9 \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54
\]

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

\[
r = a - bq = 54 - 54 = 0
\]

Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is \( \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is \( \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (8^{1/3})^2 = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is \( \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, remained after Linda, Шерries, Джun, and Konni exchanged their money, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they collected together.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents.
3. Determine how many dollars and cents they exchanged and how many cents remained.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they collected together:
\[
\text{Total amount} = \text{Linda's earnings} + \text{Sherry's earnings} + \text{Gjun's earnings} + \text{Conni's earnings}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they collected is $126.59.

Next, we convert the total amount from dollars to cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many dollars and cents they exchanged and how many cents remained. Since they exchanged as many dollars as possible, we first convert the total amount back to dollars and cents:
\[
12659 \text{ cents} = 126 \text{ dollars and } 59 \text{ cents}
\]

They exchanged all the dollars, so they exchanged 126 dollars. Since each dollar is equal to 100 cents, the total amount exchanged is:
\[
126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}
\]

The remaining cents after the exchange are:
\[
12659 - 12600 = 59 \text{ cents}
\]

Therefore, the amount of money that remained after they exchanged as many dollars as possible is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the test, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Determine the total score for each group of students:
   - 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for this group is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for this group is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for this group is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

3. Divide the overall total score by the number of students to find the average score:

Therefore, the average score of the test is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given magic square is valid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \). Let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the square to be magic, the sum of the second row must also be \( 2n + 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) works by substituting \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and checking the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

The magic square becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\

\]

Let's check the sum of the first row:

\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the second row:

\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the third row:

\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the first column:

\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the second column:

\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the third column:

\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the main diagonal:

\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

Let's check the sum of the other diagonal:

\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how much shorter the path that Джим takes compared to the path that Marta takes, we need to calculate the lengths of both paths and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the length of the path that Джим takes. Since Джим walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]
Given that the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, the length of the path that Джим takes is 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the length of the path that Marta takes. Marta walks along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Length of Marta's path} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]
Now, we find the difference between the length of Marta's path and the length of Джим's path:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Length of Marta's path} - \text{Length of Джим's path} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, the path that Джим takes is \(\boxed{200}\) feet shorter than the path that Marta takes.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True

- \( B + D + C + A = 3 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 \)

The minimum distance starting at \( B \) is 15.

### Starting at Point \( C \)
The possible permutations of \( A, B, D \) are \( ABD, ADB, BAD, BDA, DAB, DBA \). We calculate the total distance for each permutation:

- \( D + C + A + B = 0 + 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \)
- \( D + C + B + A = 0 + 6 + 4 + 5 = 15 \)

The minimum distance starting at \( D \) is 12.
