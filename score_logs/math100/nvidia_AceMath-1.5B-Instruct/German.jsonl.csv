"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the length \(EF\) is simply the difference in the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), which is \(7 - 0 = 7\) units. This confirms that the y-coordinate of \(E\) is indeed 7.

Next, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the plane is given by the distance formula:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\) into the formula, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise of a complex number \( a + bi \) is equivalent to multiplying it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i - 3(-1) = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor separately:

"To determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) at a round table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units to arrange in a circle, so the number of ways to arrange these 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of distinct seating arrangements is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units in a circle and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}

Now, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

So:
\[

"To determine how many degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to return to its original position, we need to consider the properties of a regular pentagon and its rotational symmetry.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after every rotation that is a multiple of the angle corresponding to one of its sides. This angle is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full circle) by the number of sides of the pentagon.

For a pentagon, the number of sides is 5. Therefore, the angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Thus, the pentagon must be rotated at least \(\boxed{72}\) degrees to return to its original position.","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and the value of \(x + y\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the points \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the points \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Since \(x > 7\) is not satisfied by \(x = 6\), there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. However, based on the given problem and the correct calculation, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[

Given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute this into the tangent function:

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and then sum them up, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)
Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5}. \]","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

\[9801 + 99 = 9900.\]

Finally, we add \(1\) to \(9900\):

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm (or induced norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

\[

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to compute the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Treeks are equivalent in weight to one Squig. Let's start by defining the weights of the Treeks, Squigs, and Goolees in terms of each other.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

2. Two Treeks and one Goolee weigh as much as one Squig.

Let's denote the weight of a Treek as \( T \), the weight of a Squig as \( S \), and the weight of a Goolee as \( G \). We can translate the given relationships into the following equations:
1. \( 10T = 3S + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)

We need to find the value of \( T \) in terms of \( S \). First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):

First, let's expand the product:

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank.

We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \).

To find the radius \( r \), we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) piecewise and ensure that it is continuous and covers all possible \(y\)-values.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left and from the right:
- As \(x \to a^-\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\), so \(\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a^2 + 2a\).
- As \(x \to a^+\), \(f(x) = ax^2\), so \(\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a^3\).

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\).

Next, we need to determine which of these values of \(a\) ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once. We will analyze each case:

1. If \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x \geq 0, \\
0 & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]
This is a constant function \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), so it intersects every horizontal line except \(y = 1\) (and no others). Therefore, \(a = 0\) is not a valid solution.

2. If \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2, \\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]
For \(x \geq 2\), \(f(x) = 2x^2 \geq 8\). For \(x < 2\), \(f(x) = 2x + 4\) ranges from \(-\infty\) to 8. Therefore, \(f(x)\) covers all \(y \geq 8\) and all \(y < 8\), so it intersects every horizontal line at least once. Therefore, \(a = 2\) is a valid solution.

3. If \(a = -1\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1, \\
-x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1.
\end{cases}
\]
For \(x \geq -1\), \(f(x) = -x^2 \leq -1\). For \(x < -1\), \(f(x) = -x - 2\) ranges from \(-\infty\) to \(-1\). Therefore, \(f(x)\) covers all \(y \leq -1\) and all \(y > -1\), so it intersects every horizontal line at least once. Therefore, \(a = -1\) is a valid solution.

The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the radius of the circle 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is also satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a polynomial equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(f(x))\).

For \(\lambda = 4\), the function \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\) has a maximum value of 1 at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{3}{4}\). The function \(f(f(x))\) will have a periodic point of period 2 for \(\lambda = 4\).

For \(1 < \lambda < 4\), the function \(f(x)\) has a maximum value of \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) at \(x = \frac{\lambda}{2}\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). The function \(f(f(x))\) will have a periodic point of period 2 for \(1 < \lambda < 4\).

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which the given equation holds, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side of the equation. The given equation is:

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to further simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S, and S is 1 each.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the integers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function's symmetry and possible critical points.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points. The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},

From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[

\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = y^2 x^2,

\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - y^2 = x^2,

\[
x^2 = 1 - y^2,

\[
x = \pm \sqrt{1 - y^2}.

Since \( x \ge y \), we have \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Substituting \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into \( x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \), we get:
\[
x = \sqrt{1 - (-\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2} = \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} = \sqrt{x^2} = x,

Thus,

We need to find \( \cos 85 \theta \). Notice that \( \theta \) is a multiple of \( \frac{2\pi}{5} \) because \( \cos \frac{2\pi}{5} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Therefore, \( 85 \theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi \), and:

\[ \cos 34\pi = \cos 0 = 1. \]

1. **Identify the properties of the centroid \(G\):**
   The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height. We are given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence. The \(n\)-th term \(a_n\) of an arithmetic sequence can be expressed as:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where \(a_1\) is the first term and \(d\) is the common difference.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general form of the \(n\)-th term, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common factors of 100 and 150 that are two-digit numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are \(2\) and \(5^2\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:

Next, we list all the factors of 50:

We are only interested in the two-digit factors of 50. From the list above, the two-digit factors are:

"To determine for how many positive integer values of \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} = k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \), because the exponent of 2 on the left side of the equation is 24, and the exponent of 2 on the right side is \( n \log_2 k \), which must be an integer.

Therefore, we need to find the number of positive divisors of 24, excluding 1 (since \( n > 1 \)).

First, we find the prime factorization of 24:
\[ 24 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \]

The number of positive divisors of a number \( p^a \times q^b \times \cdots \times r^c \) is given by \( (a+1)(b+1) \cdots (c+1) \). Applying this to our factorization of 24, we get:
\[ (3+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

So, the positive divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. Therefore, the valid values of \( n \) are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

Thus, there are 7 positive integer values of \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power. The answer is:

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total number of coins is 75.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 75 \) (since the total number of coins is 75)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \) (since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents, and the total value is 75 cents)

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
d + n = 75 \\
10d + 5n = 75
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can use the method of substitution or elimination. Here, we will use the elimination method. First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[
2d + n = 15
\]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[
\begin{cases}
d + n = 75 \\
2d + n = 15

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( n \):
\[
(2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 75

\[
2d + n - d - n = -60
\]
\[
d = -60

\[
-60 + n = 75

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to determine the parity (odd or even) of each of these prime numbers. The even prime number is 2, and the odd prime numbers are 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Therefore, there is 1 even number and 5 odd numbers among the first six prime numbers.

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In this case, since there is only one even number (2), the only way to get an even sum is if both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers.

Now, we calculate the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers. The probability that Paul chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Jesse chooses an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Since the choices are independent, the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose odd numbers is:

"To determine the probability that the game piece lands on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to analyze the process of generating the coordinates and the properties of the chessboard.

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each coordinate:**
   - The first coordinate is obtained by dividing the number of times the pointer is rotated by 4. Since the pointer can land on any of the 8 numbers on the radian, the possible remainders when divided by 4 are 0, 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the first coordinate can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - The second coordinate is obtained by dividing the number of times the pointer is rotated by 5. Since the pointer can land on any of the 8 numbers on the radian, the possible remainders when divided by 5 are 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Therefore, the second coordinate can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since the first coordinate can be any of 4 values and the second coordinate can be any of 5 values, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

3. **Identify the shaded squares on the chessboard:**
   - A standard chessboard has 64 squares, with 32 shaded squares and 32 unshaded squares. The shaded squares are arranged in a checkerboard pattern, with alternating shaded and unshaded squares.

4. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - We need to count the number of pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) is the first coordinate, \(b\) is the second coordinate, and the pair \((a, b)\) corresponds to a shaded square on the chessboard. Since the coordinates are generated randomly and each pair is equally likely, the number of favorable outcomes is the number of shaded squares on the chessboard, which is 32.

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{32}{20} = \frac{8}{5}\).

However, we need to re-evaluate the problem because the coordinates are not directly corresponding to the shaded squares. The correct approach is to consider the probability of landing on a shaded square based on the properties of the coordinates.

- The first coordinate can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, and the second coordinate can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4. The pairs \((a, b)\) that correspond to shaded squares are:
  - \((0, 0)\)
  - \((0, 1)\)
  - \((0, 2)\)
  - \((0, 3)\)
  - \((0, 4)\)
  - \((1, 0)\)
  - \((1, 1)\)
  - \((1, 2)\)
  - \((1, 3)\)
  - \((1, 4)\)
  - \((2, 0)\)
  - \((2, 1)\)
  - \((2, 2)\)
  - \((2, 3)\)
  - \((2, 4)\)
  - \((3, 0)\)
  - \((3, 1)\)
  - \((3, 2)\)
  - \((3, 3)\)
  - \((3, 4)\)

There are 20 such pairs, and the total number of possible outcomes is 20. Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{16}{20} = \frac{4}{5}\).

"To find the sum of the digits in the end finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, calculate the denominator:
\[
5^7 = 78125
\]
\[
2^8 = 256
\]
\[
5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

Now, convert the fraction \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) to a decimal:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

The end finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). To find the sum of the digits in this decimal, we identify the digits: \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\).

Now, sum these digits:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \frac{3}{4} \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 \left(\sin 40^\circ\right)^2 \left(\sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we get:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \) and its roots. The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 70^\circ) + (1 + \tan^2 50^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 30^\circ\), and \(C = 50^\circ\), but we can use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in a different form. We know that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 50^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles except one:**
   If the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the sum of all interior angles is \(1070^\circ + x\), where \(x\) is the measure of the missing interior angle.

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of all interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Because \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\) must be slightly more than \(1070^\circ\).

4. **Find the range for \(n\):**
   First, we find the approximate value of \(n\) by solving the equation without considering \(x\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1070}{180} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Adding 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n \approx 7.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 8. Therefore, \(n\) could be 7 or 8.

5. **Verify the possible values of \(n\):**
   - For \(n = 7\):
     \[
     (7-2) \times 180^\circ = 5 \times 180^\circ = 900^\circ
     \]
     So, the missing angle \(x\) would be:
     \[
     x = 900^\circ - 1070^\circ = -170^\circ
     \]
     This is not possible because an interior angle cannot be negative.

   - For \(n = 8\):
     \[
     (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
     \]
     So, the missing angle \(x\) would be:
     \[
     x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
     \]
     This is possible because an interior angle can be \(10^\circ\).

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic equation are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since we are looking for a positive integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and take \( t = 4 \). However, we need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd, and it is not. We need to re-evaluate our approach to ensure we have the correct solution.

\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since \( t = 4 \) is even, we need to re-evaluate the correct solution. The correct solution is:

\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = 1 \text{ foot}

2. **Calculate the surface area of the cube:**
   The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radicand (conjugate), we first need to identify the radicand of the given number. The radicand of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\).

Applying the formula, we get:

1. Compute \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Compute \( g \) of the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Thus, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we can express \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\) in terms of \(x\). Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\) and \(\tan(\theta) = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\cos(\theta)} = x\), we get:
\[
\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
We need to check if these solutions are valid. Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) are defined for all real \(x\), both solutions are valid.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations
\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel. Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors, which will give us the direction vector of the line connecting the two lines. Since the lines are parallel, the vector connecting any point on the first line to any point on the second line will be perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. We can use the vector connecting the points \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):
\[
\mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
We need to check if this vector is perpendicular to the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). We do this by computing the dot product:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = -8 \cdot 2 + 7 \cdot (-9) + 5 \cdot (-2) = -16 - 63 - 10 = -89.
\]
Since the dot product is not zero, the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) is not perpendicular to \(\mathbf{d}_1\). Therefore, we need to find the perpendicular distance from the point \(\mathbf{r}_2(0)\) to the line \(\mathbf{r}_1(t)\).

The formula for the distance from a point \(\mathbf{p}\) to a line given by \(\mathbf{r}(t) = \mathbf{a} + t \mathbf{b}\) is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\| (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|}.
\]
Here, \(\mathbf{p} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we compute \(\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}\):
\[
\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot (-2) - 5 \cdot (-9)) - \mathbf{j}((-8) \cdot (-2) - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}((-8) \cdot (-9) - 7 \cdot 2) = \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we compute the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]
Finally, we compute the distance:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{\| (\mathbf{p} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

   - The bottom boundary is \(y = -4\).
   - The top boundary is \(y = 4\).

2. **Determine the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values for points strictly inside the rectangle:**

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

\[

Combining these results, we have

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

- In the \(70\)'s, there are 12 Briefmarken, each priced at 12 cents.
- In the \(80\)'s, there are 9 Briefmarken, each priced at 8 cents.

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(CD\) is the height of the trapezoid, so \(CD = h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, in \(\triangle ACD\), the angle bisector \(\overline{AC}\) divides \(\overline{CD}\) into segments proportional to \(AD\) and \(CD\).

2. **Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
The total area of the schattierten region, which is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle, is:
\[
4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]
However, the problem states that the area of the schattierten region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the schattierten region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
This means that the area of the smaller circle that is not schattiert is:
\[
\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{3\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = -\frac{2\pi}{3}
\]
This calculation seems incorrect because the area cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the area of the schattiert region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, so the area of the schattiert region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The area of the smaller circle that is schattiert is:
\[

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical beakers and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the beaker's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting the value of \( r \) into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical beaker:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.

"To convert the speed of the car from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot.
2. Convert minutes to seconds. There are 60 seconds in a minute.

First, we start with the speed of the car in feet per minute, which is 20 feet per minute. We convert this to inches per minute by multiplying by 12:
\[ 20 \text{ feet/minute} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 240 \text{ inches/minute} \]

Next, we convert the speed from inches per minute to inches per second by dividing by 60:
\[ 240 \text{ inches/minute} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 4 \text{ inches/second} \]

Therefore, the speed of the car in inches per second is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the number of ways to form an unterdmite with 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion. Here are the steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the Republikaner:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 Republikaner is \( \binom{8}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

3. **Calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the Demokraten:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 Demokraten is \( \binom{6}{5} \):
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
   \]

4. **Use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one member is from each party:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 members such that at least one member is from each party is the total number of ways to choose 5 members minus the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the Republikaner and minus the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the Demokraten:
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we know that when the product is divided by the average of the three integers, the result is 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]
So, we can write:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = 24.\]
Since \(x+1 \neq 0\), we can cancel \(x+1\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[x(x+2) = 24.\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[x^2 + 2x = 24.\]
Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[x^2 + 2x - 24 = 0.\]
We can solve this quadratic equation by factoring. We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-24\) and add up to \(2\). These numbers are \(6\) and \(-4\). Therefore, we can write:
\[(x + 6)(x - 4) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero, we get:
\[x + 6 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 4 = 0.\]
So, the solutions are:
\[x = -6 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 4.\]
If \(x = -6\), then the three consecutive integers are \(-6\), \(-5\), and \(-4\). If \(x = 4\), then the three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\).

The greatest of these three integers is \(6\). Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(4096 = 64^2\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

In our case, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB} \]
\[ \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{AB} \]

Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDM \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[ \sin 3\theta = \frac{DM}{BM} = \frac{1}{BM} \]

We know that:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]

Substituting \( \sin \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \) into the equation, we get:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right) - 4 \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^3 = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{4 \cdot 1331}{AB^3} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{5324}{AB^3} \]

Since \( \sin 3\theta = \frac{1}{BM} \), we have:
\[ \frac{1}{BM} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{5324}{AB^3} \]

We also know that:
\[ \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{11}{AB} \right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{121}{AB^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}{AB} \]

Using the double angle identity for cosine, we have:
\[ \cos 2\theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}}{AB} \right)^2 - 1 = 2 \cdot \frac{AB^2 - 121}{AB^2} - 1 = \frac{2AB^2 - 242 - AB^2}{AB^2} = \frac{AB^2 - 242}{AB^2} \]

Since \( \cos 2\theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \), we have:
\[ \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{AB^2 - 242}{AB^2} \]
\[ BM = AB - \frac{242}{AB} \]

Substituting \( BM = AB - \frac{242}{AB} \) into the equation \( \sin 3\theta = \frac{1}{BM} \), we get:
\[ \frac{1}{AB - \frac{242}{AB}} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{5324}{AB^3} \]
\[ \frac{AB}{AB^2 - 242} = \frac{33}{AB} - \frac{5324}{AB^3} \]
\[ \frac{AB^4}{AB^2 - 242} = 33AB^2 - 5324 \]
\[ AB^4 = 33AB^4 - 5324AB^2 - 242AB^2 + 765688 \]
\[ AB^4 = 33AB^4 - 5566AB^2 + 765688 \]
\[ 0 = 32AB^4 - 5566AB^2 + 765688 \]
\[ 0 = 16AB^4 - 2783AB^2 + 382844 \]

Let \( x = AB^2 \). Then we have:
\[ 16x^2 - 2783x + 382844 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), we get:
\[ x = \frac{2783 \pm \sqrt{2783^2 - 4 \cdot 16 \cdot 382844}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{2783 \pm \sqrt{7740089 - 24408544}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{2783 \pm \sqrt{10000}}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{2783 \pm 100}{32} \]
\[ x = \frac{2883}{32} = 89 \]

So, \( AB^2 = 89 \) and \( AB = \sqrt{89} \).

Since \( AB = AC \) and \( BC = 2BM \), we have:
\[ BC = 2 \left( \sqrt{89} - \frac{242}{\sqrt{89}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{89 - 242}{\sqrt{89}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{-153}{\sqrt{89}} \right) = \frac{306}{\sqrt{89}} \]

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{89} + \frac{306}{\sqrt{89}} = \frac{178 + 306}{\sqrt{89}} = \frac{484}{\sqrt{89}} = 484 \]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that the sum is \(3^7\), so we set up the equation:

27 (a + 13) = 3^7

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), which is always greater than \(-4\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To solve this, we can make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So, the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3.\]
Recall that \(y = x^2\). Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,

\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),

s = 4.

"To determine for which class the number of male busfeners is closest to 135% of the number of female busfeners, we need to calculate the number of male and female busfeners in each class and then compare the ratios.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female busfeners in each class. Since there are 300 students in each grade, the number of male busfeners is 300 times the percentage of male busfeners, and the number of female busfeners is 300 times the percentage of female busfeners.

**9th Grade:**
- Male busfeners: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\)
- Female busfeners: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.041\)

- Female busfeners: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.039\)

**11th Grade:**
- Male busfeners: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\)
- Female busfeners: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.500\)

- Female busfeners: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), and the expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. From the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\), we get the critical points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). From the denominator \(x(x-36)\), we get the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10-9)(-10+9)|}{-10(-10-36)} = \frac{|(-19)(-1)|}{-10(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-\infty, -9)\).

2. For the interval \((-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1-9)(-1+9)|}{-1(-1-36)} = \frac{|(-10)(8)|}{-1(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-9, 0)\).

3. For the interval \((0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|(1-9)(1+9)|}{1(1-36)} = \frac{|(-8)(10)|}{1(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((0, 9)\).

4. For the interval \((9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|(10-9)(10+9)|}{10(10-36)} = \frac{|(1)(19)|}{10(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((9, 36)\).

5. For the interval \((36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|(37-9)(37+9)|}{37(37-36)} = \frac{|(28)(46)|}{37(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves. The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and it is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), the points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the inequality holds:

"To find the greatest possible area of the rectangular field, we need to consider the given information about the length of the Laufbahn, which consists of two sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the Laufbahn is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two sides of the rectangle are \( L \) and \( W \), and the two semicircles have a diameter equal to the width \( W \). The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi W \), so the total circumference of two semicircles is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the Laufbahn is the sum of the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles:
\[
L + W + \pi W = 400
\]
We can factor out \( W \) from the terms involving \( W \):
\[
L + W(1 + \pi) = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = 400 - W(1 + \pi)
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = W \left( 400 - W(1 + \pi) \right) = 400W - W^2(1 + \pi)
\]
This is a quadratic function in terms of \( W \), and it opens downwards (since the coefficient of \( W^2 \) is negative). The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -(1 + \pi) \) and \( b = 400 \), so the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area is:
\[
W = -\frac{400}{2(-(1 + \pi))} = \frac{400}{2(1 + \pi)} = \frac{200}{1 + \pi}
\]
Substituting this value of \( W \) back into the expression for \( L \), we get:
\[

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the angles \(R\) and \(T\) are complementary, meaning \(R + T = 90^\circ\). The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

Next, we need to find \(\cos{R}\). In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the adjacent side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). We know that \(RT = 5\) and \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(RS\). Therefore, we can find \(RS\) as follows:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{RS}{5} = \frac{2}{5} \implies RS = 2.
\]

Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(ST\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2 \implies 5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2 \implies 25 = 4 + ST^2 \implies ST^2 = 21 \implies ST = \sqrt{21}.
\]

Now, we can find \(\cos{R}\):
\[
\cos{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}.
\]

Since \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\), we have:
\[

"To find the smallest distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer other than 1, we find \(a + b\):

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is opposite to each other. The distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices in each pair are equal. Therefore, the given distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 must include the distances to three pairs of opposite vertices.

Let's denote the distances to the vertices of one pair as \( a \) and \( a \), and the distances to the vertices of the other pair as \( b \) and \( b \). The remaining distance \( c \) must be the distance to the sixth vertex. We need to determine which of the given distances corresponds to \( c \).

First, we list the given distances: 3, 7, 8, 9, 11. We need to find a combination of three distances that can be paired with the remaining two distances to form the sides of a regular octahedron. The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any interior point to opposite vertices is constant.

Let's check the possible combinations:
1. If \( c = 3 \), then the other three distances are 7, 8, and 9. We check if \( 3^2 + 9^2 = 7^2 + 8^2 \):

3. If \( c = 8 \), then the other three distances are 3, 7, and 9. We check if \( 8^2 + 9^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 \):

   This combination does not work.

"To determine the ratio of the accelerations of the Softball and the Baseball, we start with the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen and Jack are using the same force to throw their respective balls, we can set the force \( F \) equal for both the Softball and the Baseball. Let \( a_S \) be the acceleration of the Softball and \( a_B \) be the acceleration of the Baseball. The masses of the Softball and the Baseball are given as \( m_S = 200 \) g and \( m_B = 150 \) g, respectively. Using Newton's second law, we can write:

\[ F = m_S \cdot a_S \]
\[ F = m_B \cdot a_B \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the right-hand sides of these equations equal to each other:

\[ m_S \cdot a_S = m_B \cdot a_B \]

To find the ratio of the accelerations, we solve for \( \frac{a_S}{a_B} \):

\[ \frac{a_S}{a_B} = \frac{m_B}{m_S} \]

Substituting the given masses, we get:

\[ \frac{a_S}{a_B} = \frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

1. **Identify the number of Hexen and Zauberer:**
   - There are 6 Hexen.
   - There are 10 Zauberer.

2. **Handshakes between Hexen:**
   - Since all Hexen are good friends, each Hexen shakes hands with every other Hexen.
   - The number of handshakes among \( n \) people is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).
   - For 6 Hexen, the number of handshakes is:
     \[
     \binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2} = 15

3. **Handshakes between Zauberer:**
   - There is no information about the handshakes among the Zauberer, but we know that no Zauberer has shaken hands with another Zauberer.
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes among 10 Zauberer is 0.

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

From Vieta's formulas, we know that \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\).

Thus, we have:
\[
-(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = -4 - 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4).

Since \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\), we substitute this into the expression:
\[
-4 - 2(-2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)) = -4 + 4 + 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\), so \(a = kb\) since \(AB/AD = k\).

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any vertex. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\). Therefore, the point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\) if:

These lines divide the rectangle into four regions, each of which is a right triangle with the center \(O\) as one of its vertices. Each of these triangles has an area equal to one-fourth of the area of the rectangle. Therefore, the total area of the region where the point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the area of one of these triangles, which is one-fourth of the area of the rectangle.

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is \(2a \cdot 2b = 4ab\). The area of one of the triangles is:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \cdot 4ab = ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the region where the point is closer to \(O\) to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\) by dividing 54 by 6:
\[
q = \frac{54}{6} = 9
\]
Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:
\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54
\]
Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from 54:
\[
r = 54 - 54 = 0
\]
Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie exchanged their money in coins, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned in dollars.
2. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents.
3. Determine the number of each type of coin they have.
4. Calculate the total number of coins they have.
5. Determine how many coins they can exchange for a dollar.
6. Calculate the total number of coins they can exchange for a dollar.
7. Calculate the total amount of money they can exchange for a dollar.
8. Subtract the amount of money they can exchange for a dollar from the total amount of money they have.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they earned in dollars:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]
   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]
   So, the total amount of money they earned is $126.59.

2. Convert the total amount from dollars to cents:
   \[
   126.59 \text{ dollars} = 126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. Determine the number of each type of coin they have:
   - Linda: $27.47 = 2747$ cents
   - Sherry: $35.23 = 3523$ cents
   - June: $37.37 = 3737$ cents
   - Connie: $26.52 = 2652$ cents

4. Calculate the total number of coins they have:
   \[
   \text{Total number of coins} = 2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 = 12659
   \]

5. Determine how many coins they can exchange for a dollar:
   - Each dollar is 100 cents, so they can exchange 100 coins for a dollar.

6. Calculate the total number of coins they can exchange for a dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total number of coins they can exchange} = \left\lfloor \frac{12659}{100} \right\rfloor = 126 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of coins they can exchange} = 126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ coins}
   \]

7. Calculate the total amount of money they can exchange for a dollar:
   \[
   \text{Total amount of money they can exchange} = 126 \text{ dollars} \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}
   \]

8. Subtract the amount of money they can exchange for a dollar from the total amount of money they have:
   \[
   \text{Amount of money left} = 12659 - 12600 = 59 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money left, in cents, after they exchanged their coins is \(\boxed{59}\).","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the class average (arithmetic mean) for the test, we need to calculate the total points scored by all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total points scored by the students:
   - 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total points from these students is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
   - 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total points from these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total points from these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up all the points to get the total points for the class:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

3. Divide the total points by the number of students to get the average:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84

Therefore, the class average is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given magic square is valid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the square to be magic, this sum must also be equal to \( 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) works by substituting \( n = 7 \) into the magic square and checking the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

The magic square becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Let's check the sums:

- Sum of the first row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

- Sum of the first column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

- Sum of the main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Jim drives than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Martha drives. Martha drives along the length and the width of the field. The length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the total distance Martha drives is:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim drives. Jim drives diagonally across the field. The diagonal distance can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field). Therefore, the diagonal distance Jim drives is:
\[
\sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha drives and the distance Jim drives:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, Jim drives \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that starts at one point and visits all other points, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and determine the minimum total distance for each possible starting point. The points are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) with the following distances:
- \(AB = 6\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will calculate the total distance for each possible starting point and then find the minimum.

### Starting at Point \(D\)
The path is \(D \to A \to B \to C \to D\).
The total distance is:
\[DA + AB + BC + CD = 5 + 6 + 5 + 4 = 20\]

### Starting at Point \(A\)
The path is \(A \to D \to B \to C \to A\).
The total distance is:
\[AD + DB + BC + CA = 5 + 3 + 5 + 6 = 19\]

### Starting at Point \(B\)
The path is \(B \to C \to D \to A \to B\).
The total distance is:
\[BC + CD + DA + AB = 5 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20\]

### Starting at Point \(C\)
The path is \(C \to D \to A \to B \to C\).
The total distance is:
\[CD + DA + AB + BC = 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 = 20\]

From the above calculations, the shortest path is the one starting at point \(A\), which has a total distance of 19.
