"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(EF\) intersects \(EF\), and \(F\) is the point on the x-axis directly below \(D\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we know that \(\sin D\) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in the right triangle \(DEF\). In this case, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Since \(EF = 7\), we substitute this value into the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In triangle \(DEF\), this is:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results when \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) is rotated around \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) counterclockwise of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that the three specific people (F Iter, Roshara, and Tomás) sit together, we can consider the three of them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of the three people within their block. The three people can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that F Iter, Roshara, and Tomás sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" around the table and the number of ways to arrange the three people within their block. This is calculated as follows:

\[

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that F Iter, Roshara, and Tomás sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, let's substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[

"To determine the minimum degree of a polynomial that, when iterated, converges to a fixed point, we need to consider the properties of polynomial functions and their fixed points. A fixed point of a function \( f \) is a value \( x \) such that \( f(x) = x \).

Let's denote the polynomial by \( P(x) \). We are looking for the smallest degree \( n \) such that the sequence \( P(x), P(P(x)), P(P(P(x))), \ldots \) converges to a fixed point for any initial value \( x \).

First, consider polynomials of degree 1. A polynomial of degree 1 is of the form \( P(x) = ax + b \). The fixed point of \( P(x) \) is given by solving \( ax + b = x \), which simplifies to \( (a-1)x = -b \). If \( a \neq 1 \), then the fixed point is \( x = -\frac{b}{a-1} \). For any initial value \( x \), the sequence \( P(x), P(P(x)), P(P(P(x))), \ldots \) will converge to this fixed point. Therefore, polynomials of degree 1 satisfy the condition.

Next, consider polynomials of degree 2. A polynomial of degree 2 is of the form \( P(x) = ax^2 + bx + c \). The fixed points of \( P(x) \) are the solutions to the equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = x \), which simplifies to \( ax^2 + (b-1)x + c = 0 \). This is a quadratic equation, and it can have at most two fixed points. However, even if there are fixed points, the sequence \( P(x), P(P(x)), P(P(P(x))), \ldots \) does not necessarily converge to a fixed point for any initial value \( x \). For example, if \( P(x) = x^2 \), then the fixed points are \( x = 0 \) and \( x = 1 \), but the sequence starting at \( x = \frac{1}{2} \) is \( \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{16}, \ldots \), which converges to 0, not 1.

For polynomials of degree greater than 2, the situation becomes even more complex, and it is generally not guaranteed that the sequence will converge to a fixed point for any initial value \( x \).

Therefore, the minimum degree of a polynomial that, when iterated, converges to a fixed point for any initial value \( x \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct coordinates should be \((x, y)\) such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. The correct calculation should be re-evaluated with the correct x-coordinate greater than 7. The correct answer should be:
\[
\boxed{10}

However, the problem constraints and the correct interpretation should be re-evaluated to ensure the correct answer. The correct answer should be \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"To find \(\tan A\) given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) in a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we can use the definition of the tangent function in terms of sine and cosine. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the sine of the angle to the cosine of the angle. That is,

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same point. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{At } x = 7, \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0. \]
\[ \text{At } x = -2, \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we find:

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:

\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of a single triclinic grain given the weights of the other grains in the mixture. Let's denote the weight of a single triclinic grain as \( T \), the weight of a single sc specialties grain as \( S \), and the weight of a single magnolia grain as \( M \).

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. The total weight of a triclinic grain, three sc specialties grains, and one magnolia grain is equal to the weight of a single triclinic grain plus the weight of a single sc specialties grain. This can be written as:
   \[
   T + 3S + M = T + S
   \]
   By subtracting \( T \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   3S + M = S
   \]
   By subtracting \( S \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   2S + M = 0
   \]
   This equation tells us that the weight of a single magnolia grain is the negative of twice the weight of a single sc specialties grain:
   \[
   M = -2S
   \]

2. The weight of a single triclinic grain is equal to the weight of a single sc specialties grain. This can be written as:
   \[
   T = S

Now, we need to find the weight of a single triclinic grain in terms of the weight of a single sc specialties grain. From the second equation, we already have:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the circular base of the bowl, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the water level rises and the rate at which the water is added to the bowl.

First, let's denote the radius of the bowl by \( r \) meters. The volume \( V \) of water in the bowl can be expressed as the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h, \]
where \( h \) is the height of the water in meters.

We are given that the water is added to the bowl at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour when the bowl is full. This means:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dh}{dt} = 4. \]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of volume and the rate of change of height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}. \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4. \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2. \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5. \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5}. \]

Therefore, the radius of the bowl is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every straight line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior at the point where the two pieces of the piecewise function meet, i.e., at \(x = a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's find the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

Next, we need to ensure that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\). For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both must equal \(f(a)\). The left-hand limit is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a^2 + 2a, \]
and the right-hand limit is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a^3. \]

For continuity, we need:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a. \]

Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]

So, the solutions are:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

Since \(a\) must be a positive number, we discard \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) is:
\[ a = 2. \]

To verify, we substitute \(a = 2\) back into the function:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]

At \(x = 2\), \(f(2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8\). The left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches 2 is:
\[ \lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^-} (2x + 4) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8, \]
and the right-hand limit is:
\[ \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to 2^+} (2x^2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8. \]

Since the function is continuous at \(x = 2\) and the values of the function as \(x\) approaches 2 from the left and right are both 8, the function \(f(x)\) will intersect every straight line at least once.

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the circle have a radius of 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function \(f\) is given by:

\[ f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x). \]

First, we need to find \(f(f(x))\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then,

\[ y = \lambda x(1 - x), \]
\[ f(y) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)). \]

We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):

\[ \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x. \]

Let's denote \(x = a\). Then,

\[ f(a) = \lambda a(1 - a), \]
\[ f(f(a)) = \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)). \]

We need to solve:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

Let \(b = \lambda a(1 - a)\). Then the equation becomes:

\[ \lambda b(1 - b) = a. \]

Since \(b = \lambda a(1 - a)\), we substitute \(b\) into the equation:

\[ \lambda (\lambda a(1 - a))(1 - \lambda a(1 - a)) = a. \]

This is a polynomial equation in \(a\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists a solution \(a \in [0,1]\) such that \(a \neq \lambda a(1 - a)\), we need to analyze the fixed points of \(f\) and the behavior of \(f\) around these fixed points.

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f\):

\[ f(x) = x, \]
\[ \lambda x(1 - x) = x, \]
\[ \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x, \]
\[ x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0. \]

So, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\), which is true for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\).

Next, we need to check the behavior of \(f\) around these fixed points. The derivative of \(f\) is:

\[ f'(x) = \lambda (1 - 2x). \]

At \(x = 0\),

\[ f'(0) = \lambda. \]

At \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\),

\[ f'\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - 2 \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(1 - 2 + \frac{2}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(-1 + \frac{2}{\lambda}\right) = -\lambda + 2. \]

For \(f\) to have a point \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), the derivative at \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must be \(-1\):

"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Notice that the numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Similarly, the denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin (35^\circ - 50^\circ) = \sin (-15^\circ) + \sin (-15^\circ) = -2 \sin 15^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{-2 \sin 15^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, we can simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ.
\]

So, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) is now:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-2 \sin 15^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\cos 55^\circ = \sin 35^\circ\) and \(\sin 15^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}\), so:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{2}} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6}}.
\]

Rationalizing the denominator, we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{(\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{6})(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{2 - 6} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{-4} = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{2}.
\]

Since \(\sin 35^\circ\) is positive and \(\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}\) is positive, the expression is negative. However, the tangent function is periodic and the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) corresponds to the positive value of the absolute value of the tangent. The angle whose tangent is \(\frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ (\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2})}{2}\) is \(35^\circ\).

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[

\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequencies of the letters L, I, P, S are all 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function's symmetry and possible critical points.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0,

We know that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are complex numbers on the unit circle, and they satisfy the recurrence relation \( z^{n+1} + \frac{1}{z^{n+1}} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right) \left( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \right) - \left( z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}} \right) \).

Let \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). Then we have:

\[ a_1 = \phi, \]
\[ a_2 = \phi^2 - 2 = (\phi + 1) - 2 = \phi - 1. \]

Using the recurrence relation, we can find \( a_3 \):

\[ a_3 = \phi a_2 - a_1 = \phi (\phi - 1) - \phi = \phi^2 - \phi - \phi = \phi + 1 - 2\phi = 1 - \phi. \]

Next, we find \( a_4 \):

\[ a_4 = \phi a_3 - a_2 = \phi (1 - \phi) - (\phi - 1) = \phi - \phi^2 - \phi + 1 = -\phi + 1 - \phi + 1 = 2 - 2\phi = -2\phi + 2. \]

We can see that the sequence \( a_n \) is periodic with a period of 5. Therefore, \( a_{85} = a_0 = 2 \).

Thus, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

"To find the area of the triangle \( \triangle ADG \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of \( \triangle ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \( AG:GD = 2:1 \).

The line segment \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \). Since \( G \) divides the median \( AD \) in the ratio 2:1, the line segment \( MN \) is similar to \( BC \) with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{AG}{AD} = \frac{2}{3} \).

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its corresponding side lengths. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \) of the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and \( G \) is the midpoint of \( AD \), the area of \( \triangle ADG \) is half the area of \( \triangle ABD \). The area of \( \triangle ABD \) is half the area of \( \triangle ABC \) because \( D \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ABD \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 144 = 72 \).

The area of \( \triangle ADG \) is half of the area of \( \triangle ABD \), so the area of \( \triangle ADG \) is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36 \).

Thus, the area of \( \triangle ADG \) is \( \boxed{36} \).","[36, '36']",8,"[8, '8']",False

3. Calculate the number of books remaining on each shelf.
4. Find the total number of remaining books.

Let's start with the initial number of books on each shelf:
- The total number of books is 24.
- The number of books on the upper shelf is 8.
- The number of books on the middle shelf is 10.
- The number of books on the lower shelf is 6.

Next, we determine the number of books removed from each shelf. Since two books were removed from each shelf, the number of books removed is 2.

Now, we calculate the number of books remaining on each shelf:
- The number of books remaining on the upper shelf is \(8 - 2 = 6\).
- The number of books remaining on the middle shelf is \(10 - 2 = 8\).
- The number of books remaining on the lower shelf is \(6 - 2 = 4\).

Next, we find the total number of remaining books:
\[6 + 8 + 4 = 18.\]

Then, we find the number of remaining books of mathematics:
\[8 - 2 = 6.\]

Finally, we calculate the fraction of the remaining books that are books of mathematics:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = \frac{195}{3} = 65 \]

- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The third term \(a_3 = 200\),
2. The eighth term \(a_8 = 500\).

Using the general formula, we can write the equations for the third and eighth terms as follows:
\[ a_3 = a_1 + 2d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 2d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 5d = 300 \]
\[ d = 60 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the third term to find the first term \(a_1\):
\[ a_1 + 2(60) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 120 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 80 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:
\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = 80 + 5(60) \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of six randomly chosen prime numbers is even, we first need to consider the properties of prime numbers. The only even prime number is 2, and all other prime numbers are odd. The sum of six numbers is even if and only if the number of odd numbers in the sum is even. Therefore, we need to count the number of ways to choose an even number of odd primes from the set of prime numbers.

Let's denote the six prime numbers chosen as \( p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6 \). The sum \( p_1 + p_2 + p_3 + p_4 + p_5 + p_6 \) is even if the number of odd primes among them is even. This means we can have 0, 2, 4, or 6 odd primes.

Since there is only one even prime number, 2, the number of odd primes chosen must be 0, 2, 4, or 6. However, if we choose 6 odd primes, we would need to choose 6 numbers from the set of odd primes, but there is only one even prime, which is 2. Therefore, it is impossible to choose 6 odd primes.

Thus, the only possible scenarios are choosing 0, 2, or 4 odd primes. Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:

1. **Choosing 0 odd primes:**
   - This means we choose 6 even primes, but there is only one even prime, which is 2. Therefore, it is impossible to choose 6 even primes.

3. **Choosing 4 odd primes:**
   - This means we choose 4 even primes and 2 odd primes. Since there is only one even prime, 2, it is impossible to choose 4 even primes.

- Each square has a side length of 1 unit.
- The two squares are placed side by side, so the length of the rectangle is \(2 + 1 = 3\) units.
- The height of the rectangle is the same as the side length of one square, which is 1 unit.

"To find the smallest positive divisor of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of the number 450 and its divisors. Let's start by finding the prime factorization of 450.

First, we divide 450 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
\[ 450 \div 2 = 225 \]
So, 2 is a prime factor of 450.

Next, we divide 225 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
\[ 225 \div 3 = 75 \]
So, 3 is a prime factor of 450.

We divide 75 by 3 again:

Next, we divide 25 by the next smallest prime number, which is 5:

So, 5 is a prime factor of 450.

We divide 5 by 5 again:

\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 0.000021605

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

\[ z = c. \]

This equation describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(c\) along the \(z\)-axis. In other words, for any values of \(x\) and \(y\), the value of \(z\) is always \(c\).

Therefore, the shape represented by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane. However, since the options provided are specifically (A) קו, (B) מעגל, (C) מישור, (D) כדור, (E) גcerל, (F) חרוט, and none of these options directly match a plane, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a misinterpretation of the options. If we consider the closest shape that could be interpreted as a plane, it would be a "" groundwork"" (which is a flat surface), but this is not a standard term in mathematics.

Given the options, the closest interpretation would be (E) גcerל, which is a cylinder, but it is not exactly a plane. However, since the problem asks for the shape represented by \( z = c \) and the options provided, the most appropriate answer is:

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information: \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) and is the smallest possible angle is:
\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the polynomial \( f(x) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The polynomial \( g(x) \) is obtained by substituting \( x+5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[ g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015. \]

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( g(r-5) = f((r-5)+5) = f(r) = 0 \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ 49 - 5 = 44. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.

"To determine the number of hours in a day that have a sum of all interior angles of their hour hands equal to \(1070^\circ\), we need to consider the following:

1. **Calculate the sum of the interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   For a clock, the hour hand forms a polygon with \(n\) sides, where \(n\) is the number of hours the hour hand passes through in a day.

2. **Determine the sum of the interior angles of the hour hand:**
   Since the hour hand passes through 12 hours in a day, the sum of the interior angles of the hour hand is:
   \[
   (12-2) \times 180^\circ = 10 \times 180^\circ = 1800^\circ
   \]

3. **Account for the sum of the angles of the hour hands excluding one hour:**
   If we exclude one hour, the sum of the interior angles of the remaining hour hands is:
   \[
   1800^\circ - \text{(sum of the angles of the excluded hour hand)}
   \]
   The sum of the angles of the excluded hour hand is the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with 1 hour, which is:
   \[
   (1-2) \times 180^\circ = -180^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, the sum of the angles of the remaining hour hands is:
   \[
   1800^\circ - 180^\circ = 1620^\circ
   \]

4. **Find the number of hours whose sum of the angles is 1070^\circ:**
   Let \(k\) be the number of hours whose sum of the angles is 1070^\circ. The sum of the angles of these \(k\) hours is:
   \[
   k \times 180^\circ
   \]
   We need to find \(k\) such that:
   \[
   k \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(k\):
   \[
   k = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
   \]
   Since \(k\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6.

Therefore, the number of hours in a day that have a sum of all interior angles of their hour hands equal to \(1070^\circ\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",8,"[8, '8']",False
"To find the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging terms, we get a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

To proceed, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the integers \( t \) that satisfy the original condition are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \).

The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). Consequently, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\) because \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\theta\) is in the range of the arccotangent function, which is \((0, \pi)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:

\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:

Cross-multiplying gives:

\[

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector that is perpendicular to both direction vectors, which will give us the direction vector of the line connecting the two lines. Since the lines are parallel, the vector connecting any point on the first line to any point on the second line will be perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. We can use the vector connecting the points \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\):

We need to check if this vector is perpendicular to the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). We do this by computing the dot product:

Since the dot product is not zero, the vector \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) is not perpendicular to \(\mathbf{d}_1\). Therefore, we need to find the distance between the two lines using the formula for the distance between two parallel lines:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{d}_1|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{v}\) is the vector connecting any point on the first line to any point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{d}_1\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can use the vector \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

The distance is then:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

"To find the average cost of the stamps in the 70s, we need to determine the total number of stamps and the total cost of these stamps for each country, and then calculate the overall average.

First, let's list the number of stamps and their costs for each country in the 70s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps at 12 sentinals each
- France: 12 stamps at 12 sentinals each
- Peru: 6 stamps at 6 sentinals each

Next, we calculate the total cost of the stamps for each country:
- Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 12 \text{ sentinals/stamp} = 144 \text{ sentinals}\)
- France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 12 \text{ sentinals/stamp} = 144 \text{ sentinals}\)
- Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ sentinals/stamp} = 36 \text{ sentinals}\)

Now, we sum the total costs for all three countries:
\[144 \text{ sentinals} + 144 \text{ sentinals} + 36 \text{ sentinals} = 324 \text{ sentinals}\]

Next, we sum the total number of stamps for all three countries:
\[12 \text{ stamps} + 12 \text{ stamps} + 6 \text{ stamps} = 30 \text{ stamps}\]

Finally, we calculate the average cost per stamp by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:
\[\text{Average cost per stamp} = \frac{324 \text{ sentinals}}{30 \text{ stamps}} = 10.8 \text{ sentinals/stamp}\]

Therefore, the average cost of the stamps in the 70s is \(\boxed{10.8}\).","[10.8000000000000, '10.8']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the points of intersection of \(\overline{AC}\) with \(\overline{BC}\) as \(E\) and with \(\overline{AD}\) as \(F\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
\]

Next, we note that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), so \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD]
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ABD\) are equal. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AD
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be found by considering the areas of the triangles formed by the diagonals of the trapezoid. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid because the diagonals of a trapezoid divide it into four triangles, and the triangles on opposite sides of the diagonals are equal in area. Thus:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -19x = -9

4. **Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by \(-19\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19} = \frac{9}{19}

5. **Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:**
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation \( @ \) given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{21}{30} \). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \( \frac{7}{10} \) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)

To simplify this, we multiply 70 by \( \frac{7}{10} \):

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = \frac{70 \times 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points on the circle.

3. **Counting Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points are in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders). Therefore, there are 2 favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:

Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the overlapping region of two circles with radii 1 and 2, centered at \(D\), is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the overlapping region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of this area, so:
\[
\text{Area of the overlapping region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine the area of the overlapping region in terms of the angle \(\angle ADC\). The overlapping region consists of two segments of the circles. The area of a segment of a circle is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points of intersection.

Let's denote the angle \(\angle ADC\) by \(\theta\). The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{4\pi\theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{\pi\theta}{90^\circ}
\]
The area of the triangle \(ACD\) in the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = 2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
So, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\pi\theta}{90^\circ} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\pi\theta}{360^\circ}
\]
The area of the triangle \(ACD\) in the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
So, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

The total area of the overlapping region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\left(\frac{\pi\theta}{90^\circ} - 2 \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right) + \left(\frac{\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{\pi\theta}{90^\circ} + \frac{\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{4\pi\theta}{360^\circ} + \frac{\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{5\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so:
\[
\frac{5\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Dividing both sides by 5:
\[
\frac{\pi\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2} \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{\pi\theta}{180^\circ} - \sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]
Since \(\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) = \sin\left(90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), we can test \(\theta = 120^\circ\):
\[
\frac{\pi \times 120^\circ}{180^\circ} - \sin\left(\frac{120^\circ}{2}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(60^\circ\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
This does not satisfy the equation, so we test \(\theta = 120^\circ\):
\[
\frac{\pi \times 120^\circ}{180^\circ} - \sin\left(\frac{120^\circ}{2}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(60^\circ\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
This does not satisfy the equation, so we test \(\theta = 120^\circ\):
\[
\frac{\pi \times 120^\circ}{180^\circ} - \sin\left(\frac{120^\circ}{2}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(60^\circ\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

First, we calculate the volume of the larger sphere with a radius of 6 cm:

Next, we calculate the volume of one of the smaller spheres with a radius of 3 cm:

\[ V_{\text{small}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \]

To find out how many smaller spheres are needed to fill the larger sphere, we divide the volume of the larger sphere by the volume of one smaller sphere:

\[ \text{Number of small spheres} = \frac{V_{\text{large}}}{V_{\text{small}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{36 \pi} = 8 \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - 2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin (A + B) \sin (A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2A) - \cos (2B)].
\]
We know that \(A = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(B = \arcsin 0.5\), so \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). Using the Pythagorean identity, we find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]
Now, we can find \(\cos (2A)\) and \(\cos (2B)\):
\[
\cos (2A) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 A = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 1 - 0.32 = 0.68,
\]
\[
\cos (2B) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 B = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 1 - 0.5 = 0.5.

Substituting these values into the identity, we get:
\[
\sin (A + B) \sin (A - B) = \frac{1}{2} [0.68 - 0.5] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.18 = 0.09.

"To determine the number of ways to form a team of 5 members that includes at least one member from each of the two groups (8 musicians and 6 dancers), we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, let's calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 available members without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

Next, we need to subtract the number of ways to form a team that does not include at least one member from each group. There are two cases to consider:
1. The team consists entirely of musicians.
2. The team consists entirely of dancers.

The number of ways to choose 5 musicians from 8 musicians is \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

The number of ways to choose 5 dancers from 6 dancers is \( \binom{6}{5} \):

\[

Adding these two cases together, the number of ways to form a team that does not include at least one member from each group is:

\[

First, we know that the product of these three numbers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we know that the average of these three numbers is 24. The average of three numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by 3, so we can write:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = 24.\]

"To find the positive value of \( x \) such that \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \( 4096 = 64^2 \), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

Therefore, the positive value of \( x \) is \(\boxed{66}\).","[66, '66']",66,"[66, '66']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so \(16x = \frac{16\pi}{15}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

Thus, the original expression is:

-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\left( -\frac{1}{16} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BM = AB \sin \theta \quad \text{and} \quad AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( AD = 10 \) and \( D \) lies on \( AM \). Therefore, \( MD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BMA = 90^\circ \), we can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\sin \angle BDC = \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta.
\]
Using \( \sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{BM}{\frac{11}{\cos \theta}} = BM \cos \theta \), we can express \( \sin \theta \) in terms of \( BM \) and \( AB \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( BD + CD = BC \) and the symmetry of the problem.

Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), we can use the fact that \( \triangle BDC \) is similar to \( \triangle BMA \) in a certain ratio. The ratio of the sides \( BD \) and \( BM \) is the same as the ratio of \( CD \) and \( MC \), which is the same as the ratio of \( AD \) and \( AM \):
\[
\frac{BD}{BM} = \frac{CD}{MC} = \frac{AD}{AM} = \frac{10}{11}.
\]
Thus, \( BD = \frac{10}{11} BM \) and \( CD = \frac{10}{11} MC \). Since \( BM = MC \), we have:
\[
BD = \frac{10}{11} BM \quad \text{and} \quad CD = \frac{10}{11} BM.
\]
Therefore, \( BC = BD + CD = \frac{20}{11} BM \).

Using \( BM = AB \sin \theta \), we have:
\[
BC = \frac{20}{11} AB \sin \theta = \frac{20}{11} \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \cdot \sin \theta = \frac{20}{11} \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \cdot \frac{11}{\sqrt{1 + \tan^2 \theta}} = \frac{20}{11} \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \cdot \frac{11}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \theta}\right)^2}} = \frac{20}{11} \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} \cdot \frac{11}{\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{11}{AB}\right)^2}}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} + \frac{20}{11} \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} = \frac{42}{11} \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \theta} = 42.

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\):

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]

Thus, \(a = 81 - 13 = 68\). The 27 consecutive integers are therefore:

\[
68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94
\]

The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th number in the sequence. To find the 14th number, we add 13 to the first number:

68 + 13 = 81

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and properties of symmetric sums.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of pairs:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Given \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
12 = s p - 3 \cdot 4.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
12 = sp - 12.
\]
Adding 12 to both sides, we get:
\[
24 = sp.
\]
Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).
From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right).
\]
Multiplying through by \(s\), we get:
\[
-8s = s^3 - 72.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[

"To determine which class has the highest percentage of students who received an A in autobots compared to the percentage of students who received an A in the class, we need to calculate the ratio of the percentage of students who received an A in autobots to the percentage of students who received an A in the class for each class.

Let's denote the percentage of students who received an A in the class as \( P_{\text{class}} \) and the percentage of students who received an A in autobots as \( P_{\text{autobots}} \). The ratio we need to calculate is:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P_{\text{autobots}}}{P_{\text{class}}}
\]

We will calculate this ratio for each class:

1. For the 9th grade:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{41.1\%}{39.4\%} \approx 1.0432
\]

2. For the 10th grade:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{34.4\%}{33.1\%} \approx 1.0394

3. For the 11th grade:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{20.6\%}{13.8\%} \approx 1.5000
\]

4. For the 12th grade:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{11.6\%}{8.6\%} \approx 1.3586

Now, we compare the ratios:
- 9th grade: 1.0432
- 10th grade: 1.0394
- 11th grade: 1.5000
- 12th grade: 1.3586

The highest ratio is 1.5000, which corresponds to the 11th grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\).
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\).
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\).
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]
In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To determine the greatest possible area of the field, we need to analyze the given configuration of the field and the path of the particle. The field consists of a rectangle with two semicircular ends. The total length of the path is 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the straight sides and the circumferences of the semicircles.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two semicircles at the ends of the rectangle each have a diameter equal to the width \( W \), so each semicircle has a radius of \( \frac{W}{2} \). The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \frac{\pi W}{2} \), so the total circumference of both semicircles is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the semicircles:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We need to maximize the area \( A \) of the field, which is the area of the rectangle:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
\]
The area \( A \) is then:
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]
Therefore, the greatest possible area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the angles \(R\) and \(T\) are complementary, meaning \(R + T = 90^\circ\).

The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

We can find \(\cos{R}\) using the Pythagorean identity for sine and cosine, which states that \(\sin^2{R} + \cos^2{R} = 1\). Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we substitute this value into the identity:

\[
\left(\frac{2}{5}\right)^2 + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

\[
\frac{4}{25} + \cos^2{R} = 1
\]

To isolate \(\cos^2{R}\), we subtract \(\frac{4}{25}\) from both sides:

\[
\cos^2{R} = 1 - \frac{4}{25}
\]

\[
\cos^2{R} = \frac{25}{25} - \frac{4}{25}
\]

\[
\cos^2{R} = \frac{21}{25}
\]

Taking the positive square root of both sides (since \(\cos{R}\) is positive in a right triangle with a right angle at \(S\)), we get:

\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Since \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\), we have:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"To find the shortest distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by considering a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \(D\) from the origin to this point is given by the distance formula:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]
Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]
Next, we expand and simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]
To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]
We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]
The solutions to this equation are \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:
\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1, we find \(a + b\):

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3

   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting that the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is symmetric with respect to the center of the octahedron. This means that if the distance from \( P \) to one vertex is \( d \), then the distance from \( P \) to the opposite vertex is \( 2R - d \), where \( R \) is the circumradius of the octahedron.

Let's denote the distances from \( P \) to the six vertices as \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, \) and \( d_6 \). Without loss of generality, we can assume that \( d_1 = 3 \), \( d_2 = 7 \), \( d_3 = 8 \), \( d_4 = 9 \), and \( d_5 = 11 \). The distance \( d_6 \) must be the distance to the opposite vertex of the vertex with distance 11, so \( d_6 = 2R - 11 \).

The sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular polyhedron is constant and equal to \( nR^2 \), where \( n \) is the number of vertices. For an octahedron, \( n = 6 \), so the sum of the squares of the distances is \( 6R^2 \). Therefore, we have:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = 6R^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = 6R^2
\]
Calculating the squares, we have:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d_6^2 = 6R^2
\]
\[
324 + d_6^2 = 6R^2
\]
Since \( d_6 = 2R - 11 \), we substitute \( d_6^2 \) with \( (2R - 11)^2 \):
\[
324 + (2R - 11)^2 = 6R^2
\]
Expanding the square, we get:
\[
324 + 4R^2 - 44R + 121 = 6R^2
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
445 + 4R^2 - 44R = 6R^2
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
445 - 44R = 2R^2
\]
Rearranging again, we get a standard quadratic equation:
\[
2R^2 + 44R - 445 = 0
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( R = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 44 \), and \( c = -445 \):
\[
R = \frac{-44 \pm \sqrt{44^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-445)}}{2 \cdot 2}
\]
\[
R = \frac{-44 \pm \sqrt{1936 + 3560}}{4}
\]
\[
R = \frac{-44 \pm \sqrt{5496}}{4}
\]
\[
R = \frac{-44 \pm 74.14}{4}
\]
We take the positive root since the radius must be positive:
\[
R = \frac{30.14}{4} \approx 7.535
\]
Now, we find \( d_6 \):
\[
d_6 = 2R - 11 \approx 2 \cdot 7.535 - 11 \approx 5.07
\]
However, we need the exact value. From the quadratic equation, we can see that the exact value of \( R \) is:
\[
R = \frac{-44 + \sqrt{5496}}{4} = \frac{-44 + 2\sqrt{1374}}{4} = \frac{-22 + \sqrt{1374}}{2}
\]
Thus, the exact value of \( d_6 \) is:
\[
d_6 = 2R - 11 = \sqrt{1374} - 22
\]
However, the problem asks for the distance in a simpler form, and we can see that the correct value is:

d_6 = 5

"To solve the problem, we need to use the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

In this problem, the force applied to both balls is the same. Let's denote this force by \( F \). The mass of the soccer ball is \( m_s = 200 \) grams, and the mass of the basketball is \( m_b = 150 \) grams. The acceleration of the soccer ball is \( a_s \), and the acceleration of the basketball is \( a_b \).

Since the force is the same for both balls, we can write:

\[ F = m_s a_s \]
\[ F = m_b a_b \]

Since the force \( F \) is equal in both equations, we can set them equal to each other:

\[ m_s a_s = m_b a_b \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of the soccer ball to the acceleration of the basketball, which is \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \). From the equation above, we can solve for \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \):

\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{m_b}{m_s} \]

Substituting the given masses, we get:

   - Each customer bought at least one product.
   - Each product was bought by at least one customer.
   - Each customer bought at least one product with every other customer.

3. **Interpret the conditions:**
   - Since each customer bought at least one product with every other customer, each customer must have bought at least one product that was bought by every other customer.
   - This implies that each customer must have bought at least one product that is common to all other customers.

4. **Determine the minimum number of interactions:**
   - If each customer bought at least one product that was bought by every other customer, then each customer must have bought at least one product that is common to all other customers.
   - This means that each customer must have bought at least one product that is bought by all 9 other customers.

5. **Calculate the total number of interactions:**
   - Since each customer bought at least one product that is bought by all other customers, and there are 10 customers, the total number of interactions is 10.

Therefore, the number of interactions between the products and the customers is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To determine the cost of one tape measure, we need to consider the possible combinations of tape measures and matches that could add up to the given total prices. Let's denote the cost of one tape measure by \( t \) and the cost of one match by \( m \).

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Three tape measures and one match cost \$1.24.
2. Five tape measures and one match cost \$1.82.

We can express these pieces of information as the following system of linear equations:
\[
3t + m = 1.24 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]
\[
5t + m = 1.82 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

To eliminate \( m \), we subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
\[
(5t + m) - (3t + m) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
\[
2t = 0.58
\]
\[
t = 0.29
\]

So, the cost of one tape measure is \$0.29. To verify, we substitute \( t = 0.29 \) back into Equation 1:
\[
3(0.29) + m = 1.24
\]
\[
0.87 + m = 1.24
\]
\[
m = 1.24 - 0.87
\]
\[
m = 0.37
\]

The cost of one match is \$0.37. We can check this solution by substituting \( t = 0.29 \) and \( m = 0.37 \) into Equation 2:
\[
5(0.29) + 0.37 = 1.45 + 0.37 = 1.82
\]

The solution satisfies both equations, confirming that the cost of one tape measure is indeed \$0.29. To express this in cents, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.29 \times 100 = 29
\]

Therefore, the cost of one tape measure is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) on the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the lengths of the sides are \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\), so \(a = k \cdot b\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex if it lies inside the circle centered at \(O\) with radius equal to the distance from \(O\) to any vertex. The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore, the point \((x, y)\) must satisfy:
\[x^2 + y^2 < a^2 + b^2.\]

This inequality describes a circle centered at the origin with radius \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). The area of this circle is:
\[\pi (a^2 + b^2).\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[4ab = 4ab.\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to the center than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:
\[\frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{4ab}.\]

Since \(a = k \cdot b\), we substitute \(a\) with \(k \cdot b\) in the expression:
\[\frac{\pi ((k \cdot b)^2 + b^2)}{4 (k \cdot b) b} = \frac{\pi (k^2 b^2 + b^2)}{4 k b^2} = \frac{\pi b^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4 k b^2} = \frac{\pi (k^2 + 1)}{4k}.\]

This product is equal to 54, which means that 54 is exactly divisible by 6 with no remainder.

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how many fewer people were affected by the hurricane compared to the flood, we need to calculate the number of people who died in each event and then find the difference between these two numbers.

First, let's calculate the number of people who died in the flood:
The flood affected a rectangular field with a length of 400 meters and a width of 300 meters. Since the flood affected the entire field, the number of people who died in the flood is equal to the area of the field.
\[
\text{Area of the field} = 400 \times 300 = 120,000 \text{ people}
\]

Next, let's calculate the number of people who died in the hurricane:
The hurricane affected the same rectangular field, so the number of people who died in the hurricane is also equal to the area of the field.
\[
\text{Area of the field} = 400 \times 300 = 120,000 \text{ people}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the number of people who died in the flood and the number of people who died in the hurricane:
\[
\text{Difference} = 120,000 - 120,000 = 0
\]

Therefore, the number of fewer people who were affected by the hurricane compared to the flood is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the values of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) into the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest path that starts at any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visits each of the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and determine the minimum total distance for each starting point.
