"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(E\) is the point where the vertical line from \(D\) to \(F\) intersects the vertical line from \(F\) to \(E\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units, and the length of \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(DF\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF
\]
Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10 units, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In this case, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\) gives:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the squares gives:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides gives:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides gives:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i \frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]
   Since \( i^2 = -1 \), we have:
   \[
   z'' = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Here, we have 3 distinct names, so we need to find \( 3! \):

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) in the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) where \(x > 7\), we need to use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must also be \((6, \frac{7}{2})\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. This means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the point \((x, y)\) is not on the same line as the other points but forms a parallelogram with the given points.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct point \((x, y)\) should be such that the diagonals bisect each other. The correct calculation should be:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Since \(x > 7\), the correct interpretation should be that the point \((x, y)\) is not on the same line as the other points but forms a parallelogram with the given points. The correct point \((x, y)\) should be such that the diagonals bisect each other. The correct calculation should be:

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to find both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

First, we factor the quadratic expression:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the polynomial in the numerator and the polynomial in the denominator. The numerator is \( 2x \), which is a polynomial of degree 1, and the denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \), which is a polynomial of degree 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in a memorable way, we can use a clever algebraic manipulation. Let's start by expressing the given expression in a form that allows us to use the identity for the sum of a geometric series.

First, notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1.\]

We can rewrite \(99\) as \(100 - 1\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100 - 1)^2 + (100 - 1) + 1.\]

Next, we expand \((100 - 1)^2\):
\[(100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801.\]

Now, substitute this back into the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + (100 - 1) + 1 = 9801 + 100 - 1 + 1 = 9801 + 100 = 9901.\]

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 1 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 16 \). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all 2-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to obtain:

Thus, we have:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that the cotangent of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the tangent of \(x\), and \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified expression is:

\[
\cot x.

2. Two trumps and one charm have the same weight as one spell. This can be written as:

Subtract \( T \) from both sides:

We can substitute the expression for \( S \) from the second equation into the first equation. From the second equation, we have:
\[
S = 2T + C

Substitute \( S \) in the first equation:
\[
(2T + C) + C = 2T

Combine like terms:
\[

\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
3b = 6
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
b = 2
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
Simplify:
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4a = -12
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
a = -3
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16
\]
Simplify:
\[
-10 - 6 = -16
\]
\[
-16 = -16
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

By comparing the constant terms, we get:
\[

\]
Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[

\[

This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the given information about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level is rising.

First, let's denote the radius of the tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the water in the tank by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of water in the tank is given by the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h. \]

We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per unit time, and that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per unit time. This means:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dh}{dt} = 4. \]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}. \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4. \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2. \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5. \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5}. \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is \(\boxed{\sqrt{5}}\) meters.","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise and ensure that there are no gaps in the range of \(f(x)\).

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of \(f(x)\) on each interval.

1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). The range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) must include the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \quad \text{if } a > 0, \]
and
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3 \quad \text{if } a < 0. \]

Let's solve these inequalities.

For \(a > 0\):
\[ a^2 + 2a \geq a^3 \implies a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the polynomial are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the interval \((0, 2]\). Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(0 < a \leq 2\).

For \(a < 0\):
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3 \implies a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]
The roots of the polynomial are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the interval \([-1, 0)\). Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) holds for \(-1 \leq a < 0\).

Combining both intervals, we get:
\[ -1 \leq a \leq 2. \]

The maximum value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To find the value of \( c \) in the equation of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \( r \) is the radius of the circle.

Given that the radius \( r \) is 1, the standard form becomes \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 1\).

We start with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0. \]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms.

For the \( x \)-terms, \( x^2 - 10x \), we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25. \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25. \]

For the \( y \)-terms, \( y^2 + 6y \), we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). We add and subtract this square inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9. \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9. \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0. \]

Next, we combine the constant terms on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0. \]

To isolate the completed squares, we move the constant term \(-34 + c\) to the right side of the equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c. \]

Since this equation must be in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 1\), we set the right side equal to 1:
\[ 34 - c = 1. \]

Now, we solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - 1 = c, \]
\[ c = 33. \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is also satisfied for \(\lambda \ge 1\). Therefore, the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) exists if and only if \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Simplifying the left-hand side, we have:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Since \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) to this equation, the discriminant of the quadratic equation in \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) must be non-negative. However, a simpler approach is to test the boundary values of \(\lambda\). If \(\lambda = 4\), then:
\[
f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2.
\]
The fixed points are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{4 - 1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{3}{4}\), we have:
\[
f\left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{3}{4}\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4},
\]
so \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 4\) is a valid solution.

Thus, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']","(3,4]",[],True
"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The given equation is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can further simplify this by recognizing that \(\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ\) and \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

This expression is equal to \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\sin 30^\circ}{\cos 30^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}\).

" ellipsis refers to the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ellipse."" To find this, we need to determine the number of distinct permutations of the letters in the word ""ellipse.""

The word ""ellipse"" consists of the letters: E, L, L, I, S, E. Here, the letter E appears twice, and the letter L also appears twice.

To find the number of distinct permutations, we use the formula for permutations of a multiset:

\[
\text{Number of distinct permutations} = \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

In this case:
- The total number of letters \( n = 6 \) (E, L, L, I, S, E).
- The frequency of E, \( n_1 = 2 \).
- The frequency of L, \( n_2 = 2 \).
- The frequency of I, \( n_3 = 1 \).
- The frequency of S, \( n_4 = 1 \).
- The frequency of the remaining letter (which is S), \( n_5 = 1 \).

Now we can substitute these values into the formula:

\]

Calculating the factorials:

- \( 6! = 720 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \)

Now substituting these values into the formula:

\[

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the first 42 positive integers.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( x = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), so \( f(x, y) = y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \). Similarly, if either \( y = 1 \) or \( y = -1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \), so \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \). Therefore, the maximum value on the boundary is 0.

Next, we consider the interior of the region \( -1 < x, y < 1 \). To do this, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

The golden ratio \( \phi \) satisfies the quadratic equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). We can use this property to find the possible values of \( z \). The solutions to the equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \) are:

\[ z = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{(\phi + 1) - 4}}{2} = \frac{\phi \pm \sqrt{\phi - 3}}{2}. \]

However, we can also use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \). This implies that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are complex numbers on the unit circle, and they can be written in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). Therefore, we have:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \cos \theta = \phi. \]

Since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618 \), which is greater than 1, there is no real angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation. However, we can still use the periodicity of the exponential function to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

We know that \( z^2 = \phi z - 1 \). We can use this recurrence relation to find higher powers of \( z \). Let's compute the first few powers of \( z \):

\[ z^3 = z \cdot z^2 = z(\phi z - 1) = \phi z^2 - z = \phi(\phi z - 1) - z = \phi^2 z - \phi - z = (\phi + 1)z - \phi - z = \phi z - \phi = \phi(z - 1). \]

\[ z^4 = z \cdot z^3 = z(\phi(z - 1)) = \phi z^2 - \phi z = \phi(\phi z - 1) - \phi z = \phi^2 z - \phi - \phi z = (\phi - 1)z - \phi. \]

We can see that the powers of \( z \) are becoming more complex, so let's use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \). This implies that \( z^2 = \phi z - 1 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = \frac{1}{\phi z - 1} \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are complex numbers on the unit circle, and their powers will also be complex numbers on the unit circle.

We can use the property that \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = 2 \cos(n \theta) \) for some angle \( \theta \). Since \( \cos \theta = \phi \), we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos(85 \theta). \]

However, we can use the fact that \( \phi \) is a root of the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), which implies that \( \phi^3 = \phi^2 + \phi = \phi + 1 + \phi = 2\phi + 1 \). Therefore, \( \phi^4 = \phi(2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2 \).

We can see that the powers of \( \phi \) are growing, but we can use the fact that \( \phi \) is a root of the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \) to find the periodicity of the powers of \( z \). Since \( \phi \) is a root of the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), we have:

\[ \phi^5 = \phi(3\phi + 2) = 3\phi^2 + 2\phi = 3(\phi + 1) + 2\phi = 5\phi + 3. \]

Therefore, the powers of \( \phi \) are periodic with a period of 5. Therefore, \( \phi^{85} = \phi^5 = \phi + 1 \).

Since \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 - \phi z + 1 = 0 \), we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos(85 \theta) = 2 \cos(5 \cdot 17 \theta) = 2 \cos(5 \cdot 0) = 2 \cos(0) = 2. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(MGN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are points on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively such that \(MN \parallel BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides. Since \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\).

The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its height. Since the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\), the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64
\]

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively and \(MN \parallel BC\), the area of triangle \(MGN\) is the area of triangle \(AMN\) minus the area of triangle \(AGN\). The area of triangle \(AGN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(AMN\) because \(G\) divides \(AN\) in a 2:1 ratio. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGN\) is:

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The fourth term \(a_4 = 200\)
2. The eighth term \(a_8 = 500\)

Using the general form of the \(n\)-th term, we can write the equations for the fourth and eighth terms as follows:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the fourth term from the equation for the eighth term:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]

"To determine the probability that the checkerboard square where the checker is placed is one of the squares that are white, we need to analyze the process of generating the two numbers and the resulting checkerboard pattern.

1. **First Number Generation:**
   - The first number is obtained by dividing the total number of rotations by 4 and taking the remainder. This means the first number can be 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - The first number corresponds to the column of the checkerboard. The columns are labeled as follows:
     - 0: Column 1
     - 1: Column 2
     - 2: Column 3
     - 3: Column 4

2. **Second Number Generation:**
   - The second number is obtained by dividing the total number of rotations by 5 and taking the remainder. This means the second number can be 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The second number corresponds to the row of the checkerboard. The rows are labeled as follows:
     - 0: Row 1
     - 1: Row 2
     - 2: Row 3
     - 3: Row 4
     - 4: Row 5

3. **Checkerboard Pattern:**
   - The checkerboard is colored in a checkerboard pattern, where the top-left square is black. This means that a square is black if the sum of its row and column indices is even, and white if the sum is odd.
   - We need to count the number of white squares in the 5x4 checkerboard.

4. **Counting White Squares:**
   - There are 5 rows and 4 columns, so there are \(5 \times 4 = 20\) squares in total.
   - In a 5x4 checkerboard, half of the squares are white and half are black. This is because each row alternates between black and white, and there are an even number of rows and columns.
   - Therefore, the number of white squares is \(20 / 2 = 10\).

5. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that the checker is placed on a white square is the number of white squares divided by the total number of squares.
   - Thus, the probability is \(\frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}\).

The final answer is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To determine the sum of the digits of the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

The finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of this decimal number. The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Therefore, the sum of the digits of the finite decimal representation is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use properties of the sine function and symmetry in the unit circle.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\). The product \(\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ\) can be simplified using the product-to-sum identities, but a more straightforward approach is to use known results from trigonometric products. It is known that:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Therefore, the original product is:
\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in the cylindrical coordinate system \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in Cartesian coordinates.

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

Given the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates, it directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:
\[ z = c. \]

This equation describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a constant height \(c\) along the \(z\)-axis. In other words, for any values of \(x\) and \(y\), the value of \(z\) is always \(c\).

Therefore, the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in the cylindrical coordinate system is a plane.

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

Given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we first calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we find:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[
\theta = \sin^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = 30^\circ
\]

Therefore, the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the sum of the numbers \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \).

This can be written as:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15
\]
Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we have:
\[
(r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 10.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
3 + 10 = 13.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

Let's denote the measure of the one interior angle that is excluded as \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining \(n-1\) interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
180(n-2) - x = 1070
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). This gives us the inequality:

\[
0 < x < 180
\]

Substituting the expression for \(x\) from the equation above, we get:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

We can break this compound inequality into two separate inequalities:

1. \(180(n-2) - 1070 > 0\)
2. \(180(n-2) - 1070 < 180\)

Solving the first inequality:

\[
180(n-2) > 1070

\[

\]
\[
n-2 > 5.9444

\[
n > 7.9444

\[
n-2 < \frac{1150}{180}

\[
n-2 < 6.3889

\[
n < 8.3889

\[
n \leq 8

Combining these two results, we get:

\[
n = 8

"To solve for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by understanding the condition given. The modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

In this problem, \( x = t + 2 \), so we have:

\[ t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x = -x \) modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of one side of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the length of one side of the cube.**

The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \(s\) is the length of one side. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we have:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \(A\) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the value of \(s\), we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \(T\) is:
\[ T = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\) square feet.","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). The product of a number and its conjugate is given by the formula \((a + b\sqrt{c})(a - b\sqrt{c}) = a^2 - b^2c\). Here, \(a = 5\), \(b = 1\), and \(c = 3\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To determine the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:
\[
a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\tan(\theta) = x\), and \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Thus, the expression inside the sine function simplifies to:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \theta + \theta = 2\theta.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin(2\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta)\), we get:
\[
2\sin(\theta)\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Since \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\), we substitute these into the equation:
\[
2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2 \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

We need to check if these solutions are valid by ensuring they satisfy the domain of the original functions. Both \(3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(3 - 2\sqrt{2}\) are positive, so they are valid solutions.

"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first need to verify that the direction vectors are parallel. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Notice that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the direction vectors are indeed parallel.

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of either line. We can use \(\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{d}_1\).

Let \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector \(\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2\) is

\[
\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 - (-5) \\ -10 - (-3) \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
(\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2) \times \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-2) - (-5)(-9)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-2) - (-5)(2)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-9) - (-7)(2)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get

\[
\mathbf{i}(14 - 45) - \mathbf{j}(-16 + 10) + \mathbf{k}(-72 + 14) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of this vector is

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(D\) between the two lines is

\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2 \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units.

A point \((x,y)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle if its coordinates satisfy the inequalities:
\[
-5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4.
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

First, we count the number of possible values for \(x\). The integers from \(-4\) to \(4\) are:

There are 7 possible values for \(y\).

To find the total number of integer coordinate points that lie strictly inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.

Substituting these values into the expression, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 - 21 + 14 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

- Brazil: 12 stamps at $6 each
- France: 12 stamps at $4 each
- Peru: 12 stamps at $5 each
- Spain: 12 stamps at $3 each

Next, we calculate the total price for each country:

First, note that since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC}\) must also bisect \(\angle ABC\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADC\) are congruent because they share the side \(\overline{AC}\), have equal angles \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\) and \(\angle BCA = \angle ACD\) (since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\)), and equal sides \(\overline{AB} = \overline{CD}\) and \(\overline{BC} = \overline{AD}\).

Since \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ADC\) are congruent, their areas are equal. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

Given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

First, we need to understand the condition under which the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. Two line segments intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the plane. That is, if we traverse the points in one order, the next point must be of a different type, and this pattern must continue.

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Out of these 24 permutations, only 8 will result in the line segments intersecting. These 8 permutations are the ones where the points are arranged in an alternating pattern. For example, if we have the points in the order \(A, C, B, D\), then the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect.

To see why there are 8 such permutations, consider the following:
1. Fix one point, say \(A\).
2. Arrange the remaining three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the remaining three positions. There are \(3!\) (6) ways to do this.
3. For each arrangement of \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), there are 2 ways to assign the points to the positions such that the pattern is alternating (e.g., \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\)).

Therefore, the total number of permutations that result in the line segments intersecting is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).

However, we must also consider that the points can be arranged in any order, and each arrangement has a corresponding arrangement that results in the same intersection pattern. Thus, the correct number of distinct permutations that result in the line segments intersecting is \(8\).

The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable permutations to the total number of permutations:

"To determine how many circular cylindrical buckets are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the bucket and the tank and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the bucket's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. The radius of the tank is given as 6 cm. Substituting the radius into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one circular cylindrical bucket. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The radius of the bucket is given as 3 cm and the height is given as 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{bucket}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many buckets are required to fill the tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one bucket:
\[ \text{Number of buckets} = \frac{V_{\text{tank}}}{V_{\text{bucket}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of buckets needed to fill the tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

Now, we substitute these into the original expression:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A)
\]

We expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A
\]

Notice that the last two terms cancel each other out:
\[
= \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B
\]

We can factor out \(\sin A \cos A\) from the first term:
\[
= \sin A \cos A \sin B \cos B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B
\]

Recall that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). We need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now substitute these values into the expression:
\[
\sin A \cos A \sin B \cos B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0.4^2 \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2
\]

Simplify the first term:
\[
0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.5 \cdot \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{3}}{5 \cdot 2} = \frac{0.2 \cdot \sqrt{63}}{10} = \frac{0.2 \cdot 3\sqrt{7}}{10} = \frac{0.6\sqrt{7}}{10} = \frac{3\sqrt{7}}{50}
\]

Simplify the second term:
\[
0.4^2 \cdot \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = 0.16 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.12
\]

Now, substitute these back into the expression:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{50} - 0.12
\]

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator of 50 and 1 is 50:
\[
0.12 = \frac{12}{100} = \frac{3}{25} = \frac{6}{50}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{3\sqrt{7}}{50} - \frac{6}{50} = \frac{3\sqrt{7} - 6}{50}
\]

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a group of 8 public members and 6 private members, with the condition that each subcommittee must include at least one public member and at least one private member, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members:**
   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \).
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with only public members:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 public members is \( \binom{8}{5} \).
   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with only private members:**
   The number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 private members is \( \binom{6}{5} \).
   \[
   \binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that includes at least one public member and at least one private member:**
   This is the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee minus the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with only public members and the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee with only private members.
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} - \binom{8}{5} - \binom{6}{5} = 2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

So the equation becomes:

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle AMB \), we can find \( BM \) and \( CM \):
\[
BM = CM = \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 121}.
\]
Thus, the length of \( BC \) is:
\[
BC = 2BM = 2\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}.
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \), so:
\[
\angle DBC + \angle DCB + \angle BDC = 180^\circ.
\]
Since \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB \) (because \( \triangle BDC \) is isosceles with \( BD = CD \)), we have:
\[
2\angle DBC + 3\theta = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}.
\]

Now, consider \( \triangle ABD \). The sum of the angles in \( \triangle ABD \) is also \( 180^\circ \), so:
\[
\angle BAD + \angle ABD + \angle BDA = 180^\circ.
\]
Since \( \angle BAD = \frac{\theta}{2} \) and \( \angle ABD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} + \angle BDA = 180^\circ \implies \angle BDA = 180^\circ - 90^\circ + \theta = 90^\circ + \theta.
\]

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \) again. Since \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we have:
\[
\angle BDA + \angle BDC = (90^\circ + \theta) + 3\theta = 90^\circ + 4\theta.
\]
However, this sum should be \( 180^\circ \), so we need to re-evaluate the angles. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) is not possible. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) is not possible. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) is not possible.

Finally, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) is not possible. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) is not possible.

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + 2\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}.
\]

Using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 90^\circ + \theta \) is not possible, we find that \( AB = 22 \) and \( BC = 2\sqrt{22^2 - 121} = 2\sqrt{308} = 4\sqrt{77} \).

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
22 + 22 + 4\sqrt{77} = 44 + 4\sqrt{77}.

Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

"To find the middle value of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

Solving for \(a\), we find:

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]

The 27 consecutive integers are therefore:

\[

The middle value of these 27 integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence starting from \(a\) with a common difference of 1 is given by:

\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,

\[

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have the system of equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.

From the second equation, we can express \(s\) in terms of \(p\):
\[
s = \frac{24}{p}.

Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = \frac{24}{p}\left(\left(\frac{24}{p}\right)^2 - 3p\right),

\[

"To determine which grade has the number of male students who prefer taking the bus closest to 135% of the number of female students who prefer taking the bus, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate 135% of the number of female students who prefer taking the bus for each grade.
2. Compare these values to the number of male students who prefer taking the bus for each grade.

First, let's calculate 135% of the number of female students who prefer taking the bus for each grade. Since there are 300 male students and 300 female students in each grade, the number of female students who prefer taking the bus is given in the table. We will calculate 135% of these values:

- For the 9th grade: \(135\% \times 39.4 = 0.135 \times 39.4 = 5.329\)
- For the 10th grade: \(135\% \times 33.1 = 0.135 \times 33.1 = 4.4685\)
- For the 11th grade: \(135\% \times 13.8 = 0.135 \times 13.8 = 1.863\)
- For the 12th grade: \(135\% \times 8.6 = 0.135 \times 8.6 = 1.161\)

Now, let's compare these values to the number of male students who prefer taking the bus for each grade:

- For the 9th grade: The number of male students who prefer taking the bus is \(41.1\%\). This is \(0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\).
- For the 10th grade: The number of male students who prefer taking the bus is \(34.4\%\). This is \(0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\).
- For the 11th grade: The number of male students who prefer taking the bus is \(20.6\%\). This is \(0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\).
- For the 12th grade: The number of male students who prefer taking the bus is \(11.6\%\). This is \(0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\).

We need to find which of these values is closest to 5.329, 4.4685, 1.863, or 1.161.

The correct interpretation should be the closest value in the context of the problem, which is the 11th grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

### Step 1: Factor the denominator
The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)
\]

### Step 2: Identify the critical points
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. These points are:
- \(x^2 - 81 = 0 \implies x = \pm 9\)
- \(x(x - 36) = 0 \implies x = 0\) or \(x = 36\)

So, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

### Step 3: Determine the sign of the expression in each interval
We need to test the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

#### Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)
Choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((-\infty, -9)\).

#### Interval \((-9, 0)\)
Choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((-9, 0)\).

#### Interval \((0, 9)\)
Choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in \((0, 9)\).

#### Interval \((9, 36)\)
Choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in \((9, 36)\).

#### Interval \((36, \infty)\)
Choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in \((36, \infty)\).

### Step 4: Consider the critical points
The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

### Step 5: Combine the results
The expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum area of the rectangular field, we need to analyze the structure of the track. The track consists of a rectangle with two semicircles at each end. The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles, which is equivalent to the perimeter of the rectangle.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two semicircles at each end have a diameter equal to the width \( W \), so the circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi W \). Therefore, the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We want to maximize the area \( A \) of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \times W \]

From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} \]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0 \]
\[ \pi W = 200 \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100 \]

The maximum area \( A \) is then:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum area of the rectangular field is:

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can denote the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) as 2 and the hypotenuse as 5. Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(x\):

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we minimize the function inside the square root, \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). The corresponding \(y\)-coordinates are:

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

The points on the curve closest to the origin are \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\). The distance from either point to the origin is:

\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the shortest distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( B \) of the regular tetrahedron, we start by determining the side length of the tetrahedron. Let the side length be \( s \).

The vertices of a regular tetrahedron can be placed in a coordinate system as follows:
- \( A = \left(1, 1, 1\right) \)
- \( B = \left(1, -1, -1\right) \)
- \( C = \left(-1, 1, -1\right) \)
- \( D = \left(-1, -1, 1\right) \)

The distance from \( P \) to each of these vertices is given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( B \).

First, we calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( A \):
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-1)^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( B \):
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

We know the distances from \( P \) to the other vertices:
\[
PC = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + (z+1)^2} = 7
\]
\[
PD = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z-1)^2} = 8
\]
\[
PE = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z+1)^2} = 9
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is constant. This sum is given by:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 6s^2 + 6d^2
\]
where \( d \) is the distance from the point to the centroid of the tetrahedron. Since the centroid of a regular tetrahedron is the average of its vertices, the distance from \( P \) to the centroid is the same for all vertices.

We can use the given distances to find \( s \) and \( d \). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are symmetric and can be used to find the distance to the sixth vertex.

By symmetry and the given distances, we can deduce that the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( B \) is:

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the ball on the ice, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration (\(F = ma\)).

Let's denote the force applied by the stick as \(F\). The acceleration of the soft ball, \(a_s\), can be expressed as:
\[a_s = \frac{F}{m_s}\]
where \(m_s\) is the mass of the soft ball. Given that the mass of the soft ball is 200 g, we convert this to kilograms (since the standard unit for mass in physics is kilograms):
\[m_s = 200 \text{ g} = 0.2 \text{ kg}\]
So, the acceleration of the soft ball is:
\[a_s = \frac{F}{0.2}\]

The acceleration of the ball on the ice, \(a_i\), can be expressed as:
\[a_i = \frac{F}{m_i}\]
where \(m_i\) is the mass of the ball on the ice. Given that the mass of the ball on the ice is 150 g, we convert this to kilograms:
\[m_i = 150 \text{ g} = 0.15 \text{ kg}\]
So, the acceleration of the ball on the ice is:
\[a_i = \frac{F}{0.15}\]

The ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the ball on the ice is:
\[\frac{a_s}{a_i} = \frac{\frac{F}{0.2}}{\frac{F}{0.15}} = \frac{F}{0.2} \cdot \frac{0.15}{F} = \frac{0.15}{0.2} = \frac{15}{20} = \frac{3}{4}\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

Now, we compare the 7-ary and 8-ary representations of \(629_{10}\). We see that \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\) are different numbers. Therefore, there are no numbers from \(629_{10}\) that have the same representation in both 7-ary and 8-ary numeral systems.

"To determine how many times the amicable relationships occurred in the meeting, we need to analyze the given conditions:

1. There are six members of the choir and one choir president.
2. Each choir member decided to amicably exit the meeting with one of the other choir members.
3. No choir member amicably exited the meeting with the choir president.

Let's denote the choir members as \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \), and the choir president as \( P \). Each choir member \( X \) (where \( X \) is one of \( A, B, C, D, E, F \)) amicably exited the meeting with exactly one other choir member \( Y \) (where \( Y \) is one of \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) but not \( X \)). This means that the amicable relationships form a perfect matching among the six choir members.

A perfect matching in a set of six elements means that each element is paired with exactly one other element, resulting in three pairs. Therefore, there are three amicable relationships in total.

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The vertices are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The center \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The condition that a point \(P\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed using the distance formula. Specifically, \(P\) must satisfy:
\[ OP < PA, \quad OP < PB, \quad OP < PC, \quad OP < PD. \]

These inequalities define four regions inside the rectangle, each bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\). These perpendicular bisectors intersect at the center \(O\) and form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\).

The smaller rectangle is similar to the original rectangle \(ABCD\) and has its center at \(O\). The ratio of the sides of the smaller rectangle to the original rectangle is the same as the ratio of the distances from \(O\) to the sides of the smaller rectangle to the distances from \(O\) to the sides of the original rectangle.

Since \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonals, the distance from \(O\) to any side of the smaller rectangle is half the distance from \(O\) to the corresponding side of the original rectangle. Therefore, the ratio of the sides of the smaller rectangle to the original rectangle is \(1:2\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of the original rectangle. Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7082 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} > 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents are left after converting the total amount of money into dollars and cents, we first need to calculate the total amount of money spent by Rain, Simplice, Quan, and Coxi.

1. Calculate the total amount spent:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. Add the amounts step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

3. The total amount spent is $126.59. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert $126.59 into cents:
   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. To find out how many cents are left, we need to know the number of cents in a dollar. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, the number of cents left is:
   \[
   12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

Therefore, the number of cents left is \(\boxed{12659}\).","[12659, '12659']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the entire student class, we need to calculate the total score of all students and then divide that by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Determine the total score for each group of students:
   - 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for this group is:
     \[
     20 \times 80 = 1600
     \]
   - 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for this group is:
     \[
     8 \times 90 = 720
     \]
   - 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for this group is:
     \[
     2 \times 100 = 200
     \]

2. Add up the total scores from all groups to get the overall total score:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

3. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students to get the average score:
   \[
   \text{Average score} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84
   \]

Therefore, the average score of the student class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify by calculating the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
This is true for any \( n \), so it is consistent.

Next, let's verify by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
This is true for any \( n \), so it is consistent.

Next, let's verify by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify by calculating the sum of the numbers in the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
2n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
This is true for any \( n \), so it is consistent.

Finally, let's verify by calculating the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
4n - 13 = 2n + 1 \implies 2n = 14 \implies n = 7
\]

Next, let's verify by calculating the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 3n - 6
\]
For this to be equal to \( S \), we must have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1 \implies n = 7
\]

Since all the sums are equal to \( 2n + 1 \) when \( n = 7 \), the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Farrah walks compared to Farah, we need to calculate the distance each person walks and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Farah walks. Farah walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Given that the length is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Farah walks 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Farrah walks. Farrah walks along the perimeter of the rectangle. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
P = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Farrah walks 1400 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distance Farrah walks and the distance Farah walks:
\[
1400 - 500 = 900 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Farrah walks \(\boxed{900}\) feet more than Farah.","[900, '900']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number satisfying \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
