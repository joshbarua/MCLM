"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at coordinates \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at coordinates \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\), and the length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\) and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\), the length \(EF\) is simply the difference in the y-coordinates of \(E\) and \(F\), which is 7 units. This confirms that the y-coordinate of \(E\) is correct.

Next, we need to find the length of \(DE\). The coordinates of \(D\) are \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and the coordinates of \(E\) are \((0, 7)\). The distance between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the plane is given by the distance formula:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\) into the formula, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{(0 - \sqrt{51})^2 + (7 - 7)^2} = \sqrt{(-\sqrt{51})^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \).
   \[
   z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   A rotation by \( -\frac{\pi}{4} \) is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{-i\pi/4} = \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   Let \( z' = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \). The rotated complex number \( z'' \) is given by:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3 \sqrt{2})i \cdot \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 - i + \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i - \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i^2 = 1 - i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i + \frac{(3 - 3 \sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 - i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}
   \]
   Combining the real and imaginary parts:
   \[
   z'' = \left(1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}\right) + \left(-1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}\right)i = \left(\frac{2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{-2 + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}\right)i = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2}\right)i
   \]

3. **Translate back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the rotated complex number \( z'' \).
   \[
   w = z'' + c = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2}\right)i + (2 - 3i) = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4}{2} + 2\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2} - 3\right)i = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 4 + 4}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8 - 6}{2}\right)i = \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{3\sqrt{2} - 14}{2}\right)i

"To determine the number of distinct ways to seat 8 people around a round table, with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"".** This reduces the problem to seating 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 ""people"" in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.** There are 3 people in the block, and the number of ways to arrange 3 people in a line is \(3! = 6\).

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the block by the number of ways to arrange the other 5 individuals within their block.** This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

So the expression becomes:

This simplifies to:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated in the opposite direction (senso antiorario) to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

A regular pentagon has 5 sides of equal length and 5 angles of equal measure. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after every rotation that is a multiple of the angle corresponding to one of its sides.

The full rotation around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since the pentagon has 5 sides, each side subtends an angle of:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that the pentagon will look the same after every 72 degrees of rotation. To coincide with its original position, the pentagon must be rotated by a multiple of 72 degrees.

In the opposite direction (senso antiorario), the pentagon will look the same after every 360 degrees minus a multiple of 72 degrees. The smallest positive angle that satisfies this condition is 360 degrees minus 72 degrees, which is:
\[
360^\circ - 72^\circ = 288^\circ
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated in the opposite direction to coincide with its original position is:

"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same as the midpoint of the first diagonal:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the two midpoints equal to each other, we get:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the sum \(x + y\) is consistent with the given condition \(x > 7\).

Given the correct interpretation, the correct coordinates should be \((8, 5)\) as the problem constraints and the correct calculation should be re-evaluated. The correct answer should be:

"To find the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and any other relevant information.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same point. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\]
holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm (or spectral norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.

Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

We need to calculate the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify.

Let's start with the expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[

\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):
\[

\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Now, we will perform the multiplications:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^3\), we get:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
3b = 6
\]
Divide by 3:
\[
b = 2
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t^2\), we get:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
Simplify:
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
4a = -12
\]
Divide by 4:
\[
a = -3
\]

By comparing the coefficients of \(t\), we get:
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16

Simplify:
\[
-10 - 6 = -16

\[
-16 = -16

This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[

Simplify:
\[
6 = 6
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical serbatoio, we need to analyze the given information and use the formulas for the volume of a cylinder and the rate of change of the volume.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height (or the depth of the water in this case).

We are given that the serbatoio is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \).

To find the radius \( r \), we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):
\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of each piece of the function:
1. For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).
2. For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the function must be continuous and cover all possible \(y\)-values. This means that the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left must be less than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the right.

Let's evaluate the function at \(x = a\):
- From the left, \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).
- From the right, \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]

Rearranging this inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]

The roots of the polynomial \(a(a - 2)(a + 1)\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the polynomial is non-positive. We can test the sign of the polynomial in the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\):

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0\). So, the polynomial is non-positive in \((- \infty, -1)\).
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \geq 0\). So, the polynomial is positive in \((-1, 0)\).
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\). So, the polynomial is non-positive in \((0, 2)\).
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \geq 0\). So, the polynomial is positive in \((2, \infty)\).

Therefore, the polynomial \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) is satisfied in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([0, 2]\). Since \(a\) must be a number such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(2\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (provided that \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\), which is true for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) \neq x\), \(y \neq x\). Therefore, we need to solve the system:
\[
f(x) = y \quad \text{and} \quad f(y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into \(f(y) = x\), we get:
\[
f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x \implies \lambda \lambda x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1 \implies \lambda^4 x^3 - 2\lambda^3 x^2 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 1 - \lambda^2 = 0.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), the cubic equation must have a root in the interval \((0,1)\). We will check the values of \(\lambda\) for which this is possible.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \(\lambda\):
- For \(\lambda = 1\), the equation becomes:
  \[
  1 - 1 + 1 - 1 = 0,
  \]
  which is true for all \(x\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution, and \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} \neq \frac{1}{2}\), and \(f\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\). So, \(\lambda = 1\) is a solution.
- For \(\lambda = 4\), the equation becomes:
  \[
  256 x^3 - 448 x^2 + 80 x + 1 - 16 = 0 \implies 256 x^3 - 448 x^2 + 80 x - 15 = 0.
  \]
  We can check that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a root of this equation, and the cubic equation has no real roots in the interval \((0,1)\).

For \(1 < \lambda < 4\), the cubic equation \(\lambda^4 x^3 - 2\lambda^3 x^2 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 1 - \lambda^2 = 0\) must have a root in the interval \((0,1)\). By the Intermediate Value Theorem and the fact that the function is continuous, there must be a value of \(\lambda\) for which the equation has a root in \((0,1)\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The expression is:

\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ + \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\), we can rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can further simplify this by using the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) again. Let \(x = 25^\circ\). Then \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities for sine and cosine, we have:

\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A + B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A - B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, the numerator becomes:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ.
\]

The denominator becomes:

\[
\cos 65^\circ + \cos 5^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 35^\circ.
\]

Therefore, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{\sqrt{3} \cos 35^\circ} = \tan 35^\circ.
\]

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E, where the letter E appears twice.

- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter I, \( n_3 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter P, \( n_4 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter S, \( n_5 \), is 1.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_6 \), is 1 (since it is already counted as \( n_1 \)).

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function's symmetry and possible critical points.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points. The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:

\]
From the first equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = x^2 y^2 (1 - x^2).
\]
From the second equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^4 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 = x^2 y^2 (1 - y^2).
\]
By symmetry, we can test the values \( x = y \). Substituting \( x = y \) into the function, we get:

f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \):
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting the derivative to zero, we get:
\[
2(1 - 2x^2) = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into the function, we get:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the fact that the area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

"Given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta. \]

Equating the two expressions, we get:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The corresponding angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \frac{7\pi}{10} \).

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Since \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \theta = \frac{7\pi}{10} \), we have:

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{10} = \frac{255\pi}{10} = 25.5\pi = 25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{10} = \frac{595\pi}{10} = 59.5\pi = 59\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}. \]

In both cases, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 0 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

"To find the area of the triangle \(ENG\), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \(G\) and the medians of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these six smaller triangles is \(\frac{144}{6} = 24\).

Now, let's focus on triangle \(ENG\). Notice that triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) because \(EG\) is parallel to \(BC\). The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the sides. Since \(G\) divides the medians in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(E\) to \(NG\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(B\) to \(AC\), and the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\).

Thus, the ratio of the areas of triangles \(ENG\) and \(ABC\) is the square of the ratio of the corresponding sides, which is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\).

Therefore, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is \(\frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16\).

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \), because the exponent of 2 on the left side of the equation is 24, and the exponent of 2 on the right side is \( n \log_2 k \), which must be an integer.

"To determine how many nickels Hillary has, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things from the problem:
1. Hillary has a total of 11 coins (dimes and nickels).
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \) (since each dime is worth 10 cents and each nickel is worth 5 cents)

We can solve this system of equations step by step. First, we'll solve the first equation for \( d \):
\[ d = 11 - n \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( d \) into the second equation:
\[ 10(11 - n) + 5n = 75 \]

Now, we distribute the 10:
\[ 110 - 10n + 5n = 75 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 110 - 5n = 75 \]

Subtract 110 from both sides:
\[ -5n = 75 - 110 \]
\[ -5n = -35 \]

Divide both sides by -5:
\[ n = \frac{-35}{-5} \]
\[ n = 7 \]

So, Hillary has 7 nickels. To verify, we can find the number of dimes by substituting \( n = 7 \) back into the equation \( d = 11 - n \):
\[ d = 11 - 7 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Check the total value:
\[ 10d + 5n = 10(4) + 5(7) = 40 + 35 = 75 \]

For the first triangle, the base is 2 units (from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 2\)) and the height is 4 units (from \(y = 4\) to \(y = 0\)). Therefore, the area of the first triangle is:

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include all the prime factors of 450 in its factorization. Therefore, the number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25.

(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

7 = 14 \sin \theta

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \). The function \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( h \) units results in the function \( f(x+h) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is obtained by shifting \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Shifting a function does not change the sum of its roots. The roots of \( g(x) \) are simply the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted to the left by 5 units. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15. \]

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ 49 - 15 = 34. \]

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.

Thus, the original expression becomes:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all its internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the internal angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Let the measure of the missing internal angle be \(x\). Therefore, the sum of all the internal angles except one is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
   \]
   This implies:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]

2. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   Since \(x\) is an internal angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < x < 180^\circ
   \]
   This gives us the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

3. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Now, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

4. **Combine the results:**
   From the two inequalities, we get:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is:
   \[
   n = 8

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( t \) is odd, \( 0 < t < 23 \), and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, we expand the left-hand side of the congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Next, we rearrange the terms to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23}. \]
Since \( 8 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We test values to find \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 6^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \]

\[ 9^2 \equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}. \]
So, \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \). Substituting this back into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \pmod{23}. \]
This gives us two potential solutions:
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \equiv \frac{8}{2} \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ t \equiv \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \equiv \frac{-12}{2} \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}. \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\).

Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

Simplifying the components, we get:

\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates strictly inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):
\[
9 \times 7 = 63

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

"To find the average price of Juan's francobolli from the 70s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of francobolli from each country in the 70s.
2. Calculate the total price of all the francobolli from the 70s.
3. Divide the total price by the number of francobolli to get the average price.

From the table, we can see the following:
- Brazil: 6 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 12 stamps
- Spain: 6 stamps

The price per stamp is 6 centesimi for Brazil, 4 centesimi for France, 5 centesimi for Peru, and 4 centesimi for Spain.

Now, we calculate the total price for each country:
- Total price for Brazil: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ centesimi/stamp} = 36 \text{ centesimi}\)
- Total price for France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ centesimi/stamp} = 48 \text{ centesimi}\)
- Total price for Peru: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ centesimi/stamp} = 60 \text{ centesimi}\)
- Total price for Spain: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ centesimi/stamp} = 24 \text{ centesimi}\)

Next, we sum these total prices to get the overall total price for the 70s:
\[36 + 48 + 60 + 24 = 168 \text{ centesimi}\]

Now, we divide the total price by the total number of stamps to find the average price:
\[ \text{Total number of stamps} = 6 + 12 + 12 + 6 = 36 \]
\[ \text{Average price} = \frac{168 \text{ centesimi}}{36} = \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.6667 \text{ centesimi} \]

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{d}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times AC
\]

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times AC + \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times (b + c) \times AC
\]

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (b + c) \times AC = 42 \implies (b + c) \times AC = 84
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC
\]

To find \([\triangle ACD]\), we need to express \(c \times AC\) in terms of the given information. From \((b + c) \times AC = 84\), we can solve for \(c \times AC\) by considering the ratio \(\frac{b}{c} = \frac{d}{a}\). However, we can directly use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid.

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as one of the legs. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC
\]

Given that the total area of the trapezoid is 42 and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of this total area, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the total area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) and the ratio of the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\) is equal to the ratio of the areas of the triangles.

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"Per risolvere l equazione \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\),abbiamo bisogno di eseguire le seguenti passaggi:

1. **Eliminare i radicali**: Moltiplichiamo entrambi i lati della equazione per il prodotto dei denominatori radicali:
   \[
   \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{3x-1} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot \sqrt{3x-1} \cdot \sqrt{3x-1}
   \]
   Questo give:
   \[
   \sqrt{2x} \cdot \sqrt{3x-1} = \frac{3}{2} \cdot (3x-1)
   \]

2. **Squaring Both Sides**: Per esprimere l'equazione in forma ridotta, squobbiamo i due lati:
   \[
   2x \cdot (3x-1) = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 \cdot (3x-1)^2
   \]
   Calcoliamo i quadrati:
   \[
   2x \cdot (3x-1) = \frac{9}{4} \cdot (3x-1)^2
   \]

3. **Risolvi il prodotto**: Calcoliamo \(2x \cdot (3x-1)\):
   \[
   2x \cdot (3x-1) = 6x^2 - 2x
   \]

4. **Risolvi il quadrato**: Calcoliamo \((3x-1)^2\):
   \[
   (3x-1)^2 = 9x^2 - 6x + 1

   Quindi, il secondo termine diventa:
   \[
   \frac{9}{4} \cdot (9x^2 - 6x + 1) = \frac{81x^2}{4} - \frac{54x}{4} + \frac{9}{4} = \frac{81x^2 - 54x + 9}{4}
   \]

5. **Risolvi l'equazione**: Moltiplichiamo entrambi i lati per 4 per semplificare:
   \[
   4(6x^2 - 2x) = 81x^2 - 54x + 9
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   24x^2 - 8x = 81x^2 - 54x + 9
   \]

6. **Rearranging the equation**: Move tutti i termini di sinistra a sinistra e i termini di destra a destra:
   \[
   24x^2 - 8x - 81x^2 + 54x - 9 = 0
   \]
   Simplificando, otteniamo:
   \[
   -57x^2 + 46x - 9 = 0
   \]

7. **Risolvi l'equazione quadratica**: Utilizziamo la formula quadratica \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), dove \(a = -57\), \(b = 46\), e \(c = -9\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-46 \pm \sqrt{46^2 - 4(-57)(-9)}}{2(-57)}

   Calcoliamo \(b^2 - 4ac\):
   \[
   46^2 - 4 \cdot 57 \cdot 9 = 2116 - 2052 = 64

   Quindi, l'equazione diventa:
   \[
   x = \frac{-46 \pm \sqrt{64}}{-114} = \frac{-46 \pm 8}{-114}

8. **Calcoliamo i due soluzioni**:
   - Per \(+\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-46 + 8}{-114} = \frac{-38}{-114} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]
   - Per \(-\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-46 - 8}{-114} = \frac{-54}{-114} = \frac{3}{7}
   \]

9. **Verifichiamo le soluzioni**: Le soluzioni devono essere positive e soddisfacenti l'equazione originale. Verifichiamo:
   - Per \(x = \frac{1}{3}\):
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{1}{3}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{1}{3} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}}{\sqrt{0}} \quad \text{(non soddisfa)}

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

"To determine the probability that the segment \(AB\) and the segment \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points on the circle.

3. **Counting Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders). For example, if we fix point \(A\) at a position, then \(C\) and \(D\) must be on one side of \(A\) and \(B\) on the other side, or vice versa.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the ombreggiata region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Identify the radii and areas of the circles:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(r_1 = 1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(r_2 = 2\).
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(A_1 = \pi r_1^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(A_2 = \pi r_2^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi\).

2. **Calculate the area of the ombreggiata region:**
   - The area of the ombreggiata region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - Therefore, the area of the ombreggiata region is \(\frac{5}{12} \cdot 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

3. **Determine the area of the intersection of the two circles:**
   - The area of the ombreggiata region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the intersection of the two circles.
   - Let \(A_{\text{intersection}}\) be the area of the intersection of the two circles.
   - Then, \(\frac{5\pi}{3} = 4\pi - A_{\text{intersection}}\).
   - Solving for \(A_{\text{intersection}}\), we get \(A_{\text{intersection}} = 4\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{12\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{3}\).

4. **Find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   - The area of the intersection of two circles with radii \(r_1\) and \(r_2\) and distance between their centers \(d\) can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     A_{\text{intersection}} = r_1^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r_1^2 - r_2^2}{2dr_1}\right) + r_2^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r_2^2 - r_1^2}{2dr_2}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d + r_1 + r_2)(d + r_1 - r_2)(d - r_1 + r_2)(d + r_1 + r_2)}
     \]
   - However, in this problem, we can use a simpler approach by considering the geometry of the circles. The smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle subtended by the chord of the larger circle that is also a chord of the smaller circle.
   - The distance \(d\) between the centers of the circles is the same as the distance between the centers of the smaller and larger circles, which is the difference in their radii, \(d = 2 - 1 = 1\).
   - The smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) can be found using the formula for the angle subtended by a chord in a circle:
     \[
     \sin\left(\frac{\angle ADC}{2}\right) = \frac{d}{r_1} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, \(\frac{\angle ADC}{2} = 90^\circ\), so \(\angle ADC = 180^\circ\).

However, this result is incorrect because it does not match the given area of the ombreggiata region. The correct approach is to use the fact that the area of the intersection is \(\frac{7\pi}{3}\) and the area of the smaller circle is \(\pi\). The correct angle \(\angle ADC\) can be found by considering the geometry of the circles and the given area of the ombreggiata region.

\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the arcsine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = (\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A).
\]
We can expand this product:
\[
(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B)(\sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A) = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A + \cos A \sin B \sin B \cos A - \cos A \sin B \cos B \sin A.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin A \cos B \cos B \sin A = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = \sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A + \cos^2 A \sin^2 B - 2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B.
\]
We know that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). Therefore, \(\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = 0.9165\) and \(\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = 0.8660\). Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin A \cos B \sin B \cos A = 0.4 \cdot 0.8660 \cdot 0.5 \cdot 0.9165 = 0.1558,
\]
\[
\cos^2 A \sin^2 B = (0.9165)^2 \cdot (0.5)^2 = 0.84 \cdot 0.25 = 0.21,
\]
\[
2 \sin^2 A \cos^2 B = 2 \cdot (0.4)^2 \cdot (0.8660)^2 = 2 \cdot 0.16 \cdot 0.75 = 0.24.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
0.1558 + 0.21 - 0.24 = 0.1258.
\]
However, we can use a simpler approach by recognizing that the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\) can be simplified using the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x - y) - \cos (x + y)].
\]
Let \(x = \arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5\) and \(y = \arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4\). Then:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (x - y) - \cos (x + y)] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (2 \arcsin 0.5) - \cos (2 \arcsin 0.4)].
\]
We know that \(\cos (2 \arcsin 0.5) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.5) = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.25 = 0.5\) and \(\cos (2 \arcsin 0.4) = 1 - 2 \sin^2 (\arcsin 0.4) = 1 - 2 \cdot 0.16 = 0.68\). Therefore:
\[
\sin x \sin y = \frac{1}{2} [0.5 - 0.68] = \frac{1}{2} [-0.18] = -0.09.

1. Convertire i piedi al minuto in piedi al secondo.
2. Convertire i piedi al secondo in pollici al secondo.

### Passo 1: Convertire piedi al minuto in piedi al secondo

La bicicletta viaggia a 20 piedi al minuto. Per convertire questo into pollici al secondo, dobbiamo sapere che:

- 1 minuto = 60 secondi
- 1 piede = 12 pollici

Quindi, per convertire 20 piedi al minuto in piedi al secondo, dobbiamo divisione per il tempo in secondi:

\[
\text{Velocità in piedi al secondo} = \frac{20 \text{ piedi}}{60 \text{ secondi}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ piedi al secondo}
\]

### Passo 2: Convertire piedi al secondo in pollici al secondo

Ora, convertiamo \(\frac{1}{3}\) piedi al secondo in pollici al secondo:

\[
\text{Velocità in pollici al secondo} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ piedi al secondo} \times 12 \text{ pollici piedi} = 4 \text{ pollici al secondo}

"To determine the number of ways to form a sottocomitato of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible sottocomitanti and then subtracting the number of sottocomitanti that do not meet the criteria (i.e., sottocomitanti that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a sottocomitto of 5 members from the 14 members of the Senate. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a sottocomitto of 5 members that are all from the Repubblicani. There are 8 Repubblicani, so this is given by \( \binom{8}{5} \):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a sottocomitto of 5 members that are all from the Democratici. There are 6 Democratici, so this is given by \( \binom{6}{5} \):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Now, add the number of sottocomitanti that are all from one party:

\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, subtract this number from the total number of sottocomitanti to get the number of sottocomitanti that include at least one member from each party:

\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940
\]

Thus, the number of ways to form a sottocomitto of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three numbers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by trial and error or by using numerical methods. Let's try some integer values for \(x\):

If \(x = 4\):
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120.\]
This works, so the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we need to verify the second condition given in the problem, which states that the product of the three numbers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three numbers is:
\[\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]
So, the product of the three numbers divided by their average is:
\[\frac{x(x+1)(x+2)}{x+1} = x(x+2).\]
For \(x = 4\):
\[4 \cdot 6 = 24.\]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(4096 = 64^2\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.

Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos \theta = \frac{AM}{AB} = \frac{11}{AB}. \]
Thus,
\[ BM = AB \sin \theta \quad \text{and} \quad AB = \frac{11}{\cos \theta}. \]

Next, we use the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \):
\[ \sin 3\theta = \frac{BM}{BD} = \frac{AB \sin \theta}{BD}. \]
Since \( BD = AD - AB \cos \theta = 10 - \frac{11 \cos \theta}{\cos \theta} = 10 - 11 = -1 \), we have:
\[ \sin 3\theta = \frac{AB \sin \theta}{BD} = \frac{\frac{11 \sin \theta}{\cos \theta} \sin \theta}{1} = \frac{11 \sin^2 \theta}{\cos \theta}. \]

Using the triple angle identity for sine, \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \), we get:
\[ 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta = \frac{11 \sin^2 \theta}{\cos \theta}. \]
Since \( \sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \), we substitute \( \cos \theta = \frac{11}{AB} \) and solve for \( AB \).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \) implies a specific geometric relationship. By symmetry and the properties of isosceles triangles, we can deduce that \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \). Therefore, \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BCD = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle DBC = 30^\circ \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[ BC = 2 \cdot BD = 2 \cdot 10 = 20. \]
Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC = 10 \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ \sin 30^\circ = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{10}{AB} = \frac{1}{2}. \]
Thus,
\[ AB = 20. \]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( AC = 20 \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ AB + AC + BC = 20 + 20 + 20 = 60. \]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that the sum is \(3^7\), so we set up the equation:

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

"Per risolvere la disuglandia \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \),abbiamo bisogno di analizzare la funzione \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \).

### Step 1: Analyze the function \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \)

1. **Identify the domain**: The function \( f(x) \) is defined for all real numbers \( x \).

2. **Find the minimum value**: We can rewrite \( f(x) \) as:
   \[
   f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4(x^2)
   \]
   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then we have:
   \[
   f(y) = y^2 + 4y
   \]
   This is a quadratic function in \( y \). To find its minimum, we can complete the square:
   \[
   f(y) = (y + 2)^2 - 4
   \]
   The minimum value occurs at \( y = -2 \), and the minimum value is:
   \[
   f(-2) = (-2 + 2)^2 - 4 = -4
   \]
   Since \( y = x^2 \) is always non-negative, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) occurs at \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0) = 0^4 + 4 \cdot 0^2 = 0
   \]

### Step 2: Solve the inequalities

1. **First inequality**: \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \)
   - We know that \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \) for all \( x \) (since it is a sum of squares).
   - Therefore, the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \) is true for all \( x \).

2. **Second inequality**: \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)
   - We need to find the values of \( x \) such that:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]
   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then we have:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]
   We can factor this quadratic:
   \[
   (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0
   \]
   The roots of the equation \( (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \) are \( y = -7 \) and \( y = 3 \). The quadratic is negative between these roots, so:
   \[
   -7 < y < 3
   \]
   Since \( y = x^2 \) must be non-negative, we only consider:
   \[
   0 \leq y < 3
   \]
   This translates to:
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3
   \]
   Taking the square root gives:
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
   \]

### Step 3: Combine the results

Since the first inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \) is true for all \( x \), and the second inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) holds for \( -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \), we conclude that the solution to the original inequality is:

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).

\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),

s = 4.

   - Number of females: \( 33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \)
   - Ratio of males to females: \( \frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.039 \)

3. **11th Grade:**
   - Number of males: \( 20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \)
   - Number of females: \( 13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \)
   - Ratio of males to females: \( \frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.500 \)

4. **12th Grade:**
   - Number of males: \( 11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \)
   - Number of females: \( 8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \)
   - Ratio of males to females: \( \frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.356 \)

- For 10th Grade: \( 1.039 \)
- For 11th Grade: \( 1.500 \)
- For 12th Grade: \( 1.356 \)

The ratio that is closest to 1.35 is 1.356, which corresponds to the 12th Grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), and the expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as \(x(x-36)\). Therefore, the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]

Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. From the numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\), we get the critical points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). From the denominator \(x(x-36)\), we get the critical points \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

These critical points divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\). We will test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

1. For the interval \((-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
\[
\frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)^2 - 36(-10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 + 360} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-\infty, -9)\).

2. For the interval \((-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)^2 - 36(-1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 + 36} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
\]
So, the inequality does not hold in \((-9, 0)\).

3. For the interval \((0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{1^2 - 36(1)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{1 - 36} = \frac{80}{-35} = -\frac{16}{7} < 0.

So, the inequality holds in \((0, 9)\).

4. For the interval \((9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{10^2 - 36(10)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{100 - 360} = \frac{19}{-260} = -\frac{19}{260} < 0.
\]
So, the inequality holds in \((9, 36)\).

5. For the interval \((36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{37^2 - 36(37)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{1369 - 1332} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.

So, the inequality does not hold in \((36, \infty)\).

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves. The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), and it is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). Since the inequality is strict (\(< 0\)), the points \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\) are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the inequality holds:

"To find the area of the largest possible rectangular field that can be inscribed in a pista atletica, we need to consider the given information about the pista and the field. The pista is composed of two sides of the rectangle and two semicircles, and the total length of the pista is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The width \( W \) is also the diameter of the semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi W \), so the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \). The total length of the pista is the sum of the lengths of the two sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles, which gives us the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100
\]
The area of the rectangle is then:
\[
A = L \cdot W = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]
Therefore, the area of the largest possible field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the angles \(R\) and \(T\) are complementary, meaning \(R + T = 90^\circ\). The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

Next, we need to find \(\cos{R}\). In a right triangle, the cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the adjacent side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). We know the hypotenuse \(RS = 5\) and we can find the adjacent side \(ST\) using the Pythagorean theorem. Let \(ST = x\). Then, by the Pythagorean theorem:

\[
RS^2 = RT^2 + ST^2
\]

Since \(RT = \sqrt{21}\), we substitute the known values:

\[
5^2 = (\sqrt{21})^2 + x^2
\]

\[

\]

\[
x^2 = 4

\[

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point on the graph of \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is:

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Substituting \(x = \sqrt{2}\) (or \(x = -\sqrt{2}\)) back into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the minimum distance is \(\frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}\), where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there is no real solution for \( x > 3 \) that satisfies this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 8 equilateral triangle faces, 6 vertices, and 12 edges. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be paired such that each pair is connected by an edge, and the pairs are opposite to each other.

Given that the distances from a point \( P \) to five of the vertices of the octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) such that \( A \) and \( B \) are opposite vertices, \( C \) and \( D \) are opposite vertices, and \( E \) and \( F \) are opposite vertices. Without loss of generality, assume that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are as follows:
\[ PA = 3, \quad PB = 7, \quad PC = 8, \quad PD = 9, \quad PE = 11. \]
We need to find \( PF \).

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant. This is a consequence of the fact that the octahedron is a distance regular graph. The constant sum can be calculated as follows:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 4 \left( \frac{3a^2}{2} \right) = 6a^2, \]
where \( a \) is the edge length of the octahedron. However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to the vertices plus the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the center of the octahedron.

Since the center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is:
\[ 6 \left( \frac{a^2}{2} \right) = 3a^2. \]
Let \( O \) be the center of the octahedron. Then:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 6a^2. \]
We know that:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]
Therefore:
\[ 324 + PF^2 = 6a^2. \]
Since \( 6a^2 = 324 + PF^2 \), we can find \( PF^2 \) by:
\[ PF^2 = 6a^2 - 324. \]
However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is constant, and the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to the vertices is \( 3a^2 \). Therefore:
\[ PF^2 = 3a^2 - 324. \]
Since \( 3a^2 = 324 + PF^2 \), we can find \( PF^2 \) by:
\[ PF^2 = 3a^2 - 324. \]
Therefore:
\[ PF^2 = 324 - 324 = 0. \]
Thus, the distance \( PF \) is:
\[ PF = \sqrt{0} = 0. \]

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the palla da Jen to that of Jack, we start by using the formula for force, which states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen and Jack are using the same force to launch their pballs, we can set the force \( F \) equal for both Jen and Jack. Let \( a_J \) be the acceleration of the palla da Jen and \( a_K \) be the acceleration of the palla da Jack. The masses of the pballs are \( m_J = 200 \) g for the palla da softball and \( m_K = 150 \) g for the palla da baseball. Therefore, we can write:

\[ F = m_J \cdot a_J \]
\[ F = m_K \cdot a_K \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the right-hand sides of these equations equal to each other:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_K \cdot a_K \]

We need to find the ratio \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \). Substituting the masses, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_K \]

To isolate the ratio \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 150 \cdot a_K \):

\[ \frac{200 \cdot a_J}{150 \cdot a_k} = \frac{150 \cdot a_k}{150 \cdot a_k} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{200}{150} \cdot \frac{a_J}{a_k} = 1 \]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{200}{150} \):

\[ \frac{200}{150} = \frac{4}{3} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{a_J}{a_k} = 1 \]

To solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_k} \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{4}{3} \), which is \( \frac{3}{4} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_k} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the palla da Jen to that of Jack is:

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits in the same positions:

- The first digit (from the right) is 6 in base 7 and 5 in base 8.
- The second digit is 5 in base 7 and 6 in base 8.
- The third digit is 5 in base 7 and 1 in base 8.
- The fourth digit is 6 in base 7 and 1 in base 8.

We see that the digit 1 appears in both representations, but the digit 5 does not appear in both representations. The digit 6 appears in both representations, but the digit 5 does not appear in both representations.

Therefore, the only digit that appears in both representations is 1, and it appears in the same position in both representations.

First, we use the fact that the polynomial can be factored as:
\[x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d).\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd.\]
By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\), we obtain the system of equations:
\[a + c = 2,\]
\[ac + b + d = 0,\]
\[ad + bc = 0,\]
\[bd = 2.\]
We can solve this system step by step. From the fourth equation, we have:
\[d = \frac{2}{b}.\]
Substituting \(d\) into the third equation, we get:
\[a \left(\frac{2}{b}\right) + bc = 0 \implies \frac{2a}{b} + bc = 0 \implies 2a + b^2c = 0 \implies b^2c = -2a.\]
From the second equation, we have:
\[ac + b + \frac{2}{b} = 0 \implies ac + \frac{2}{b} = -b \implies ac = -b - \frac{2}{b}.\]
Now, we substitute \(c = 2 - a\) from the first equation into the equation \(b^2c = -2a\):
\[b^2(2 - a) = -2a \implies 2b^2 - ab^2 = -2a \implies 2b^2 = ab^2 - 2a \implies 2b^2 = a(b^2 - 2).\]
If \(b^2 \neq 2\), then:
\[a = \frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}.\]
Substituting \(a\) into \(c = 2 - a\), we get:
\[c = 2 - \frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2} = \frac{2(b^2 - 2) - 2b^2}{b^2 - 2} = \frac{-4}{b^2 - 2}.\]
Now, substituting \(a\) and \(c\) into \(ac = -b - \frac{2}{b}\), we get:
\[\left(\frac{2b^2}{b^2 - 2}\right)\left(\frac{-4}{b^2 - 2}\right) = -b - \frac{2}{b} \implies \frac{-8b^2}{(b^2 - 2)^2} = -b - \frac{2}{b}.\]
This equation is quite complex to solve directly, so we use the fact that the roots of the polynomial can be expressed in terms of trigonometric functions. The roots of \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) are:
\[\alpha_1 = \sqrt{2} \left( \cos \frac{5\pi}{12} + i \sin \frac{5\pi}{12} \right),\]

"To determine the cost of one matita, we start by defining the variables for the cost of a matita and a gomma jumbo. Let \( m \) be the cost of one matita in dollars and \( g \) be the cost of one gomma jumbo in dollars. According to the problem, we have the following system of equations:

1. \( m + g = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5m + g = 1.82 \)

We can eliminate \( g \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5m + g) - (m + g) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4m = 0.58
\]

To find \( m \), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
m = \frac{0.58}{4} = 0.145
\]

Since we need the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

\[
m = 0.145 \times 100 = 14.5
\]

Therefore, the cost of one matita is \(\boxed{14.5}\) cents.","[14.5000000000000, '14.5']",29,"[29, '29']",False
"To determine the last digit different from zero to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\). Since 137 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 500 other than 1, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

Next, we perform the division of 137 by 500. We can do this by long division or by using a calculator. Using a calculator, we find:

\[
\frac{137}{500} = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last digit different from zero is 4.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). The vertices of the rectangle are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\), where \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The region where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex can be found by considering the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting \(O\) to each vertex. These bisectors will form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\) with center \(O\).

The perpendicular bisector of \(OA\) is the line \(y = x\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OB\) is the line \(y = -x\), the perpendicular bisector of \(OC\) is the line \(y = b - x\), and the perpendicular bisector of \(OD\) is the line \(y = b + x\). These four lines intersect to form a smaller rectangle with vertices at \(\left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\), and \(\left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\).

The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} - \left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right) \left(\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}} - \left(-\frac{a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)\right) = \left(\frac{2a}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = 2a^2
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

Since \(a = kb\), the area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 4kb^2
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of original rectangle}} = \frac{2a^2}{4ab} = \frac{2a}{4b} = \frac{a}{2b} = \frac{k}{2}

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54
\]

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

\[
r = a - bq = 54 - 54 = 0

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents are left after converting the total amount of money into dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money earned by Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie.
2. Convert the total amount from cents to dollars.
3. Determine how many dollars and cents can be converted into whole dollars.
4. Calculate the remaining cents after the conversion.

First, let's find the total amount of money earned:
\[
\text{Total amount} = 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money earned is $126.59.

Next, we convert this total amount into cents. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we convert the total amount into whole dollars. The whole dollar part of $126.59 is $126, which is equivalent to:
\[
126 \times 100 = 12600 \text{ cents}
\]

The remaining cents after converting $126 into whole dollars are:
\[
12659 - 12600 = 59 \text{ cents}

Therefore, the number of cents left after converting the total amount into dollars is \(\boxed{59}\).","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True

"To determine the value of \( n \) for the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since this is a magic square, the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be equal to \( 2n + 1 \). Let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

For the square to be magic, this sum must also be equal to \( 2n + 1 \):

\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \):

\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To confirm that \( n = 7 \) is correct, we will substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

The magic square becomes:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Now, let's verify the sums:

- Sum of the first row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the first column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet Jim saves compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha runs along the length and the width of the field, so the total distance she travels is:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = \text{Length} + \text{Width} = 300 \text{ feet} + 400 \text{ feet} = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim runs diagonally across the field, so the distance he travels is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. We can find the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{Distance Jim travels} = \sqrt{\text{Length}^2 + \text{Width}^2} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance Martha travels} - \text{Distance Jim travels} = 700 \text{ feet} - 500 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression further simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
