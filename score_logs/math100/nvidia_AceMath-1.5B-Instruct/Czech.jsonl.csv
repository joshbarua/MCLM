"To find the length of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given right triangle \(DEF\). We know that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\), \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\), and \(F\) is at \((0, 0)\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(D\) is directly above \(E\) (because both have the same \(y\)-coordinate), the length of \(DE\) is simply the difference in the \(x\)-coordinates of \(D\) and \(E\). The \(x\)-coordinate of \(D\) is \(\sqrt{51}\) and the \(x\)-coordinate of \(E\) is 0. Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \theta \) counterclockwise of a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   \[

   We now perform the multiplication:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. We know that \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), so:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression and simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to match its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon.

To find the minimum number of degrees required for the pentagon to return to its original position, we need to consider the smallest positive angle of rotation that will map the pentagon onto itself. This angle is the smallest multiple of \( 72^\circ \) that is a full rotation, which is \( 360^\circ \).

"To find the value of \( x + y \) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, let's denote the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Since the diagonals bisect each other, this midpoint must be the same as the midpoint we just found:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From this, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Now, we need to find the value of \( x + y \):

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and then sum them up, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \).

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0, \]
\[ \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \)
Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can start by expressing \(99\) as \(100 - 1\). This gives us:

\[
(100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801

Now, we substitute this back into the expression:

\[

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm (or induced norm) of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \):
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \( \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
Thus, the eigenvalues are \( \lambda_1 = 16 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 1 \). The largest eigenvalue is \( 16 \), so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0.\]

Calculating each term, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9,\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8.\]

Adding these values together, we get:

2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[

\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

First, let's expand the product:

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[

Expanding each term, we get:

Next, we combine like terms:

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[

This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:

This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

The tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the rate at which the water level rises. The cross-sectional area of the tank is \( \pi r^2 \), and the rate at which the water level rises is 4 meters per hour. Therefore, the volume of water added per hour can also be expressed as:

\[ \text{Volume rate} = \pi r^2 \times 4 \]

We know that the volume rate is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, so we can set up the following equation:

\[ \pi r^2 \times 4 = 20\pi \]

To solve for \( r^2 \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
For \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards, and it does not intersect the horizontal line \(y = c\) for any \(c > 0\). Therefore, \(a\) must be non-negative.

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). For \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and for \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\). Since \(a\) must be non-negative, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(0\) (when \(a = 0\)). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\) (when \(a > 0\)).

Therefore, we need:
\[ 0 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
This inequality is satisfied for \(a \geq 0\) or \(a \leq -2\). Since \(a\) must be non-negative, we have:
\[ a \geq 0. \]

To find the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to ensure that the line \(y = ax + 2a\) does not intersect the parabola \(y = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). The line \(y = ax + 2a\) intersects the parabola \(y = ax^2\) at:
\[ ax + 2a = ax^2. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ ax^2 - ax - 2a = 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(x^2 - x - 2) = 0. \]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we solve:
\[ x^2 - x - 2 = 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:
\[ (x - 2)(x + 1) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are \(x = 2\) and \(x = -1\). For \(x \geq a\), the line \(y = ax + 2a\) intersects the parabola \(y = ax^2\) at \(x = 2\) if \(a \leq 2\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph intersects every horizontal line at least once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging to match the standard form, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where \( r \) is the radius. We know that the radius \( r \) is 1, so we set \( 34 - c \) equal to \( 1^2 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \), we get:
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\). This inequality is satisfied for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\). Therefore, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let's consider the function \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two cases:
1. \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point and does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\).
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\) has a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). This means that \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Let's analyze the function \(g(x) = \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1\). We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(g(x) = 0\) has a solution in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By examining the behavior of \(g(x)\) and its derivative, we can determine that \(g(x) = 0\) has a solution in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(1 < \lambda < 4\). For \(\lambda = 1\) and \(\lambda = 4\), the fixed points are the same, and \(g(x) = 0\) does not have a solution in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To find the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) in degrees such that \(\tan \theta\) equals the given expression, we start by simplifying the expression on the right-hand side. The expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine and cosine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator can be rewritten as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we get:

\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]

So, the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

The denominator can be rewritten as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ.
\]

So, the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula \(\tan (A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\) with \(A = 65^\circ\) and \(B = 5^\circ\):

\[
\tan 70^\circ = \frac{\tan 65^\circ + \tan 5^\circ}{1 - \tan 65^\circ \tan 5^\circ}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the given expression is equal to \(\tan 15^\circ\):

\[
\tan 15^\circ = \frac{\sin 15^\circ}{\cos 15^\circ} = \frac{\sin (45^\circ - 30^\circ)}{\cos (45^\circ - 30^\circ)} = \frac{\sin 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ}{\cos 45^\circ \cos 30^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \sin 30^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}}{\frac{\sqrt{6}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{(\sqrt{6} - \sqrt{2})^2}{(\sqrt{6})^2 - (\sqrt{2})^2} = \frac{6 - 2\sqrt{12} + 2}{6 - 2} = \frac{8 - 4\sqrt{3}}{4} = 2 - \sqrt{3}.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letters I, P, S is 1 each.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

First, we calculate \( 7! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function's symmetry and possible critical points.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points.

The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.

Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[

\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.

From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
\sqrt{(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2)} = xy.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0,

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.

From the second equation, we can solve for \( x \):
\[
\sqrt{(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2)} = xy.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.

Thus, the critical points satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Since \( x \ge y \), we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) where \( 0 \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2} \).

\[

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( \cos\theta \), we get:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The corresponding value of \( \sin\theta \) can be found using the Pythagorean identity \( \sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1 \):

\[ \sin^2\theta = 1 - \cos^2\theta = 1 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16} = 1 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{16 - 6 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16} = \frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{8}. \]

Thus,

\[ \sin\theta = \pm \sqrt{\frac{5 - \sqrt{5}}{8}}. \]

Therefore, \( z \) can be written as:

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the property of exponents, we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \theta = \arccos\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right) \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \). Since \( \cos\left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos\left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we have two cases to consider.

If \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \), then \( 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi \), and

\[ \cos(34\pi) = \cos(0) = 1. \]

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(34\pi) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(68\pi) = 2 \cdot 1 = 2. \]

In both cases, we get the same result. Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

First, let's recall that the centroid \( G \) of a triangle \( ABC \) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

Since the line through \( G \) is parallel to \( BC \), triangles \( AGM \) and \( AGN \) are similar to triangle \( ABC \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of these similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from \( A \) to the parallel line and from \( A \) to \( BC \).

The distance from \( A \) to the parallel line is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \) because \( G \) divides the median \( AD \) in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AGM \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

Since the area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its sides, the area of triangle \( AGM \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

Similarly, the area of triangle \( AGN \) is also \( \frac{1}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

The area of triangle \( AGM \) and triangle \( AGN \) together is \( \frac{1}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = \frac{2}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).

The area of triangle \( ABC \) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle \( AGM \) and triangle \( AGN \) together is:
\[
\frac{2}{9} \times 144 = \frac{288}{9} = 32
\]

The area of triangle \( EFG \) is the remaining part of the area of triangle \( ABC \) after subtracting the area of triangles \( AGM \) and \( AGN \). Since the area of triangle \( EFG \) is the area of triangle \( ABC \) minus the area of triangles \( AGM \) and \( AGN \), we have:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle EFG = 144 - 32 = 112
\]

Thus, the area of triangle \( EFG \) is:
\[

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{1}{3}\):

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = \frac{195}{3} = 65 \]

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the fourth term \(a_4 = 200\) and the eighth term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write the following equations:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the fourth term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

Now that we have the first term and the common difference, we can find the sixth term \(a_6\) using the general formula:

\[ a_6 = a_1 + 5d \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 5(75) \]
\[ a_6 = -25 + 375 \]
\[ a_6 = 350 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit numbers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the common divisors of these two numbers. Let's start by finding the prime factorizations of 100 and 150.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are \(2\) and \(5^2\). Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:
\[ \text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2 \times 5^2 = 50 \]

Next, we need to find all the divisors of 50 that are two-digit numbers. First, let's list all the divisors of 50:

"To determine for which positive integer \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} = k^n \) for some integer \( k \). This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \), because the exponent of 2 on the left side of the equation is 24, and the exponent of 2 on the right side is \( n \log_2 k \), which must be an integer.

Therefore, we need to find all divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are the positive integers that divide 24 without leaving a remainder. We can list them by checking each positive integer up to 24:

- Let \( x \) be the number of pěticentové mince.
- Let \( y \) be the number of desetníkové mince.

From the problem, we know two things:
1. Hillary has a total of 11 mincí.
2. The total value of the mincí is 75 centů.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 0.1x + 0.1y = 0.75 \) (since each pěticentové mince is worth 10 centů and each desetníkové mince is worth 10 centů, the total value in cents is \( 10x + 10y = 75 \) or \( 0.1x + 0.1y = 0.75 \))

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse each select from the first six prime numbers is odd, we first identify the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

A sum of two numbers is odd if one number is odd and the other is even. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Paul and Jesse each select one of these six numbers. The total number of possible outcomes when both Paul and Jesse select a number is \(6 \times 6 = 36\).

To find the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is odd, we need to count the outcomes where Paul selects an even number and Jesse selects an odd number, and the outcomes where Paul selects an odd number and Jesse selects an even number.

1. Paul selects an even number and Jesse selects an odd number:
   - Paul has 1 choice (2) and Jesse has 5 choices (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).
   - The number of outcomes is \(1 \times 5 = 5\).

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include all the prime factors of 450 in its factorization. Therefore, the number must have at least one factor of 2, one factor of 9, and two factors of 5.

Next, we need to find the smallest number whose digits are all zeros and ones that contains these factors. The number must end in 0 to be divisible by 2, and it must end in 000 to be divisible by 100 (since \(5^2 = 25\) and we need two factors of 5, which means the number must end in at least two zeros). Additionally, the number must be divisible by 9, which means the sum of its digits must be divisible by 9. The smallest number composed of zeros and ones that has a sum of digits divisible by 9 is 111111111 (since \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\)).

Combining these conditions, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 111111111000. Let's verify this:

- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- It ends in 000, so it is divisible by 100.
- The sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 9\), so it is divisible by 9.

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - The first number is divided by 4, and the remainder can be 1, 2, 3. This means there are 4 possible remainders.
   - The second number is divided by 5, and the remainder can be 1, 2, 3, 4. This means there are 5 possible remainders.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The figure is placed on the central square of the chessboard. The central square is the intersection of the 3rd row and the 3rd column.
   - For the first number, the remainder when divided by 4 must be 1 (since the 3rd row corresponds to the remainder 1, 2, 3, and 4 is not possible).
   - For the second number, the remainder when divided by 5 must be 2 (since the 3rd column corresponds to the remainder 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 is not possible).

"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[
\frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

\[ x = r \cos \theta, \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta, \]
\[ z = z. \]

The equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates directly translates to the same equation in Cartesian coordinates:

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015. \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by substituting \( x+5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[ g(x) = f(x+5) = (x+5)^3 - 49(x+5)^2 + 623(x+5) - 2015. \]

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( g(r-5) = f((r-5)+5) = f(r) = 0 \).

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 70^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for angles \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) such that \(A + C = 2B\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 B \left( \frac{\sin^2 (A-B) + \sin^2 (B-C) + \sin^2 (C-A)}{\cos^2 A \cos^2 B \cos^2 C} \right).
\]

In our case, \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 40^\circ\), and \(C = 70^\circ\), so \(A + C = 80^\circ = 2 \times 40^\circ = 2B\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 (-30^\circ) + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} \right).
\]

Since \(\sin (-x) = -\sin x\), we have \(\sin^2 (-30^\circ) = \sin^2 30^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\). Therefore, the expression inside the parentheses becomes:

\[
\frac{\sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ + \sin^2 30^\circ}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\cos^2 10^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ \cos^2 70^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity for the product of cosines of angles in arithmetic progression that:

\[
\cos 10^\circ \cos 40^\circ \cos 70^\circ = \frac{\sin 80^\circ}{8 \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{\cos 10^\circ}{8 \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{8 \tan 10^\circ}.

Therefore, we have:

Substituting this back, we get:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{\frac{3}{4}}{\frac{1}{64 \tan^2 10^\circ}} \right) = \tan^2 40^\circ \left( \frac{3}{4} \times 64 \tan^2 10^\circ \right) = 48 \tan^2 10^\circ \tan^2 40^\circ.

   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles in terms of the given sum and the unknown angle:**
   Let the unknown interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the other \(n-1\) interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the total sum of the interior angles can also be written as:

3. **Set up the equation and solve for \(n\):**
   Equate the two expressions for the total sum of the interior angles:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + x
   \]
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can find the range for \(n\) by considering the maximum possible value for \(x\), which is just less than \(180^\circ\). For simplicity, we can use \(x = 180^\circ - \epsilon\) where \(\epsilon\) is a very small positive number, but for practical purposes, we can approximate:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1070^\circ + 180^\circ

   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ \approx 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 \approx \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 \approx 6.9444

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

\[ t \equiv -1 - 5 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv -6 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic unit, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of one side of the cube.
2. Calculate the surface area of the cube.

**Step 1: Determine the length of one side of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the length of one side of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic unit, we have:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the surface area of the cube.**

The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = 6s^2 \]
Since \( s = 1 \), we substitute this value into the formula:
\[ A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \times 1 = 6 \]

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Calculating the squares, we have:

\[
5^2 = 25 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

Subtracting these values, we get:

"The given sequence is a sequence of odd numbers: 1, 3, 5, 7, ...

This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

For this sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

\[ a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[ a_n = 1 + 2(n-1) \]
\[ a_n = 1 + 2n - 2 \]
\[ a_n = 2n - 1 \]

We need to find the 2003rd term of the sequence, so we substitute \(n = 2003\) into the formula:

\[ a_{2003} = 2 \cdot 2003 - 1 \]

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we proceed to step 3. The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]

Setting this equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

Thus, the solutions to the equation are:
\[
x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}.
\]

We need to check if these solutions are valid. Since \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) are defined for all real \(x\), both solutions are valid.

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first need to verify that the lines are indeed parallel. Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these points is

\[
\mathbf{r}_2(0) - \mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The distance between two parallel lines is the length of the projection of this vector onto the cross product of the direction vectors. However, since the direction vectors are parallel, their cross product is the zero vector. Instead, we can use the fact that the distance between two parallel lines is the length of the vector connecting a point on one line to a point on the other line, divided by the magnitude of the direction vector.

The magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\) is

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

A point \((x,y)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle if its coordinates satisfy the inequalities:
\[
-5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4.

This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

First, we count the number of possible values for \(x\). The integers from \(-4\) to \(4\) are:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we get

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

Combining these results, we have

Using these values, we substitute into the expression:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a lichoběžník with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the angles in the quadrilateral. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we have \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Let \(\angle BAD = 2\theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\).

Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\angle BCD = \angle BAD = 2\theta\). The quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be divided into two triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of these two triangles:
\[
[ABCD] = [ABC] + [ACD].
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
[ABC] + [ACD] = 42.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD.
\]

To find the area of \(\triangle ABC\), we use the fact that \(\angle BAC = \theta\) and \(\angle BCA = 90^\circ - \theta\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin(\angle BAC) = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \theta.
\]

However, we can also express the area of \(\triangle ABC\) in terms of the area of \(\triangle ACD\) and the fact that \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Since \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. Therefore, the ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. The corresponding sides are \(AB\) and \(AD\), and since \(\overline{AC}\) is the common height, the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases \(AB\) and \(AD\).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the sum of the areas of the two triangles is 42 and that \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both triangles and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of the triangles are proportional to the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\). But since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), the areas of the triangles are equal. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the quadrilateral:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21.
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\boxed{21}.

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[

   \]

2. **Eliminate the fraction by cross-multiplying:**
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides by \(-19\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19} = \frac{9}{19}

5. **Verify the solution by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:**
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To find the zjednodušená hodnota \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we start by using the definition of the operation @, which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)

To simplify this, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

\[

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can use geometric probability and combinatorial arguments.

First, consider the circle and the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on it. The line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

There are \(4!\) (24) possible permutations of the four points. However, since the circle has no starting point, each unique arrangement of points is counted 4 times (once for each starting point). Therefore, there are \(\frac{4!}{4} = 6\) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points are in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements:
\[
\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the overlapping region of two circles with centers \(D\) and radii 1 and 2 is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the overlapping region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the overlapping region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine the area of the overlapping region in terms of the angle \(\angle ADC\). The overlapping region consists of two segments of the circles. The area of a segment of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of a segment} = \text{Area of the sector} - \text{Area of the triangle}
\]

For the smaller circle with radius 1, the area of the sector subtended by \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi
\]
The area of the triangle in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]
Thus, the area of the segment in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

For the larger circle with radius 2, the area of the sector subtended by \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} 4\pi
\]
The area of the triangle in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Thus, the area of the segment in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} 4\pi - 2 \sin \theta
\]

The total area of the overlapping region is the sum of the areas of the segments in both circles:
\[
\text{Total area of the overlapping region} = \left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \right) + \left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} 4\pi - 2 \sin \theta \right) = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} 5\pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} 5\pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Dividing both sides by 5\(\pi\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2\pi} \sin \theta = \frac{1}{3\pi}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2\(\pi\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{180^\circ} - \sin \theta = \frac{2}{3}
\]
We need to find \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By trial and error or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = 120^\circ\) is a solution:
\[
\frac{120^\circ}{180^\circ} - \sin 120^\circ = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx \frac{2}{3} - 0.866 = \frac{2}{3} - \frac{2}{3} = 0

"To determine how many cylindrical containers are needed to fill a spherical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical and spherical containers and then find the ratio of the volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical container, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Therefore, the volume is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical container. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical container, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Therefore, the volume is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we find the number of cylindrical containers needed to fill the spherical container by dividing the volume of the spherical container by the volume of one cylindrical container:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical containers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical containers needed to fill the spherical container is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

2. Convert the speed from stops per second to palcích per second.

Next, we need to convert the speed from stops per second to palcích per second. Since 1 stop is equal to 1 palch, the speed in palcích per second is the same as the speed in stops per second:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that do not meet the criteria (i.e., subcommittees that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members (8 republikán + 6 demokrat):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the republikán party:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the demokrat party:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

Now, add the number of ways to choose 5 members all from one party:
\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract this number from the total number of subcommittees to get the number of subcommittees that include at least one member from each party:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find three consecutive integers whose product is 120 and whose average is 24. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120:
\[
x(x+1)(x+2) = 120
\]

Next, we know that the average of these three integers is 24:
\[
\frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = 24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
\frac{3x + 3}{3} = 24
\]
\[
x + 1 = 24
\]
\[
x = 23
\]

So, the three consecutive integers are 23, 24, and 25. Let's verify that their product is indeed 120:
\[
23 \times 24 \times 25
\]
First, calculate \(23 \times 24\):
\[
23 \times 24 = 552
\]
Next, multiply the result by 25:
\[
552 \times 25 = 13800
\]
It seems there was a miscalculation. Let's recheck the problem constraints and calculations.

Given the correct product is 120, let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to solve the polynomial equation \(x(x+1)(x+2) = 120\) directly. Expanding the left side, we get:
\[
x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x = 120
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
x^3 + 3x^2 + 2x - 120 = 0
\]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \(x = 5\):
\[
5^3 + 3(5^2) + 2(5) - 120 = 125 + 75 + 10 - 120 = 90 \quad \text{(not a root)}
\]
Testing \(x = 6\):
\[
6^3 + 3(6^2) + 2(6) - 120 = 216 + 108 + 12 - 120 = 216 \quad \text{(not a root)}
\]
Testing \(x = 4\):
\[
4^3 + 3(4^2) + 2(4) - 120 = 64 + 48 + 8 - 120 = 0 \quad \text{(a root)}
\]

So, \(x = 4\) is a root. The three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6. Let's verify their product:
\[
4 \times 5 \times 6 = 120
\]
And their average:
\[
\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = \frac{15}{3} = 5
\]

There was a miscalculation in the problem statement. The correct average should be 5, not 24.

"To find the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \( 16^3 \):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \( x^2 - 4x + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \( x \), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \( 4096 = 64^2 \), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \( x - 2 = 64 \)
2. \( x - 2 = -64 \)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \( x \), we discard \( x = -62 \) and keep \( x = 66 \).

Therefore, the positive value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation is:

\[

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
In our case, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.
\]
Therefore, the original expression is:
\[
-\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = -\left( -\frac{1}{16} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 121 + BM^2 \]

Similarly, for \( \triangle AMC \):
\[ AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 11^2 + CM^2 \]
\[ AC^2 = 121 + CM^2 \]

Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[ 121 + BM^2 = 121 + CM^2 \]
\[ BM^2 = CM^2 \]
\[ BM = CM \]

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \):
\[ BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 \]
\[ BD^2 = BM^2 + 1^2 \]
\[ BD^2 = BM^2 + 1 \]

Using the right triangle \( \triangle CDM \):
\[ CD^2 = CM^2 + DM^2 \]
\[ CD^2 = CM^2 + 1^2 \]
\[ CD^2 = CM^2 + 1 \]

Since \( BM = CM \), we have:
\[ BD^2 = CD^2 \]
\[ BD = CD \]

Now, we use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD} = \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} \]

Since \( BD = CD \), \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD \). Therefore:
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} \]

Using the triple angle identity for sine:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \]

Let \( \sin \theta = x \). Then:
\[ \sin 3\theta = 3x - 4x^3 \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ \frac{AB}{\sin \angle AMB} = \frac{AM}{\sin \angle ABM} \]
\[ \frac{AB}{\sin 90^\circ} = \frac{11}{\sin \angle ABM} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\sin \angle ABM} \]

Since \( \angle ABM = 90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2} \):
\[ \sin \angle ABM = \cos \frac{\theta}{2} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \]

Using the double angle identity for cosine:
\[ \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos \theta}{2}} \]

Since \( \cos \theta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \):
\[ \cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{2}} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11}{\sqrt{\frac{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}{2}}} \]
\[ AB = \frac{11 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}} \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} \]
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{BC}{3x - 4x^3} \]

Since \( BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + 1} \):
\[ \frac{\sqrt{BM^2 + 1}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{BC}{3x - 4x^3} \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BAC} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ACB} \]
\[ \frac{BC}{x} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ACB} \]

Since \( \angle ACB = 180^\circ - 2\theta \):
\[ \sin \angle ACB = \sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
\[ \frac{BC}{x} = \frac{AB}{2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
\[ BC = \frac{AB}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]

Substituting \( AB \):
\[ BC = \frac{\frac{11 \sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}}}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
\[ BC = \frac{11 \sqrt{2}}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}} \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{\sqrt{BM^2 + 1}}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\frac{11 \sqrt{2}}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} \sqrt{1 + \sqrt{1 - x^2}}}}{3x - 4x^3} \]

Solving for \( x \):
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \]

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{2} \):
\[ \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ \theta = 30^\circ \]

Therefore:
\[ \angle BAC = 30^\circ \]
\[ \angle BDC = 90^\circ \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{AB}{\sin 120^\circ} \]
\[ \frac{BC}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{AB}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} \]
\[ BC = \frac{AB}{\sqrt{3}} \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{BC}{\sin 90^\circ} \]
\[ \frac{BD}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{BC}{1} \]
\[ BD = \frac{BC}{2} \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{CD}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{BC}{\sin 90^\circ} \]
\[ \frac{CD}{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{BC}{1} \]
\[ CD = \frac{BC}{2} \]

Therefore:
\[ BC = 11 \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[ \frac{AB}{\sin 120^\circ} = \frac{11}{\sin 30^\circ} \]
\[ \frac{AB}{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}} = \frac{11}{\frac{1}{2}} \]
\[ AB = 11 \sqrt{3} \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BD}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{11}{\sin 90^\circ} \]
\[ \frac{BD}{\frac{1}{2}} = 11 \]
\[ BD = 5.5 \]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{CD}{\sin 30^\circ} = \frac{11}{\sin 90^\circ} \]
\[ \frac{CD}{\frac{1}{2}} = 11 \]
\[ CD = 5.5 \]

Therefore:
\[ BC = 11 \]
\[ AB = 11 \sqrt{3} \]
\[ AC = 11 \sqrt{3} \]

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ AB + BC + AC = 11 \sqrt{3} + 11 + 11 \sqrt{3} = 11 + 22 \sqrt{3} \]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\):

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now, substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine the ročník in which the number of male students riding bicycles is closest to 135% of the number of female students riding bicycles, we need to calculate the ratio of male to female students riding bicycles for each ročník and then compare these ratios to 1.35.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female students riding bicycles for each ročník:

1. **9th ročník:**
   - Number of male students riding bicycles: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of female students riding bicycles: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.041\)

2. **10th ročník:**
   - Number of male students riding bicycles: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Number of female students riding bicycles: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.039\)

3. **11th ročník:**
   - Number of male students riding bicycles: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of female students riding bicycles: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.500\)

4. **12th ročník:**
   - Number of male students riding bicycles: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of female students riding bicycles: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.356\)

Now, we compare these ratios to 1.35:
- The ratio for the 9th ročník is approximately 1.041, which is far from 1.35.
- The ratio for the 10th ročník is approximately 1.039, which is far from 1.35.
- The ratio for the 11th ročník is approximately 1.500, which is far from 1.35.
- The ratio for the 12th ročník is approximately 1.356, which is very close to 1.35.

Therefore, the ročník in which the number of male students riding bicycles is closest to 135% of the number of female students riding bicycles is the \(\boxed{12}\)th ročník.","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. **Interval \((-\infty, -9)\):**
   Choose \(x = -10\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-10)^2 - 81|}{(-10)(-10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(-10)(-46)} = \frac{19}{460} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

2. **Interval \((-9, 0)\):**
   Choose \(x = -1\).
   \[
   \frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

3. **Interval \((0, 9)\):**
   Choose \(x = 1\).
   \[
   \frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

4. **Interval \((9, 36)\):**
   Choose \(x = 10\).
   \[
   \frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0.
   \]
   The expression is negative in this interval.

5. **Interval \((36, \infty)\):**
   Choose \(x = 37\).
   \[
   \frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0.
   \]
   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 36\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]
In interval notation, the solution is:
\[
\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.

"To determine the maximum possible area of the oblique field, we need to analyze the given information and the shape of the field. The field is a rectangle with two semicircles at the ends, forming a complete circle when combined. The total length of the track is 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle.

Let's denote the length of each straight side by \( L \) and the radius of the semicircles by \( R \). The circumference of the circle is \( 2\pi R \). Therefore, the total length of the track can be expressed as:
\[
2L + 2\pi R = 400
\]
We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[
L + \pi R = 200
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( R \), we get:
\[
L = 200 - \pi R
\]

The area \( A \) of the field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the area of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times 2R \) (since the width of the rectangle is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is \( 2R \)), and the area of the two semicircles is the area of one full circle, which is \( \pi R^2 \). Therefore, the total area is:
\[
A = L \times 2R + \pi R^2
\]
Substituting \( L = 200 - \pi R \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = (200 - \pi R) \times 2R + \pi R^2
\]
Expanding and simplifying the expression, we have:
\[
A = 400R - 2\pi R^2 + \pi R^2
\]
\[
A = 400R - \pi R^2
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( R \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dR} = 400 - 2\pi R
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
400 - 2\pi R = 0
\]
\[
2\pi R = 400
\]
\[
R = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( R = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)
\]
\[
L = 200 - 200
\]
\[
L = 0
\]

This result indicates that the straight sides of the rectangle are zero, which is not possible for a field. Therefore, we need to consider the constraints and the shape of the field more carefully. The correct interpretation is that the field is a rectangle with two semicircles at the ends, and the total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle.

The correct approach is to consider the field as a rectangle with two semicircles at the ends, and the total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle. The correct maximum area is achieved when the field is a square, where the length of each side is \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) meters.

The area of the field is:
\[
A = 100 \times 100 = 10000
\]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the field is:

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\), we start by noting that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{RS}{RT}\), so we have:

\[
\frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Given that \(RT = 5\), we can find \(RS\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
RS = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the other leg \(ST\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Therefore, we have:

\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]

Substituting the known values of \(RT\) and \(RS\):

\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]

\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]

Subtracting 4 from both sides:

\[
ST^2 = 21
\]

Taking the square root of both sides:

\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:

\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

"To find the nearest distance from the origin to a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \( D \) between these two points is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we can minimize \( D^2 \) instead, which is a simpler function:

\[ D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the function becomes:

\[ f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the minimum value of \( f(u) \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:

\[ f'(u) = u - 2 \]
\[ u - 2 = 0 \]
\[ u = 2 \]

Substituting \( u = 2 \) back into the function \( f(u) \):

\[ f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(2) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(2) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(2) = -2 + \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(2) = \frac{-4 + 9}{2} \]
\[ f(2) = \frac{5}{2} \]

So, the minimum value of \( D^2 \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \), and therefore the minimum value of \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a \) is not divisible by the square of any other integer greater than 1, the sum \( a + b \) is:

\[ a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \]

Thus, the answer is:

\[ \boxed{12} \]","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular tetrahedron, we start by noting that the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices be \( d_6 \) and \( d_7 \).

The sum of the squares of the distances from a point inside a regular tetrahedron to its vertices is constant and equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices plus four times the square of the distance from the point to the centroid. However, for a regular tetrahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the tetrahedron to its vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices plus four times the square of the distance from the point to the centroid. This sum is constant and equal to \( 4 \times \left(\frac{3}{4} \times \text{edge length}^2\right) = 3 \times \text{edge length}^2 \).

Given that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices is \( 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \), the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is \( 324 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 \).

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular tetrahedron to its vertices is constant, we have:
\[ 324 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 = 3 \times \text{edge length}^2 \]

However, we do not need the edge length to find \( d_6 \) and \( d_7 \). Instead, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is constant. Therefore, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular tetrahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the centroid to the vertices plus four times the square of the distance from the point to the centroid.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices is 324, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is 324 plus the square of the distance to the sixth vertex. Therefore, the distance to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine the poměr zrychlení míče Jen k Jackovu, we start with the given information that the force is equal to the mass times the acceleration (F = ma). Since the forces are equal, we can set the force on the softball equal to the force on the baseball.

Let's denote the zrychlení míče Jen as \(a_J\) and the zrychlení míče Jack as \(a_C\). The mass of the softball is \(m_S = 200\) g and the mass of the baseball is \(m_B = 150\) g. The force on both objects is the same, so we can write:

\[ m_S a_S = m_B a_C \]

Since the force is the same, we can also write:

\[ m_S a_J = m_B a_C \]

We need to find the ratio of \(a_J\) to \(a_C\):

"To determine how many common digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Identify the common digits
Now, we compare the digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations. The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\).

The digits in base 7 are: \(1, 5, 6\)
The digits in base 8 are: \(1, 6, 5\)

"To determine the total number of rukos that occurred on the magical chessboard, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 6 chessboards and 10 chessboards.
2. Each chessboard has 6 rows and 10 columns.
3. Each row and each column on a chessboard contains exactly one chessboard.
4. Each chessboard has 6 rows and 10 columns, so there are \(6 \times 10 = 60\) squares on each chessboard.
5. Each chessboard has 6 rows and 10 columns, so there are \(6 \times 10 = 60\) squares on each chessboard.
6. Each chessboard has 6 rows and 10 columns, so there are \(6 \times 10 = 60\) squares on each chessboard.

Since each chessboard has 6 rows and 10 columns, there are \(6 \times 10 = 60\) squares on each chessboard. Therefore, the total number of rukos that occurred on the chessboard is \(6 \times 10 = 60\).

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by noting that \( g(x) \) is the polynomial \( f(x-1) \). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[
g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0).
\]

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[
f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2.
\]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True

According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]
For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. From Vieta's formulas, we know:

Thus, we have:

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). Using the identity for the product of the sums of products of roots, we have:

Thus, we have:
\[

We now have the system of equations:

1. \( 3t + g = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5t + g = 1.82 \)

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The vertices are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the regions defined by the inequalities:
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, A), \]
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, B), \]
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, C), \]
\[ d(P, O) < d(P, D). \]

These inequalities describe the regions inside the rectangle that are closer to \(O\) than to any vertex. The boundary of each region is the perpendicular bisector of the segment joining \(O\) to the corresponding vertex. These perpendicular bisectors form a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to the sides of \(ABCD\).

The smaller rectangle is similar to the original rectangle \(ABCD\) and has side lengths that are half of the side lengths of \(ABCD\). Therefore, the area of the smaller rectangle is:

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[ AB \times AD. \]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[ \frac{\text{Area of smaller rectangle}}{\text{Area of original rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{1}{4} \times \text{Area of } ABCD}{\text{Area of } ABCD} = \frac{1}{4}. \]

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the values of the three terms:

2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 = 12659 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many cents were converted to dollars and how many cents were left. Since the problem states that they converted the minimum number of cents to dollars, we need to find the largest multiple of 100 that is less than or equal to 12659.

\[
12659 \div 100 = 126.59
\]

The largest integer less than or equal to 126.59 is 126. Therefore, they converted \(126 \times 100 = 12600\) cents to dollars, leaving \(12659 - 12600 = 59\) cents.

Thus, the number of cents that zůstalo poté, co vyměnily co nejvíce mincí za bankovky, is \(\boxed{59}\).","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the arithmetic mean (average) score of the students in the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for each group of students.
2. Sum these total scores to get the overall total score.
3. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students.

Let's start with the first step:

- 20 students scored 80 points each. So, the total score for this group is:
  \[
  20 \times 80 = 1600
  \]

- 8 students scored 90 points each. So, the total score for this group is:
  \[
  8 \times 90 = 720
  \]

- 2 students scored 100 points each. So, the total score for this group is:
  \[
  2 \times 100 = 200
  \]

Next, we sum these total scores to get the overall total score:
\[
1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
\]

Now, we divide the overall total score by the total number of students, which is 30:
\[
\frac{2520}{30} = 84
\]

Therefore, the arithmetic mean score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given magic square is:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3+3+n+1 = 2n+1
\]
So, the common sum \( S \) is \( 2n+1 \).

Next, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2+2n-9+1 = 3n-6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n-6 = 2n+1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n-2n = 1+6 \implies n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify this by calculating the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2+n+n-1 = 2n+1
\]
This sum is also \( 2n+1 \), which matches \( S \).

Next, let's verify the sums of the columns. The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n-3+n+2+2 = 2n+1
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3+2n-9+n = 3n-6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n-6 = 2n+1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n-2n = 1+6 \implies n = 7
\]

The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n+1+1+n-1 = 2n+1
\]
This sum is also \( 2n+1 \), which matches \( S \).

Finally, let's verify the sums of the diagonals. The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n-3+2n-9+n-1 = 4n-13
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
4n-13 = 2n+1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
4n-2n = 1+13 \implies 2n = 14 \implies n = 7
\]

The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n+1+2n-9+2 = 3n-6
\]
For the square to be magic, this sum must equal \( S \):
\[
3n-6 = 2n+1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n-2n = 1+6 \implies n = 7
\]

Since all the sums are equal to \( 2n+1 \) when \( n = 7 \), the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many fewer stops Jim makes than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim jogs diagonally across the rectangle. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ stops}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha walks along the length and the width of the rectangle. The total distance she travels is:
\[
300 + 400 = 700 \text{ stops}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha travels and the distance Jim travels:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ stops}
\]

Therefore, Jim ujde \(\boxed{200}\) stops méně než Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) where \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to evaluate the expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]
To combine these fractions, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest distance that can be traveled to visit all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) starting from any point and returning to the starting point, we need to consider the perimeter of the quadrilateral formed by these points. The quadrilateral is \(ABCD\), and the distances between the points are given as follows:
- \(AB = 6\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(CD = 4\)
- \(DA = 5\)

The shortest distance that can be traveled to visit all four points and return to the starting point is the perimeter of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). The perimeter is the sum of the lengths of all its sides:
