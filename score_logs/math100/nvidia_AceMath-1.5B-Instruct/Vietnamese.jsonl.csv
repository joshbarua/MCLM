"To find the length \( DE \) in the given right triangle \( \triangle DEF \), we start by noting that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and the length of \( EF \) is 7. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \( \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} \).

Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we can set up the following equation:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \( DF \), we solve for \( DF \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DF \) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \( DF \) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values of \( DF \) and \( EF \) into the equation, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To find \( DE^2 \), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   This is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \).
   \[
   z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]

2. **Rotate the translated complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} = \cos \theta + i \sin \theta \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method) to expand this product:
   \[
   \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} + i \frac{2}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i^2 \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})(-1) \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + (3\sqrt{2} - 6)i \frac{1}{2} + (-3\sqrt{2} + 6) \frac{1}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \right)i + \left( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} + 3 \right)

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{1 - 6i}\).","[-1*6*i + 1, '1 - 6i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",False
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. The square root of \(11^2\) is 11, and the square root of 2 is \(\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, we have:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas always sit together, we can treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them around a circular table is \((6-1)! = 5!\).

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. There are \(3!\) ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block.

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas always sit together is:
\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720

Thus, the answer is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.
\]

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 8 is divided by 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]

Now, multiply these remainders together:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24.
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular polygon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to consider the concept of rotational symmetry. A regular polygon with \( n \) sides can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \) and still look the same. This is because a full rotation of \( 360^\circ \) divided by the number of sides \( n \) gives the smallest angle of rotation that will map the polygon onto itself.

For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \). Therefore, the minimum angle of rotation is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To find the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct coordinates should be \((x, y)\) such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. The correct calculation should be re-evaluated with the correct constraints. The correct answer should be:

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and their sum for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = 7: \quad 2(7) = 14 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Numerator at } x = -2: \quad 2(-2) = -4 \quad (\text{not zero})
   \]
   Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the values of \( n \) and \( m \):
   - If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
   - If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
   - If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   For the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator \( n \) is 1 and the degree of the denominator \( m \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Find the sum \( a + b + c \):**

\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16).

Thus, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base \(9\), we first need to convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\), perform the subtraction in base \(10\), and then convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)
The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]
Adding these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]
So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8

Adding these values together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)
Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[
53 - 17 = 36

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\)
To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, we need a common denominator to combine the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewriting the second fraction with this common denominator, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

We can cancel one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks have the same total weight as one squig. We are given two pieces of information:

1. One treeks and one goolee have the same weight as three squigs and one goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee have the same weight as one squig.

Let's denote the weight of a treeks as \( T \) and the weight of a goolee as \( G \).

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ T + G = 3T + G \]

To simplify this equation, we can subtract \( G \) from both sides:
\[ T = 3T \]

Next, we subtract \( T \) from both sides:
\[ 0 = 2T \]

This implies that:
\[ T = 0 \]

So, the weight of one treeks is 0. Now, let's use the second piece of information to verify this result:
\[ 2T + G = T \]

Substituting \( T = 0 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 2(0) + G = 0 \]
\[ G = 0 \]

So, the weight of one goolee is also 0. Since both the weight of a treeks and a goolee are 0, the weight of any number of treeks is also 0. Therefore, the number of treeks that have the same total weight as one squig is any number, but the problem asks for a specific number, which is 1.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product of the two polynomials and then compare the coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of this expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) is \(12\), which matches.
2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) is \(3b + 20\), which must equal \(26\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
   \]
3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) is \(-6 + 5b + 4a\), which must equal \(-8\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   -6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 10 + 4a = -8 \implies 4 + 4a = -8 \implies 4a = -12 \implies a = -3
   \]
4. The coefficient of \(t\) is \(-10 + ab\), which must equal \(-16\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   -10 + (-3)(2) = -16 \implies -10 - 6 = -16 \implies -16 = -16

   This is true.
5. The constant term is \(-2a\), which must equal \(6\). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   -2(-3) = 6 \implies 6 = 6

   This is true.

Since all the coefficients match, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

2. **Determine the rate at which the water level is rising:**
   The problem also states that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour.

3. **Use the formula for the volume of a cylinder:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

4. **Relate the rate of volume increase to the rate of height increase:**
   Since the volume is increasing at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour and the height is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour, we can write:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects any horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval is \(f(a) = a^3\).

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\). The value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) is \(-\infty\), and as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, the value is \(f(a^-) = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect any horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is less than or equal to zero. Testing the intervals \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\), we find that the expression is non-positive in the intervals \([-1, 0]\) and \([0, 2]\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[ -1 \leq a \leq 2. \]
The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) that makes the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by \(-1\):
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the circle have a radius of 1 is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (provided that \(0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\), which is true for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(y) = x\). Since \(f(x) \neq x\), \(y \neq x\). Therefore, we need to solve the system:
\[
f(x) = y \quad \text{and} \quad f(y) = x.
\]
Substituting \(y = f(x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = x.
\]
This means that \(x\) and \(y\) are points that map to each other under \(f\). Let's consider the case when \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Then:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, and it does not satisfy \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Let's consider the case when \(x = 1\). Then:
\[
f(1) = \lambda \cdot 1 \cdot (1 - 1) = 0.
\]
And:
\[
f(0) = \lambda \cdot 0 \cdot (1 - 0) = 0.
\]
So, \(f(f(1)) = 0 \neq 1\), but \(f(1) \neq 1\). Therefore, \(x = 1\) is a solution.

Now, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). From the above analysis, we see that \(\lambda = 1\) is a critical value. For \(\lambda = 1\), \(f(x) = x(1 - x)\) has fixed points at \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The point \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) satisfies \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(\lambda > 1\), the function \(f(x)\) has a maximum value of \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) at \(x = \frac{\lambda}{2}\). If \(\frac{\lambda}{4} \ge 1\), i.e., \(\lambda \ge 4\), then \(f(x) \le 1\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), and the only fixed point is \(x = 0\). In this case, there is no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 1\).

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
The smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\) is:
\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we first identify the letters and their frequencies. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of the letters E, L, L, I, P, S, E, where the letter E appears twice.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of the letter E, \( n_1 \), is 2.
- The frequency of the letter L, \( n_2 \), is 2.

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). So, we need to calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Adding these values together, we get:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 + 0 + \cdots = 9
\]

Therefore, the number of zeros at the end of \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by considering the function's symmetry and possible critical points.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). That is, \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can assume without loss of generality that \( x \ge y \).

Next, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero to find the critical points. The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
The partial derivative of \( f \) with respect to \( y \) is:
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
Setting these partial derivatives to zero, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{y}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
From the first equation, we can solve for \( y \):
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = y^2 x^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 = y^2,
\]
\[
y^2 = 1 - x^2,
\]
\[
y = \pm \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
Since \( x \ge y \), we have \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

Substituting \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into the second equation, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{\sqrt{1 - (-\sqrt{1 - x^2})^2}} = x \frac{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{\sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)}} = x \frac{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{\sqrt{x^2}} = x \frac{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{|x|}.
\]
If \( x > 0 \), then \( |x| = x \), so:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{x} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2},
\]
which is a contradiction. If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \), so:
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \frac{-\sqrt{1 - x^2}}{-x} = \sqrt{1 - x^2},
\]
which is true. Therefore, \( x < 0 \) and \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \).

Now, we substitute \( x = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) into the function \( f(x, y) \):
\[
f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \sqrt{1 - y^2} + (-\sqrt{1 - x^2}) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -(1 - y^2) - (1 - x^2) = -1 + y^2 - 1 + x^2 = x^2 + y^2 - 2.
\]
Since \( x = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( y = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we have \( x^2 = 1 - y^2 \) and \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \). Therefore, \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), so:
\[
f(x, y) = 1 - 2 = -1.
\]

To check the boundary values, we evaluate \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the square \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \):
\[
f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0,
\]
\[
f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0,
\]
\[
f(-1, 1) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0,
\]
\[
f(-1, -1) = (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -2.
\]

The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is therefore \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we start by determining the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). Given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we can find the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) by subtracting \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) from \(\overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{OB} - \overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 - 1 \\ -2 - 2 \\ 1 - 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -4 \\ -4 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)).
\]
Simplifying inside the determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}.
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}.

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by letting \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta.
\]

Equating the two expressions, we get

\[
2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus,

\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the property of exponents, we have

\[
z^{85} = e^{i 85 \theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i 85 \theta}.
\]

Therefore,

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i 85 \theta} + e^{-i 85 \theta} = 2 \cos 85 \theta.
\]

To find \( \cos 85 \theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation

\[
4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0.
\]

The roots of this equation are

\[
x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}.
\]

However, we do not need the exact value of \( \theta \) to find \( \cos 85 \theta \). Instead, we use the property of the cosine function that \( \cos (2\pi k + \theta) = \cos \theta \) for any integer \( k \). We can reduce \( 85 \theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) by noting that \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, which has a periodicity property in its multiples.

The golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). This implies that the powers of \( \phi \) modulo 1 are periodic with a period of 6. Therefore, \( 85 \theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) is equivalent to \( 5 \theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \).

We can find \( \cos 5 \theta \) using the multiple-angle formula for cosine. The formula for \( \cos 5 \theta \) in terms of \( \cos \theta \) is

\[
\cos 5 \theta = 16 \cos^5 \theta - 20 \cos^3 \theta + 5 \cos \theta.
\]

Substituting \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) into this formula, we get

\[
\cos 5 \theta = 16 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^5 - 20 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^3 + 5 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right).
\]

After simplifying, we find that

\[
\cos 5 \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Therefore,

\[
\cos 85 \theta = \cos (17 \cdot 5 \theta) = \cos 5 \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}.
\]

Finally, we have

\[
z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85 \theta = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

Thus, the answer is

"To find the area of triangle \(GMN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the vertices and the sides. Specifically, \(AG:AD = 2:3\), so the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) is \(2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, and the line segment \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through \(G\), the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) for which \( 2^{24} = k^n \). This implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \), because the exponent of 2 on the left side of the equation is 24, and the exponent of 2 on the right side is \( n \log_2 k \), which must be an integer.

Therefore, we need to find the number of divisors of 24 that are greater than 1. First, we list all the divisors of 24:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]
Excluding 1, the divisors are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]
There are 7 such divisors. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

"To determine how many rupees Hillary has in nickels, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total amount of money Hillary has in rupees.
2. Determine the amount of money Hillary has in rupees in terms of dimes and quarters.
3. Calculate the amount of money Hillary has in rupees in terms of nickels.

First, we know that Hillary has a total of 11 rupees. Let's denote the number of rupees in dimes as \( d \) and the number of rupees in quarters as \( q \). The total amount of money in rupees can be expressed as:
\[ d + q = 11 \]

Next, we know that the total value of the dimes and quarters is 75 rupees. Since each dime is worth 10 rupees and each quarter is worth 25 rupees, we can write:
\[ 10d + 25q = 75 \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( d + q = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 25q = 75 \)

We can solve this system by elimination. First, we multiply the first equation by 10:
\[ 10d + 10q = 110 \]

Next, we subtract this equation from the second equation:
\[ (10d + 25q) - (10d + 10q) = 75 - 110 \]
\[ 15q = -35 \]
\[ q = -\frac{35}{15} \]
\[ q = -\frac{7}{3} \]

Since \( q \) must be a non-negative integer, we realize there was an error in interpretation.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers selected by Paul and Jesse is even, we first need to identify the six prime numbers and their properties. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, there is only one even prime number, which is 2, and the rest are odd prime numbers.

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In this case, since there is only one even prime number, the only way to get an even sum is if both Paul and Jesse select odd prime numbers.

"To find the smallest positive number whose digits are all non-zero and the sum of its digits is 450, we need to consider the properties of the number and the constraints given. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the constraints:**
   - The number must be positive.
   - All digits of the number must be non-zero.
   - The sum of the digits must be 450.

2. **Determine the maximum digit:**
   - The largest digit that is non-zero is 9.

3. **Calculate the number of digits:**
   - To find the minimum number of digits, we need to see how many 9's can sum up to 450.
   - \( \frac{450}{9} = 50 \)
   - Therefore, 50 is the minimum number of digits required.

"To determine the probability that a checkerboard square is colored black, we need to analyze the pattern of the checkerboard and the way the numbers are assigned to the rows and columns.

1. **Checkerboard Pattern**: A standard checkerboard is a grid of squares where each square is either black or white. The pattern alternates such that no two adjacent squares (horizontally or vertically) have the same color. This means that if a square is black, the squares directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of it are all white, and vice versa.

2. **Numbering System**: The numbers are assigned to the rows and columns as follows:
   - The first number in each row is divided by 4 to determine the column number, which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The second number in each row is divided by 5 to determine the row number, which can be 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. **Total Number of Squares**: The checkerboard has 4 rows and 5 columns, so there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) squares in total.

4. **Coloring of the Squares**: In a standard checkerboard, half of the squares are black and the other half are white. Since the checkerboard is 4 rows by 5 columns, the pattern will repeat every 4 rows and 5 columns. Therefore, in each 4x5 block, there will be 10 black squares and 10 white squares.

5. **Probability Calculation**: Since the checkerboard is symmetric and each square has an equal chance of being black or white, the probability that a randomly chosen square is black is simply the ratio of the number of black squares to the total number of squares. This probability is:
   \[
   \frac{10}{20} = \frac{1}{2}

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and then convert it to its decimal form.

First, let's calculate the denominator:
\[5^7 = 78125\]
\[2^8 = 256\]
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000\]

So, the fraction becomes:

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Therefore, the original expression is:

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the sum of the solutions of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted by 5. Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
49 - 5 = 44.

Thus, the sum of the solutions of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{44}\).","[44, '44']",34,"[34, '34']",False
"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
(1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \left(1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)\right).
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \sqrt{3}.
\]
Using this, we can find that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.
\]
Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
3 + 12 = 15.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles except one:**
   If the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), then the sum of all interior angles is \(1070^\circ + x\), where \(x\) is the measure of the missing angle. Since each interior angle in a convex polygon is less than \(180^\circ\), \(x\) must be less than \(180^\circ\).

3. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the right side of the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Now, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round down to the previous whole number:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

5. **Combine the results:**
   From the two inequalities, we get:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8.

The number of sides in the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the number of integers \( t \) such that \( t \) is odd, \( 0 < t < 23 \), and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We will solve this quadratic congruence by testing all odd integers \( t \) in the range \( 1 \leq t < 23 \).

First, let's test \( t = 1 \):
\[ 1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 - 1 = 1 + 2 - 1 = 2 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, let's test \( t = 3 \):
\[ 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 9 + 6 - 1 = 14 \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, let's test \( t = 5 \):
\[ 5^2 + 2 \cdot 5 - 1 = 25 + 10 - 1 = 34 \equiv 11 \pmod{23} \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, let's test \( t = 7 \):
\[ 7^2 + 2 \cdot 7 - 1 = 49 + 14 - 1 = 62 \equiv 13 \pmod{23} \not\equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, let's test \( t = 9 \):
\[ 9^2 + 2 \cdot 9 - 1 = 81 + 18 - 1 = 98 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( t = 9 \) is a solution. Since the quadratic congruence \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \) has at most two solutions, and we have found one, the other solution can be found using the fact that the sum of the roots of the quadratic equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \) is given by the coefficient of \( t \) with a sign change, which is \( -2 \). Therefore, the other root is \( -2 - 9 = -11 \equiv 12 \pmod{23} \).

So, the solutions are \( t = 9 \) and \( t = 12 \). Both of these solutions are odd and satisfy \( 0 < t < 23 \).

Thus, the number of such integers \( t \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"To determine the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we first need to find the length of one side of the cube. Since the volume of a cube is given by the formula \( V = s^3 \), where \( s \) is the length of a side, we can find \( s \) by taking the cube root of the volume:

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent function is the reciprocal of the tangent function, so \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{\tan(\theta)} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \cot^{-1}(\cot(\theta)) = \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin(\theta + \theta) = \sin(2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

We know that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). To find \(\sin(\theta)\) and \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) + \cos^2(\theta) = 1\). Since \(\tan(\theta) = x\), we have \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Therefore,
\[
\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.

Setting this equal to \(\frac{1}{3}\), we get:
\[

Cross-multiplying gives:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.

Rearranging terms, we obtain a quadratic equation:

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula

\[
d = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2 \times \mathbf{d}_1 \|}{\| \mathbf{d}_1 \|},

where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the lines. We can choose \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2\):

\[

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_1 - \mathbf{P}_2) \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[

Simplifying the components, we get:

\]

Now, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix} \| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\| \mathbf{d}_1 \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(d\) between the two lines is:

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\frac{AB}{CD} = \frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{b}{a}.
\]

Now, let's consider the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot CD \cdot AC.
\]

However, we need to express \(CD\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). Using the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the angle bisector and the trapezoid properties, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the total area of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) in \(\triangle ACD\), we can use the ratio of the areas of the triangles formed by the angle bisector.

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot [ABCD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) in \(\triangle ACD\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot h_1 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 42}{a + b} = \frac{42}{2} = 21.
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Eliminate the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\) by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:**

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of \(21\) and \(30\) is \(3\), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \(3\):
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. This will happen if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since the circle has no starting point, we fix one point and arrange the other 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (6) distinct arrangements of the points around the circle.

3. **Number of Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders). Therefore, there are 2 favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's proceed step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is 2. Therefore, the area of the larger circle is:
   \[
   \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The radius of the smaller circle is 1. Therefore, the area of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   \pi \times 1^2 = \pi

3. **Calculate the total area of the shaded region:**
   The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the total area of the shaded region is:

4. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. The area of the larger segment (the part of the larger circle outside the smaller circle) is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle:
   \[
   4\pi - \pi = 3\pi

   The area of the smaller segment (the part of the smaller circle inside the larger circle) is the area of the smaller circle:

   The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the area of the larger segment and the area of the smaller segment:

"To determine how much water is needed to fill a sphere with a radius of 6 cm using a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylinder and the sphere and then find the ratio of the sphere's volume to the cylinder's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Substituting the given values:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. Substituting the given value:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylinders of water are required to fill the sphere. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of one cylinder:
\[ \text{Number of cylinders} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = 4 \]

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Therefore, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9

"To determine the number of ways to form a board of 5 members that includes at least one member from each of the two divisions (ThượngLibrary and DânChen), we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a board of 5 members without any restrictions and then subtracting the number of ways to form a board that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a board with all members from only one division).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a board of 5 members from the 14 members (8 from ThượngLibrary and 6 from DânChen):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a board of 5 members that are all from ThượngLibrary:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a board of 5 members that are all from DânChen:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6

Now, add the number of ways to form a board of 5 members that are all from ThượngLibrary and the number of ways to form a board of 5 members that are all from DânChen:

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\) that satisfies this equation. We can do this by testing some integer values for \(x\):

If \(x = 4\):
\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]
This is true, so \(x = 4\) is a solution.

If \(x = 5\):

This is greater than 120, so \(x = 5\) is not a solution.

If \(x = 3\):

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096

So the equation becomes:

\[

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Similarly, \( AC^2 = AB^2 = 121 + BM^2 \).

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \), so:
\[
\angle DBC + \angle DCB + \angle BDC = 180^\circ \implies 2 \angle DBC + 3\theta = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}.
\]

Now, consider \( \triangle ABD \). Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = 1 \). Using the right triangle \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 \implies BD^2 = BM^2 + 1^2 \implies BD^2 = BM^2 + 1.
\]

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}.
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}}.
\]
Thus, \( BC = 2BD \sin \frac{3\theta}{2} \).

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD}.
\]
Since \( \angle ADB = 180^\circ - \angle ABD \), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB} = \frac{10}{\sin \angle ABD}.
\]
Thus, \( BD = \frac{10 \sin \theta}{\sin \angle ADB} \).

Equating the two expressions for \( BD \):
\[
\frac{10 \sin \theta}{\sin \angle ADB} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{3\theta}{2}}.

Solving for \( \sin \angle ADB \):
\[
\sin \angle ADB = \frac{10 \sin \theta \sin \frac{3\theta}{2}}{BD}.

\sin \angle ADB = \frac{10 \sin 30^\circ \sin 45^\circ}{BD} = \frac{10 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{BD} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{2BD}.
\]

Thus, \( BD = 10 \) and \( BC = 2 \cdot 10 \sin 45^\circ = 2 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = 10\sqrt{3} \).

"To find the middle number of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sum of the 27 consecutive integers:**
   The sum of the 27 consecutive integers is given as \(3^7\).

2. **Calculate \(3^7\):**
   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
   \]
   So, the sum of the 27 consecutive integers is 2187.

3. **Determine the middle number:**
   The middle number of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th number in the sequence. This is because the position of the middle number in a set of \(n\) consecutive integers is \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th number. For \(n = 27\):
   \[
   \left(\frac{27+1}{2}\right) = 14
   \]
   Therefore, the middle number is the 14th number in the sequence.

4. **Express the sum of the 27 consecutive integers in terms of the middle number:**
   Let the 14th number be \(x\). The 27 consecutive integers can be written as:
   \[
   x-13, x-12, x-11, \ldots, x, x+1, x+2, \ldots, x+13

   The sum of these 27 integers is:

   (x-13) + (x-12) + (x-11) + \cdots + x + (x+1) + (x+2) + \cdots + (x+13)

   This can be simplified as:
   \[
   27x

   We know that the sum of these 27 integers is 2187, so:
   \[
   27x = 2187
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

Therefore, the middle number of the 27 consecutive integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) step by step.

First, let's rewrite the expression in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2. \]
Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ -4 < y^2 + 4y < 21. \]

We will solve this compound inequality by breaking it into two separate inequalities:
1. \( y^2 + 4y > -4 \)
2. \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \)

**Step 1: Solve \( y^2 + 4y > -4 \)**

Rearrange the inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y + 4 > 0. \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (y + 2)^2 > 0. \]
The expression \((y + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number and is always non-negative, with the only solution being \( y = -2 \). Therefore, the inequality \((y + 2)^2 > 0\) is true for all \( y \neq -2 \). Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we have \( y > -2 \) for all real \( x \). So, the solution to the first inequality is:
\[ y > -2. \]
Since \( y = x^2 \), this means:
\[ x^2 > -2, \]
which is true for all real \( x \).

**Step 2: Solve \( y^2 + 4y < 21 \)**

Rearrange the inequality:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0. \]
This can be factored as:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) < 0. \]
The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \( y = -7 \) and \( y = 3 \). The expression \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots. Therefore, the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is true for:
\[ -7 < y < 3. \]
Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we have:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3. \]
So, the solution to the second inequality is:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3. \]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Combining the solutions to both inequalities, we find that the values of \( x \) that satisfy the original inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}. \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start with the given equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[
s^3 = 64,

\[
s = 4.

First, let's calculate the number of boys and girls who drive cars in each grade:

**Grade 9:**
- Number of boys who drive cars: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
- Number of girls who drive cars: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
- Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.0426\)

**Grade 10:**
- Number of boys who drive cars: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
- Number of girls who drive cars: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
- Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.0404\)

**Grade 11:**
- Number of boys who drive cars: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
- Number of girls who drive cars: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
- Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.5122\)

**Grade 12:**
- Number of boys who drive cars: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
- Number of girls who drive cars: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
- Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.3462\)

- Grade 9: 1.0426
- Grade 10: 1.0404
- Grade 11: 1.5122
- Grade 12: 1.3462

The ratio closest to 1.35 is 1.3462, which corresponds to Grade 12.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   - Choose \(x = -10\).
   - The numerator \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-10)(-10 - 36) = (-10)(-46) = 460\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   - Choose \(x = -1\).
   - The numerator \(|(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   - Choose \(x = 1\).
   - The numerator \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   - Choose \(x = 10\).
   - The numerator \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((10)(10 - 36) = (10)(-26) = -260\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   - Choose \(x = 37\).
   - The numerator \(|37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the area of the largest possible circular necklace that can be bao quanh by a running track, we need to consider the given information and the geometry of the problem. The running track consists of two sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The running track is composed of two sides of the rectangle and two semicircles, which together form a full circle with diameter \( W \). Therefore, the length of the track is given by:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400. \]

We want to maximize the area of the rectangle, which is given by:
\[ A = L \times W. \]

From the equation \( 2L + \pi W = 400 \), we can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}. \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}. \]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0. \]

Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[ W = \frac{200}{\pi}. \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = 100. \]

The area of the rectangle is then:
\[ A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}. \]

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by understanding the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the sine function. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse.

Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can denote the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) as 2 and the hypotenuse as 5. Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(x\):

\[

\]
\[
x^2 + 4 = 25
\]
\[
x^2 = 21
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{21}

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary (they add up to \(90^\circ\)), we have \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\). The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complementary angle. Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

We can find \(\cos{R}\) using the adjacent side and the hypotenuse:

\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

"To find the shortest distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(D\) between the origin and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x \]
\[ f'(x) = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]
\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(D\) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

In the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer larger than 1, the sum \(a + b\) is:

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

\[ F = m_J a_J \]
\[ F = m_K a_K \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_J a_J = m_K a_K \]

We need to find the ratio of the accelerations \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \). To do this, we solve for \( a_J \) and \( a_K \) in terms of \( F \):

\[ a_J = \frac{F}{m_J} \]
\[ a_K = \frac{F}{m_K} \]

Now, we take the ratio of \( a_J \) to \( a_K \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{\frac{F}{m_J}}{\frac{F}{m_K}} = \frac{F}{m_J} \cdot \frac{m_K}{F} = \frac{m_K}{m_J} \]

We are given that the mass of the ball Jen nemes is \( m_J = 200 \) g and the mass of the ball Jack nemes is \( m_K = 150 \) g. Substituting these values into the ratio, we get:

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the accelerations of the ball Jen nemes to the ball Jack nemes is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine how many digits are identical in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits in the same positions:

- The first digit (from the left) is 1 in both representations.
- The second digit is 5 in the base 7 representation and 1 in the base 8 representation.
- The third digit is 5 in the base 7 representation and 6 in the base 8 representation.
- The fourth digit is 6 in the base 7 representation and 5 in the base 8 representation.

The only digit that is identical in both representations is the first digit, which is 1.

"To determine the number of interactions that occurred at the dinner party, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 10 participants in total, including the host.
2. Each participant, except the host, has decided to take a bow with each of the other participants.
3. The host is not taking a bow with any of the other participants.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the number of participants other than the host. Since there are 10 participants in total and one of them is the host, there are \(10 - 1 = 9\) participants other than the host.
2. Each of these 9 participants takes a bow with each of the other 9 participants. Therefore, each of these 9 participants has 9 interactions (one bow with each of the other 9 participants).
3. Since there are 9 participants, and each participant has 9 interactions, the total number of interactions is \(9 \times 9 = 81\).

Thus, the number of interactions that occurred at the dinner party is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",60,"[60, '60']",False

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[

Next, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). This gives us:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3,\) and \(\alpha_4\). According to Vieta's formulas, for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]
For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, the sums and products of the roots are:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]
We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]
We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3) = 0 - 0 = 0.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]
Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get:

\]
Factoring out \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4\), we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 2 \cdot 0 = 0.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0.
\]
Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\), the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) must be \(\{a, 0, -a\}\) for some \(a \neq 0\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{a, 0, -a\}\), which has 2 distinct elements.

"To determine the price of a single tree branch before tax, we need to know the total price of the tree branch including tax and the tax rate. However, the problem does not provide the tax rate directly. Instead, it provides two different total prices for the same item, which suggests that the tax rate is the same for both items.

Let's denote the price of the tree branch before tax as \( P \) and the tax rate as \( r \). The total price of the tree branch including tax can be expressed as:
\[ \text{Total Price} = P + Pr = P(1 + r) \]

We are given two total prices:
1. \( P(1 + r) = 1.24 \)
2. \( P(1 + r) = 1.82 \)

Since the tax rate \( r \) is the same for both items, the difference in the total prices must be due to the difference in the price before tax. However, the problem does not provide enough information to determine the tax rate or the price before tax directly from the given data. Therefore, we need to assume that the problem is asking for the price before tax based on the given total prices, which implies that the tax rate is the same and the difference in total prices is due to the difference in the price before tax.

Given that the problem does not provide the tax rate, we can only conclude that the price before tax is the same for both items, which is not possible with the given data. Therefore, the problem is not solvable with the given data.

However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the price before tax based on the given total prices, we can use the fact that the tax rate is the same and the difference in total prices is due to the difference in the price before tax. The difference in total prices is:
\[ 1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58 \]

This difference must be due to the difference in the price before tax. Since the tax rate is the same, the difference in the price before tax is the same as the difference in the total prices. Therefore, the price before tax is:
\[ P = \frac{1.24}{1 + r} \]

Since the problem does not provide the tax rate, we cannot determine the exact price before tax. However, if we assume that the problem is asking for the price before tax based on the given total prices, the price before tax is:
\[ \boxed{1.24} \]

This is the price before tax for the first item, which is the same as the price before tax for the second item. Therefore, the price before tax is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\). The vertices are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The point \(O\) is equidistant from all four vertices. The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the region inside the circle with center \(O\) and radius equal to the distance from \(O\) to any vertex.

Since \(AB/AD = k\), let \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with legs \(a/2\) and \(b/2\). Therefore, the distance from \(O\) to any vertex is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(\frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{b}{2}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}
\]

The area of the circle with center \(O\) and radius \(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}\) is:
\[
\pi \left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \pi \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
a \cdot b

The probability that a randomly selected point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{\pi \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}}{a \cdot b} = \frac{\pi (a^2 + b^2)}{4ab}

To express this probability in terms of \(k\), we use the relationship \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression, we get:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.7082 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.7082 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Given that the length is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet, we substitute these values into the formula:

Therefore, the cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest possible distance that can be traveled if you start from any point \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), or \( D \) and visit the other three points exactly once, we need to consider the distances between each pair of points and find the minimum total distance for each starting point.

First, let's list the distances between the points:
- \( AB = 5 \)
- \( AC = 6 \)
- \( AD = 5 \)
- \( BC = 4 \)
- \( BD = 3 \)
- \( CD = 6 \)

We will calculate the total distance for each possible starting point and each possible permutation of the other three points.

### Starting from Point \( A \)
1. \( A \to B \to C \to D \)
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 5 + 4 + 6 = 15
   \]
2. \( A \to B \to D \to C \)
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 5 + 3 + 6 = 14
   \]
3. \( A \to C \to B \to D \)
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
4. \( A \to C \to D \to B \)
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
   \]
5. \( A \to D \to B \to C \)
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 4 = 12
   \]
6. \( A \to D \to C \to B \)
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \( A \) is 12.

### Starting from Point \( B \)
1. \( B \to A \to C \to D \)
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17
   \]
2. \( B \to A \to D \to C \)
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 5 + 5 + 6 = 16
   \]
3. \( B \to C \to A \to D \)
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15
   \]
4. \( B \to C \to D \to A \)
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15
   \]
5. \( B \to D \to A \to C \)
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. \( B \to D \to C \to A \)
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \( B \) is 14.

### Starting from Point \( C \)
1. \( C \to A \to B \to D \)
   \[
   CA + AB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
2. \( C \to A \to D \to B \)
   \[
   CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
3. \( C \to B \to A \to D \)
   \[
   CB + BA + AD = 4 + 5 + 5 = 14
   \]
4. \( C \to B \to D \to A \)
   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12
   \]
5. \( C \to D \to A \to B \)
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16
   \]
6. \( C \to D \to B \to A \)
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \( C \) is 12.

### Starting from Point \( D \)
1. \( D \to A \to B \to C \)
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 5 + 4 = 14
   \]
2. \( D \to A \to C \to B \)
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15
   \]
3. \( D \to B \to A \to C \)
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
4. \( D \to B \to C \to A \)
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   \]
5. \( D \to C \to A \to B \)
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 6 + 6 + 5 = 17
   \]
6. \( D \to C \to B \to A \)
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15
   \]

The minimum distance starting from \( D \) is 13.

From the above calculations, the minimum distance that can be traveled is 12. Therefore, the answer is:
