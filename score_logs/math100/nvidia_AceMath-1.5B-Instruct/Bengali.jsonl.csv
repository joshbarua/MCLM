"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by noting that \(D\) is at \((\sqrt{51}, 7)\) and \(E\) is at \((0, 7)\). The point \(F\) is at the origin \((0, 0)\). The length of \(EF\) is given as 7 units.

Since \(D\) and \(E\) both have the same \(y\)-coordinate, the distance \(DE\) is simply the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates. Therefore, we have:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51} - 0 = \sqrt{51}

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise, we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

   We expand this product:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. Since \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), we have:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine how many different ways 8 individuals can sit around a table such that 3 specific individuals (Pierre, Rose, and Thomas) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the 3 specific individuals as a single ""block"" or ""unit"".** This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table. The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 6 units in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

2. **Arrange the 3 specific individuals within their block.** There are \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange 3 individuals in a line, which is \(3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

3. **Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange the 3 individuals within their block.** This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term \(T_k\) becomes:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For \(T_k\) to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Now, multiply these values together:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[

\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]
So,
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees the clock must be rotated to match its original position, we need to consider the properties of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The clock's hands move in a circular motion, and the clock's center is the same as the center of the pentagon.

The clock's hands move in a way that each hour corresponds to a specific angle. Since a full circle is 360 degrees, and there are 12 hours on a clock, each hour represents an angle of:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{12} = 30^\circ
\]

However, the problem states that the hands move in a way that is opposite to the hour hand. This means that the clock's hands move in a way that each hour corresponds to an angle of:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

To find the minimum number of degrees the clock must be rotated to match its original position, we need to consider the smallest positive angle that will bring the clock back to its starting position. Since the clock's hands move in a way that each hour corresponds to an angle of 72 degrees, the clock will return to its original position after 5 hours. Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the clock must be rotated is:
\[
5 \times 72^\circ = 360^\circ
\]

However, since the clock's hands move in a way that is opposite to the hour hand, the clock will return to its original position after 5 hours, which is:
\[
5 \times 72^\circ = 360^\circ

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the clock must be rotated to match its original position is:

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the vertices \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, let's denote the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting the vertices \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) as:
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
1. \(\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6\)
2. \(\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}\)

Let's solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex must satisfy the condition \(x > 7\).

Let's solve the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Now, we need to find the correct \(x\) that satisfies the condition \(x > 7\). Since the midpoint condition must hold, we re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex must satisfy the condition \(x > 7\).

The correct interpretation is that the fourth vertex must be such that the sum of the coordinates of the fourth vertex is greater than 13. Therefore, the correct value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 13

Thus, the correct answer is:

The tangent function is defined as the ratio of the sine function to the cosine function, so we have:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]
Given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute this into the tangent function:

"To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes (which are the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero) and the horizontal asymptote (which is the value of \(y\) that the function approaches as \(x\) goes to infinity).

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0,\]
\[x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)}\). If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). So, \(c = 0\).

Now, we need to find the sum \(a + b + c\):
\[a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5.\]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b + c\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break it down into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):
\[
99^2 = 99 \times 99

We can use the distributive property to simplify this:
\[
99 \times 99 = (100 - 1) \times (100 - 1) = 100^2 - 2 \times 100 \times 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801
\]
So, \(99^2 = 9801\).

Next, we add \(99\) to \(9801\):
\[
9801 + 99

We can add these two numbers directly:
\[
9801 + 99 = 9900
\]

Finally, we add \(1\) to \(9900\):
\[
9900 + 1 = 9901

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{9901}\).","[9901, '9901']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",True

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16)
\]
The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest positive integer \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

\[

Thus, we have:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9

To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the expression:
\[

\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

2. The weight of two triangles and one circle is equal to the weight of one square:

We need to find how many triangles' weights are equal to the weight of one square. In other words, we need to find \( x \) such that:

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information and using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

From the problem, we know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. Let's denote the radius of the tank by \( R \) meters and the height of the water by \( h \) meters. The volume of water in the tank at any time is:

\[ V = \pi R^2 h \]

Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We also know that the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Using the chain rule, we can differentiate the volume equation with respect to time:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi R^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi R^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4R^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( R^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ R^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find \( R \):

\[ R = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is:

\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the function piecewise and ensure that there are no horizontal lines that intersect the graph more than once.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ 
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. 
\end{cases} \]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect each horizontal line at most once
To ensure that the function intersects each horizontal line at most once, the parabola \(ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) must not intersect the line \(ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) more than once, and vice versa.

#### Case 1: \(a > 0\)
- The parabola \(ax^2\) opens upwards.
- The line \(ax + 2a\) has a positive slope.
- The line \(ax + 2a\) will intersect the parabola \(ax^2\) at most once if the vertex of the parabola is to the left of the line or if the line is tangent to the parabola.

The vertex of the parabola \(ax^2\) is at \(x = 0\). For the line \(ax + 2a\) to intersect the parabola at most once, the x-coordinate of the vertex must be less than or equal to \(a\):
\[ 0 \leq a. \]
This condition is always true for \(a > 0\).

#### Case 2: \(a < 0\)
- The parabola \(ax^2\) opens downwards.
- The line \(ax + 2a\) has a negative slope.
- The line \(ax + 2a\) will intersect the parabola \(ax^2\) at most once if the vertex of the parabola is to the right of the line or if the line is tangent to the parabola.

The vertex of the parabola \(ax^2\) is at \(x = 0\). For the line \(ax + 2a\) to intersect the parabola at most once, the x-coordinate of the vertex must be greater than or equal to \(a\):
\[ 0 \geq a. \]
This condition is always true for \(a < 0\).

### Step 4: Determine the maximum value of \(a\)
From the above analysis, we see that the function \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once for any \(a \neq 0\). However, we need to ensure that the function does not intersect the line \(ax + 2a\) at \(x = a\) more than once. This means that the value of \(f(a)\) from the left side must be less than or equal to the value of \(f(a)\) from the right side:
\[ a(a) + 2a \leq a(a^2). \]
Simplifying this inequality:
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3. \]
Rearranging terms:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0. \]
The roots of the equation are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). The inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0\) holds for \(a \leq -1\) or \(a \geq 2\).

Since we are looking for the maximum value of \(a\), we choose \(a = 2\).

Thus, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a diameter of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\):
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\):
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combining the constants on the right side, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearranging gives:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the diameter of the circle is 1. Since the diameter is twice the radius, we have:
\[ 2r = 1 \]
\[ r = \frac{1}{2} \]

Substituting \( r = \frac{1}{2} \) into the radius expression, we get:
\[ \sqrt{34 - c} = \frac{1}{2} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 34 - c = \frac{1}{4} \]
To solve for \( c \), we subtract \(\frac{1}{4}\) from 34:
\[ 34 = c + \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ c = 34 - \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ c = \frac{136}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \]
\[ c = \frac{135}{4} \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{\frac{135}{4}}\).","[135/4, '\\frac{135}{4}']",33,"[33, '33']",False
"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start with the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\). We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\).

First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x),
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,
\]
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,
\]
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we obtain a polynomial equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + 2\lambda^3 x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
For there to be a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), the polynomial must have a root in \((0,1)\). We will test the values of \(\lambda\) at the endpoints of the interval \([0,4]\) to see if we can find a value that satisfies the condition.

1. For \(\lambda = 0\):
\[
f(x) = 0 \implies f(f(x)) = 0 \implies x = 0.
\]
There is no \(x \in (0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

2. For \(\lambda = 4\):
\[
f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2).
\]
We need:
\[
16x(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
16(1 - x)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
16(1 - 4x + 4x^2 - x + 4x^2 - 4x^3) = 1,
\]
\[
16(1 - 5x + 8x^2 - 4x^3) = 1,
\]
\[
16 - 80x + 128x^2 - 64x^3 = 1,
\]
\[
-64x^3 + 128x^2 - 80x + 15 = 0.
\]
We need to check if this polynomial has a root in \((0,1)\). By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{8}, \pm \frac{1}{16}, \pm \frac{1}{32}, \pm \frac{1}{64}, \pm \frac{1}{128}, \pm \frac{15}{64}, \pm \frac{15}{32}, \pm \frac{15}{16}, \pm \frac{15}{8}, \pm \frac{15}{4}, \pm \frac{15}{2}, \pm 15\). Testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
-64\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 128\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 80\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 15 = -64 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 128 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 80 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 15 = -8 + 32 - 40 + 15 = -1.
\]
Since \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a root, we need to check other values or use numerical methods. However, we can use the fact that the function \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\) has a maximum value of 1 at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and is symmetric about \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a root in \((0,1)\) for \(\lambda = 4\).

First, we group the terms in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\text{Numerator: } \cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ,

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify these expressions. Recall that:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B),
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

Applying these formulas, we get:
\[
\text{Numerator: } \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ,
\]
\[
\text{Denominator: } \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the sum-to-product identities for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A + \cos B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left( \frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin (-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = -\cos 55^\circ.

Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by using the formula for the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If either \( x \) or \( y \) is \( \pm 1 \), then the other variable must be 0 to maximize the function. Let's check these cases:

1. If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 0 \), then \( f(1, 0) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \).
2. If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 0 \), then \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \).
3. If \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \), then \( f(0, 1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \).
4. If \( x = 0 \) and \( y = -1 \), then \( f(0, -1) = 0 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1 \).

From these boundary values, we see that the maximum value is 1. Now, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the region \( -1 < x, y < 1 \).

To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:

\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]
\[
\frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0
\]

From the first equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \implies (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

From the second equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy^2}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} \implies (1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \implies 1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

So, the critical points satisfy \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). Substituting \( y^2 = 1 - x^2 \) into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:

\[
f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - (1 - x^2)} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{x^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x |x| + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

If \( x \ge 0 \), then \( |x| = x \), so:

\[
f(x, y) = x^2 + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

If \( x < 0 \), then \( |x| = -x \), so:

\[
f(x, y) = -x^2 + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

In both cases, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1, which occurs at the points \( (1, 0) \) and \( (-1, 0) \).

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) satisfies \( 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). This implies that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation:

\[ 4x^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})x + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ x = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{8} \pm \frac{\sqrt{5 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{8}. \]

However, we can use the property of the golden ratio, which states that \( \cos \theta = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4} \) is a root of the equation \( 4x^2 - 2x - 1 = 0 \). The corresponding angle \( \theta \) is \( \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \frac{7\pi}{10} \).

We need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Since \( \theta = \frac{3\pi}{10} \) or \( \theta = \frac{7\pi}{10} \), we have:

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{3\pi}{10} = \frac{255\pi}{10} = 25.5\pi = 25\pi + \frac{\pi}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{7\pi}{10} = \frac{595\pi}{10} = 59.5\pi = 59\pi + \frac{\pi}{2}. \]

In both cases, \( \cos 85\theta = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 0 \).

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

\[ \boxed{0}. \]","[0, '0']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"To find the area of triangle \(MNC\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(M\) and \(N\) are points on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively, and \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Because \(G\) is the centroid, \(AG:AD = 2:3\), so \(AG:AD = AM:AB = AN:AC = 2:3\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
\]

The area of quadrilateral \(MBCN\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle MBCN = 144 - 64 = 80

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the line segment \(MN\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1. Therefore, the area of triangle \(MNC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of quadrilateral \(MBCN\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle MNC = \frac{1}{3} \times 80 = \frac{80}{3}

Thus, the area of triangle \(MNC\) is:

2. Calculate the total number of books in the selected groups.
3. Determine the number of mathematics books in the selected groups.
4. Calculate the fraction of the total number of selected books that are about mathematics.

Let's start with the first step:

1. The number of books in each selected group is:
   - Top group: 8 books
   - Middle group: 10 books
   - Bottom group: 6 books

2. The total number of books in the selected groups is:
   \[

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula for the volume of a cone:

"To find the 7th term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

where:
- \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term,
- \(a_1\) is the first term,
- \(d\) is the common difference,
- \(n\) is the term number.

We are given the 4th term \(a_4 = 200\) and the 8th term \(a_8 = 500\). Using the general formula, we can write:

\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the equation for the 4th term from the equation for the 8th term:

\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference, we can substitute \(d\) back into the equation for the 4th term to find the first term \(a_1\):

\[ a_1 + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a_1 + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a_1 = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a_1 = -25 \]

"To determine how many positive two-digit numbers have a product of digits equal to 100 or 150, we need to find all pairs of digits \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 100\) or \(a \times b = 150\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are digits from 1 to 9 (since we are looking for two-digit numbers, the first digit cannot be 0).

### Step 1: Find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 100\)
We need to find all pairs of digits \((a, b)\) such that their product is 100. Let's list the factor pairs of 100:
\[100 = 1 \times 100\]
\[100 = 2 \times 50\]
\[100 = 4 \times 25\]
\[100 = 5 \times 20\]
\[100 = 10 \times 10\]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) must be digits from 1 to 9, the only valid pair is:
\[10 \times 10\]

However, 10 is not a valid digit, so there are no valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 100\).

### Step 2: Find pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 150\)
We need to find all pairs of digits \((a, b)\) such that their product is 150. Let's list the factor pairs of 150:
\[150 = 1 \times 150\]
\[150 = 2 \times 75\]
\[150 = 3 \times 50\]
\[150 = 5 \times 30\]
\[150 = 6 \times 25\]
\[150 = 10 \times 15\]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) must be digits from 1 to 9, the only valid pair is:
\[10 \times 15\]

However, 10 and 15 are not valid digits, so there are no valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 150\).

### Conclusion
Since there are no valid pairs \((a, b)\) such that \(a \times b = 100\) or \(a \times b = 150\), there are no positive two-digit numbers whose digits multiply to 100 or 150.

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n > 1 \) such that there exists an integer \( k \) for which \( 2^{24} = k^n \).

This equation implies that \( 24 \) must be divisible by \( n \) because the exponent of 2 on the left side is 24, and the exponent of 2 on the right side is \( n \log_2 k \), which must be an integer. Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are the numbers that divide 24 without leaving a remainder. We can find them by checking each number from 1 to 24:

\[

"To determine how many nickels are in the jar, we need to know the value of each type of coin and the total value of all the coins combined. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Identify the value of each coin:
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - A penny is worth 1 cent.

2. Determine the total value of the dimes and pennies:
   - The jar contains 15 dimes and 30 pennies.
   - The value of the dimes is \(15 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 150 \text{ cents}\).
   - The value of the pennies is \(30 \text{ pennies} \times 1 \text{ cent/penny} = 30 \text{ cents}\).
   - The combined value of the dimes and pennies is \(150 \text{ cents} + 30 \text{ cents} = 180 \text{ cents}\).

3. Determine the value of the nickels:
   - The total value of all the coins in the jar is 75 cents.
   - The value of the nickels is \(75 \text{ cents} - 180 \text{ cents} = -105 \text{ cents}\).

Since the value of the nickels is negative, it means there is an error in the problem statement or the interpretation. The total value of the dimes and pennies is already 180 cents, which is greater than the total value of 75 cents. Therefore, it is impossible to have any nickels in the jar if the total value of the dimes and pennies is 180 cents.

"To solve the problem, we need to identify the first six prime numbers and then determine the probability that the sum of any two of these primes, when added to a third prime, equals the sum of any other two primes, when added to a different third prime.

First, let's list the first six prime numbers:
\[2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\]

We need to find the probability that the sum of any two of these primes, when added to a third prime, is equal to the sum of any other two primes, when added to a different third prime. Let's denote the primes as \(a, b, c, d, e, f\) where \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), \(c = 5\), \(d = 7\), \(e = 11\), and \(f = 13\).

We need to check if there exist distinct pairs \((a, b, c)\) and \((d, e, f)\) such that:
\[a + b + c = d + e + f\]

First, let's calculate the sum of all six primes:
\[2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 = 41\]

Since we are adding three primes, the sum of any three primes will be:
\[41 - (a + b + c)\]

We need to find pairs \((a, b, c)\) and \((d, e, f)\) such that:
\[a + b + c = d + e + f\]

This implies:

\[41 = 2 \times (a + b + c)\]
\[a + b + c = \frac{41}{2}\]

Since \(a + b + c\) must be an integer, and \(\frac{41}{2}\) is not an integer, it is impossible to find such pairs of primes.

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include all these prime factors. Therefore, the number must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. This means the number must be even, the sum of its digits must be a multiple of 9, and the last two digits must form a number that is a multiple of 25.

We need to find the smallest such number whose digits sum to zero and include the digit 1. Let's start by considering the smallest possible numbers that meet these criteria.

"To determine the probability that the pointer lands on the square where the two numbers intersect, we need to analyze the process step by step.

1. **First Check (Modulo 4):**
   - The pointer lands on one of the four squares labeled 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Each square has an equal probability of being chosen, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

2. **Second Check (Modulo 5):**
   - The pointer lands on one of the five squares labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
   - Each square has an equal probability of being chosen, which is \(\frac{1}{5}\).

3. **Intersection Square:**
   - The intersection square is the square where the result of the first check (mod 4) and the result of the second check (mod 5) match.
   - There are 4 possible results for the first check and 5 possible results for the second check, so there are \(4 \times 5 = 20\) possible outcomes in total.
   - Only one of these outcomes corresponds to the intersection square (the square where the results match).

4. **Probability Calculation:**
   - The probability that the pointer lands on the intersection square is the probability that the result of the first check (mod 4) and the result of the second check (mod 5) match.
   - Since each of the 20 outcomes is equally likely, the probability of landing on the intersection square is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]

We can rewrite this as:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the known values of the sine function:
\[
\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \frac{3}{4} (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

To find the value of \((\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2\), we can use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}.
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. This means that if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \).

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we can use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Since the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \) where \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This gives us:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) again to rewrite the expression in terms of sine:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}, \quad \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]
So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\). We need to find a common form for the expression. We can use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The identity states:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ - x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (60^\circ + x)} = \frac{27}{\sin^2 3x}.
\]
For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 50^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 70^\circ} = \frac{27}{\sin^2 30^\circ} = \frac{27}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = 108.
\]
However, we need the sum \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). Using the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\), \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\), we can use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sines of angles in arithmetic progression again:
\[

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, if one of the interior angles is removed, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is \( 1070^\circ + \text{(one interior angle)} \). Since the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( 180(n-2) \), we can write:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + \text{(one interior angle)}
\]

The interior angle that is removed must be less than \( 180^\circ \). Let's denote the removed interior angle by \( x \). Then we have:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since \( x \) is an interior angle of a polygon, it must be less than \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, the sum of the remaining interior angles, \( 1070^\circ \), must be less than \( 180(n-2) \). We can find the range for \( n \) by considering the maximum possible value for \( x \), which is just less than \( 180^\circ \). For simplicity, we can use \( x = 180^\circ - \epsilon \) where \( \epsilon \) is a very small positive number, but for practical purposes, we can approximate \( x \) as \( 180^\circ \) to find the upper bound for \( n \):

\[
180(n-2) \approx 1070 + 180
\]
\[
180(n-2) \approx 1250
\]
\[
n-2 \approx \frac{1250}{180}
\]
\[
n-2 \approx 6.9444
\]
\[
n \approx 8.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number, which is 9. Therefore, the polygon must have 9 sides. To confirm, we calculate the sum of the interior angles of a 9-sided polygon:

\[
180(9-2) = 180 \times 7 = 1260^\circ
\]

If one interior angle is removed, the sum of the remaining interior angles is:

\[
1260^\circ - x
\]

Since \( x \) is less than \( 180^\circ \), the sum of the remaining interior angles is indeed greater than \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. We need to check which of these values satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) being the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

For \( t = 4 \):

\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):

\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

Therefore, the integers \( t \) that satisfy the given conditions are 4 and 17. Since the problem asks for one such \( t \), we can choose either. For the sake of a single answer, we can choose the smaller one:

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\), so \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|}.
\]

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the cross product \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} (7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j} (-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k} (-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14) = 31 \mathbf{i} - 6 \mathbf{j} + 58 \mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of \((\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Now, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie within the given square, we first need to identify the coordinates of the square's vertices and then count all the integer points that lie within the square, including the boundary.

The vertices of the square are given as \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\). This square is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a side length of \(10\) units (since the distance from \(-5\) to \(5\) is \(10\)).

The square extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). We need to count all integer points \((x, y)\) such that \(-5 \leq x \leq 5\) and \(-4 \leq y \leq 4\).

First, we count the number of integer values \(x\) can take. The integers from \(-5\) to \(5\) are:
\[
-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\[

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},
\]
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.
\]

Combining these results, we have

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} - 2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

We know from the problem statement that

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Using these, we can substitute the values into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

"To find the average number of stamps in Juan's collection from the 70s, we need to calculate the total number of stamps from the 1970s and then divide by the number of decades (which is 10).

First, let's list the number of stamps per decade:
- 1960s: 6 stamps per decade
- 1970s: 12 stamps per decade
- 1980s: 6 stamps per decade
- 1990s: 13 stamps per decade

Since there are 10 decades in a century, we can calculate the total number of stamps for each decade and then sum them up.

For the 1960s:
\[ 6 \text{ stamps/decade} \times 1 \text{ decade} = 6 \text{ stamps} \]

For the 1970s:
\[ 12 \text{ stamps/decade} \times 1 \text{ decade} = 12 \text{ stamps} \]

To find the average number of stamps per decade, we divide the total number of stamps by the number of decades:
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{37 \text{ stamps}}{4 \text{ decades}} = 9.25 \text{ stamps/decade} \]

Since we are asked for the average number of stamps in the 70s, we multiply the average by 10:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a parallelogram with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the area of \(\triangle ACD\) as \([ACD]\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), it divides \(\triangle ACD\) into two triangles, \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), which are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. However, because \(\overline{AC}\) is also the altitude from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as one of its legs.

The area of parallelogram \(ABCD\) is given by the product of the base and the height. Here, we can consider \(\overline{CD}\) as the base and the perpendicular distance from \(A\) to \(\overline{CD}\) as the height, which is the length of \(\overline{AC}\). Therefore, the area of parallelogram \(ABCD\) is:
\[
[ABCD] = \text{base} \times \text{height} = CD \times AC
\]
We are given that \([ABCD] = 42\), so:
\[
CD \times AC = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\overline{CD}\) is the base, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC
\]
Substituting the value of \(CD \times AC\) from the area of the parallelogram, we get:
\[
[ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To determine the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect inside a circle, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the chords.

First, let's fix one of the endpoints of the chord, say \(A\), and place it at a specific point on the circle. The position of \(A\) does not affect the probability because the circle is symmetric. Now, we need to place the other three points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on the circle such that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

For the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle starting from \(A\), the points must be in one of the following orders: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). Any other arrangement will result in the chords not intersecting.

The total number of ways to arrange the points \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) around the circle is \(3!\) (3 factorial), which is \(6\). Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords intersecting. Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements.

Thus, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in the given configuration of two circles with centers \(D\) and radii 1 and 2, respectively, and a chord \(AC\) that intersects the circles at points \(A\) and \(C\).

First, let's denote the radii of the circles as follows:
- The radius of the smaller circle is \(r_1 = 1\).
- The radius of the larger circle is \(r_2 = 2\).

The centers of the circles are \(D\) and \(E\), respectively. The distance between the centers \(D\) and \(E\) is the sum of the radii, which is \(DE = r_1 + r_2 = 1 + 2 = 3\).

The chord \(AC\) is common to both circles. Let \(A\) and \(C\) be the points where the chord intersects the smaller and larger circles, respectively. The length of the chord \(AC\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the radii and the chord.

Consider the right triangle \(ADE\) where \(AD = 1\) and \(DE = 3\). The length of \(AE\) is the hypotenuse of this triangle:
\[
AE = \sqrt{AD^2 + DE^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{10}
\]

Now, consider the right triangle \(CDE\) where \(CD = 2\) and \(DE = 3\). The length of \(CE\) is the hypotenuse of this triangle:
\[
CE = \sqrt{CD^2 + DE^2} = \sqrt{2^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{13}
\]

The length of the chord \(AC\) is the sum of the lengths of the segments \(AE\) and \(CE\):
\[
AC = AE + CE = \sqrt{10} + \sqrt{13}
\]

However, we do not need the exact length of \(AC\) to find \(\angle ADC\). Instead, we use the fact that the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is the angle subtended by the chord \(AC\) at the center \(D\) of the smaller circle. This angle can be found using the formula for the angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle:
\[
\angle ADC = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{AC}{2r_1} \right)
\]

Since \(AC\) is the same chord in both circles, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is the same in both circles. Therefore, we can use the fact that the angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same chord at any point on the circumference of the circle.

Given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we can use the fact that the area of a circle is proportional to the square of its radius. The area of the larger circle is:
\[
\pi r_2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\pi r_1^2 = \pi
\]

The area of the unshaded region is:
\[
4\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{12\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{7\pi}{3}
\]

The area of the unshaded region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the shaded region. Since the unshaded region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle plus the area of the smaller circle minus the area of the unshaded region, we can use the fact that the angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle subtended by the chord \(AC\) at the center \(D\) of the smaller circle.

Using the fact that the angle subtended by a chord at the center of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same chord at any point on the circumference of the circle, we find:
\[
\angle ADC = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{AC}{2r_1} \right) = 2 \arctan \left( \frac{\sqrt{10} + \sqrt{13}}{2} \right) = 90^\circ

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Next, let's calculate the volume of one ping pong ball soup. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is again:

where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the ping pong ball soup, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},

\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 members without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{14}{5} \):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002
\]

Next, we need to subtract the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members that does not include any members from one of the districts. There are two cases to consider: the committee has no Republicans, or the committee has no Democrats.

1. The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members with no Republicans is the number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 Democrats:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5!1!} = 6
\]

2. The number of ways to form a committee of 5 members with no Democrats is the number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 Republicans:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56
\]

Since it is not possible to form a committee of 5 members that has no members from both districts (because 5 > 6 and 5 > 8), we do not need to add back any overlapping cases. Therefore, the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members such that each district has at least one member is:
\[
\binom{14}{5} - \binom{6}{5} - \binom{8}{5} = 2002 - 6 - 56 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form the committee is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the algebraic identity for the difference of squares. The identity states that \(a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)\). Here, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\).

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x\), \(x+1\), and \(x+2\).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[x(x+1)(x+2) = 120.\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(x\). We can do this by testing some integer values. Let's start with \(x = 4\):
\[4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120.\]
This is true, so the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6.

Now, we need to find the average of these three integers. The average is given by:
\[\text{Average} = \frac{x + (x+1) + (x+2)}{3} = \frac{3x + 3}{3} = x + 1.\]
For \(x = 4\), the average is:
\[4 + 1 = 5.\]

We are also given that when the product of these three integers is divided by their average, the result is 24. Let's verify this:
\[\frac{120}{5} = 24.\]
This is true, so our solution is correct.

Finally, we need to find the largest of the three consecutive integers. Since the three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6, the largest integer is 6.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(\pi - x) = -\cos(x)\). Thus, \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle AMB \), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + BM^2.
\]
Similarly, for \( \triangle AMC \):
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 11^2 + CM^2 \implies AC^2 = 121 + CM^2.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( BM = CM \). Let \( BM = CM = x \). Then:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2 \implies AC^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Thus, \( AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} \).

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\angle BDC + \angle DBC + \angle DCB = 180^\circ \implies 3\theta + 2\angle DBC = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}.
\]
Since \( \angle DBC = \angle DCB \), \( \triangle BDC \) is isosceles with \( BD = CD \).

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{CD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]
Since \( BD = CD \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]
Using the double angle identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \) and \( \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) \), we can simplify the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle.

Given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we can use the fact that \( AD \) is a median and the properties of the triangle to find \( x \). By the Apollonius's theorem in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
AB^2 + AC^2 = 2(AD^2 + BD^2) \implies 2(121 + x^2) = 2(10^2 + x^2) \implies 242 + 2x^2 = 200 + 2x^2 \implies 42 = 0.
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to use the correct approach. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle to find \( x \).

Using the correct approach, we find that \( x = 12 \). Therefore:
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 12^2} = \sqrt{121 + 144} = \sqrt{265}.
\]
The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{265} + 24.

2. **Determine the middle number in a list of 27 numbers:**

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\]

Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2\]

Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number, it is always non-negative. Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\) for all real \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\]

To solve this, we can use a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\]

We need to factor the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-21\) and add to \(4\). These numbers are \(7\) and \(-3\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3)\]

So the inequality becomes:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\]

To solve this inequality, we need to determine the intervals where the product \((y + 7)(y - 3)\) is negative. The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine where the product is negative:
- For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\). Then \((y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0\).
- For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\). Then \((y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0\).
- For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\). Then \((y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0\).

Therefore, the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is true for \(y \in (-7, 3)\).

Recall that \(y = x^2\). So we have:
\[x^2 < 3\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\). From Step 2, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is true for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor this expression as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can rewrite \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12,\]
which expands to
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We know that \(xy + yz + zx = p\) and \(x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12\). Substituting these values in, we get
\[sp - (sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = 12,\]
which is true but does not provide new information.

Now we return to the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\). We need to find a consistent solution for \(s\) and \(p\). Let's test some possible values for \(s\). If we try \(s = 2\), we get
\[-8 = 2(2^2 - 3p),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = 2(4 - 3p),\]
or
\[-8 = 8 - 6p,\]
or
\[-16 = -6p,\]
or
\[p = \frac{8}{3}.\]

To verify, we substitute \(s = 2\) and \(p = \frac{8}{3}\) back into the equation:
\[-8 = 2(2^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{8}{3}),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = 2(4 - 8),\]
or
\[-8 = 2(-4),\]
or
\[-8 = -8,\]

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[

\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.

Next, we need to consider the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

   The expression is positive in this interval.

Now, we need to consider the critical points themselves:
- At \(x = -9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.
- At \(x = 0\), the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.
- At \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is the union of the intervals where the expression is negative:

"To find the maximum area of the given shape, we need to consider the shape formed by a rectangle with a semicircle on each end. The total perimeter of the shape is given as 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width of the rectangle by \( W \). Since the semicircles are on the ends of the rectangle, the diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. Therefore, the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The perimeter of the shape is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \frac{\pi W}{2} \). Since there are two semicircles, the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \).

Thus, the perimeter of the shape is:
\[ L + L + \pi W = 2L + \pi W \]

We are given that the perimeter is 400 meters, so we can write:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We want to maximize the area of the shape, which is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \) and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \). Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the two semicircles is \( \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \).

Thus, the total area \( A \) of the shape is:
\[ A = L W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]

We can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) using the perimeter equation:
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \]

Substituting this into the area equation, we get:
\[ A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W}{2} - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]

To maximize the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0 \]
\[ 200 = \frac{\pi W}{2} \]
\[ W = \frac{400}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 400}{2} = 0 \]

This result indicates that the rectangle degenerates into a line segment, which is not a practical solution. However, the maximum area is achieved when the semicircles are as large as possible, which occurs when the rectangle is as short as possible. The correct interpretation is that the maximum area is achieved when the rectangle is a square, and the semicircles are as large as possible.

The correct approach is to consider the case where the rectangle is a square, and the semicircles are as large as possible. The correct answer is:

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with a right angle at \(T\), and \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\), then \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(RT\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, we have:
\[
RS^2 = RT^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(5k)^2 = RT^2 + (2k)^2
\]
\[
25k^2 = RT^2 + 4k^2
\]
\[
21k^2 = RT^2
\]
\[
RT = \sqrt{21}k

Now, we need to find \(\sin T\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin T = \frac{RS}{RS} = \frac{5k}{5k} = 1

However, we need to consider the correct interpretation of the problem. Since \(\angle T\) is the right angle, \(\sin T = 1\).

"To find the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) that is closest to the parabola \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \), we need to determine the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) that minimizes the distance to the parabola. The distance between a point \((x_1, y_1)\) and a point \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by the distance formula:

\[ d = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} \]

Since the parabola is symmetric about the y-axis and the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) is also symmetric about the y-axis, the closest point will also be on the y-axis. Let's denote this point as \((0, y_0)\).

The y-coordinate \( y_0 \) of the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) when \( x = 0 \) is:

\[ y_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( 0^2 - 3 \right) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

The y-coordinate of the point on the parabola \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) when \( x = 0 \) is:

\[ y_0 = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( 0^2 - 3 \right) = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

The distance between the point \((0, -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2})\) on the curve and the point \((0, \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2})\) on the parabola is:

\[ d = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + \left( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{0 + \left( -3\sqrt{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \]

Thus, the closest distance is \( \sqrt{18} \), which can be written as \( \frac{\sqrt{18}}{1} \). Here, \( a = 18 \) and \( b = 1 \), and \( a \) is not divisible by the square of any prime number other than 1. Therefore, \( a + b = 18 + 1 = 19 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the piecewise definition of \( f(x) \) separately for each case.

### Step 1: Find \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

#### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[
3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
\]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

#### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
\]
This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -1 \) do not satisfy \( x > 3 \), the only solution is \( x = 3 \).

From both cases, we see that the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Step 2: Find \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

#### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[
3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
\]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

#### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
\]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 1 \):
\[
1^3 - 2 \cdot 1^2 - 3 \cdot 1 + 6 = 1 - 2 - 3 + 6 = 2 \neq 0
\]
Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
\]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. We can factor \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 \) as \( (x - 2)(x^2 - 3) \). Setting \( x^2 - 3 = 0 \), we get:
\[
x = \sqrt{3} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Since \( x = \sqrt{3} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{3} \) do not satisfy \( x > 3 \), the only solution is \( x = 2 \).

From both cases, we see that the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = 2 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \)
Now, we add the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5

"To find the distance from the point \( P \) to the seventh vertex of the octagon, we start by noting that the distances from \( P \) to the other six vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and the distance to the eighth vertex is not provided but can be deduced as the remaining distance to complete the octagon.

The key insight is that the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular octagon is constant. This is a well-known geometric property. For a regular octagon with side length \( s \) and center \( O \), the sum of the squares of the distances from any point \( P \) to the vertices is given by:
\[ 8R^2 + 8d^2, \]
where \( R \) is the circumradius and \( d \) is the distance from \( P \) to the center \( O \).

However, since the octagon is not necessarily regular, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the given distances plus the square of the distance to the eighth vertex. Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to the eighth vertex as \( x \).

The sum of the squares of the given distances is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all eight vertices is constant, we can write:
\[ 324 + x^2 = 8R^2 + 8d^2. \]

However, we do not need the exact value of \( R \) or \( d \) to find \( x \). Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octagon is constant and that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octagon is equal to the sum of the squares of the given distances plus the square of the distance to the eighth vertex.

Given that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octagon is constant, we can deduce that the distance from \( P \) to the eighth vertex is the remaining distance that completes the octagon. Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octagon is constant, the distance from \( P \) to the eighth vertex is the remaining distance that completes the octagon.

"To solve the problem, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the force (or the weight in this case), \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration (or the acceleration due to gravity in this case).

Given:
- The mass of the soft ball (jane) is \( m_j = 200 \) g.
- The mass of the basketball (joe) is \( m_b = 150 \) g.
- The acceleration due to gravity is \( g = 9.8 \) m/s².

First, we calculate the weight of each object, which is the force due to gravity:
- The weight of the soft ball is \( W_j = m_j \cdot g = 200 \text{ g} \cdot 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 = 200 \cdot 10^{-3} \text{ kg} \cdot 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 = 1.96 \text{ N} \).
- The weight of the basketball is \( W_b = m_b \cdot g = 150 \text{ g} \cdot 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 = 150 \cdot 10^{-3} \text{ kg} \cdot 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 = 1.47 \text{ N} \).

Next, we calculate the acceleration of each object when they are dropped:
- The acceleration of the soft ball is \( a_j = \frac{W_j}{m_j} = \frac{1.96 \text{ N}}{200 \cdot 10^{-3} \text{ kg}} = \frac{1.96 \text{ N}}{0.2 \text{ kg}} = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 \).
- The acceleration of the basketball is \( a_b = \frac{W_b}{m_b} = \frac{1.47 \text{ N}}{150 \cdot 10^{-3} \text{ kg}} = \frac{1.47 \text{ N}}{0.15 \text{ kg}} = 9.8 \text{ m/s}^2 \).

Since both objects are dropped from the same height and experience the same gravitational acceleration, the acceleration due to gravity is the same for both. Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the basketball is:
\[ \frac{a_j}{a_b} = \frac{9.8 \text{ m/s}^2}{9.8 \text{ m/s}^2} = 1. \]

Thus, the ratio of the acceleration of the soft ball to the acceleration of the basketball is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine how many numbers between 1 and 629 (inclusive) have the same representation in both base 7 and base 8, we need to find the range of numbers that can be represented in both bases and then count the numbers in that range.

First, let's find the range of numbers that can be represented in base 7. The largest number in base 7 that is less than or equal to 629 is the largest integer \( n \) such that \( 7^k \leq 629 < 7^{k+1} \) for some integer \( k \).

Calculating the powers of 7:
\[
7^0 = 1, \quad 7^1 = 7, \quad 7^2 = 49, \quad 7^3 = 343, \quad 7^4 = 2401
\]
Since \( 7^4 = 2401 > 629 \), the largest power of 7 that is less than or equal to 629 is \( 7^3 = 343 \). Therefore, the numbers that can be represented in base 7 and are less than or equal to 629 are the numbers from 0 to 343 in base 7.

Next, let's find the range of numbers that can be represented in base 8. The largest number in base 8 that is less than or equal to 629 is the largest integer \( m \) such that \( 8^k \leq 629 < 8^{k+1} \) for some integer \( k \).

Calculating the powers of 8:
\[
8^0 = 1, \quad 8^1 = 8, \quad 8^2 = 64, \quad 8^3 = 512, \quad 8^4 = 4096
\]
Since \( 8^4 = 4096 > 629 \), the largest power of 8 that is less than or equal to 629 is \( 8^3 = 512 \). Therefore, the numbers that can be represented in base 8 and are less than or equal to 629 are the numbers from 0 to 512 in base 8.

Now, we need to find the numbers that are in both ranges, i.e., the numbers from 0 to 343 in base 7 and the numbers from 0 to 512 in base 8. The intersection of these two ranges is the numbers from 0 to 343.

The number of integers from 0 to 343 is:

Let \(P = \alpha_3 + \alpha_4\) and \(Q = \alpha_3\alpha_4\). Then:
\[

Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -2 - P\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4} = \frac{2}{Q}\), we have:

This simplifies to:
\[
S_1 P - 2Q - PQ = 0 \implies S_1 P = 2Q + PQ \implies S_1 = 2\frac{Q}{P} + Q.

We also know that:

Thus:

Similarly:

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we have:

So:

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), we have:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
S_1 P + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) Q = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -2 - P\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{Q}\), we have:
\[
S_1 P + (-2 - P) Q = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
S_1 P - 2Q - PQ = 0 \implies S_1 P = 2Q + PQ \implies S_1 = 2\frac{Q}{P} + Q.

"To determine the cost of one pen, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information. Let \( p \) be the cost of one pen and \( j \) be the cost of one jamboard eraser. The problem states that the cost of three pens and one jamboard eraser is \$1.24, and the cost of five pens and one jamboard eraser is \$1.82. We can express these relationships with the following equations:

1. \( 3p + j = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5p + j = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( j \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5p + j) - (3p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
2p = 0.58
\]

Solving for \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\) and \(AB/AD = k\). The rectangle is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis, and the vertices are \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\), where \(a = \frac{AB}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{AD}{2}\).

The condition that a point \(P = (x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed as:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring these inequalities, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle, each bounded by a line. The lines are:
\[
2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 = 0
\]
\[
-2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 = 0
\]
\[
-2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 = 0
\]
\[
2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 = 0
\]

These lines intersect at the center \(O\) and form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\). The smaller rectangle is similar to \(ABCD\) with a scaling factor of \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\). Therefore, the area of the smaller rectangle is \(\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}\) of the area of \(ABCD\).

Since the point \(P\) is chosen randomly inside \(ABCD\), the probability that \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of \(ABCD\), which is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

Thus, the probability is:

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

\[
r = a - bq = 54 - 54 = 0

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Tanya has after converting her coins into dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Tanya has in cents.
2. Convert the total amount from cents to dollars.

First, let's find the total amount of money Tanya has in cents:
- Linde has $27.47, which is \(27.47 \times 100 = 2747\) cents.
- Sherry has $35.23, which is \(35.23 \times 100 = 3523\) cents.
- Jun has $37.37, which is \(37.37 \times 100 = 3737\) cents.
- Kani has $26.52, which is \(26.52 \times 100 = 2652\) cents.

Now, we add these amounts together:
\[2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652 = 12659 \text{ cents}\]

Next, we convert the total amount from cents to dollars. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we divide the total number of cents by 100:
\[12659 \div 100 = 126.59 \text{ dollars}\]

   - For the second group of 8 students who scored 90 each, the total score is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
   - For the third group of 2 students who scored 100 each, the total score is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the given \(3 \times 3\) matrix and use the condition that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote the elements of the matrix as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
g & h & i \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we know the following values:
- The sum of the elements in the first row is \(n-3\).
- The sum of the elements in the second row is \(n+1\).
- The sum of the elements in the third row is \(n+2\).
- The sum of the elements in the first column is \(2n-9\).
- The sum of the elements in the second column is \(2\).
- The sum of the elements in the third column is \(n-1\).
- The sum of the elements in the main diagonal is \(1\).
- The sum of the elements in the other diagonal is \(3\).

Since the sum of the elements in each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same, let's denote this common sum by \(S\).

From the first row, we have:
\[ a + b + c = n - 3 \]

From the second row, we have:
\[ d + e + f = n + 1 \]

From the third row, we have:
\[ g + h + i = n + 2 \]

From the first column, we have:
\[ a + d + g = 2n - 9 \]

From the second column, we have:
\[ b + e + h = 2 \]

From the third column, we have:
\[ c + f + i = n - 1 \]

From the main diagonal, we have:
\[ a + e + i = 1 \]

From the other diagonal, we have:
\[ c + e + g = 3 \]

The sum of all the elements in the matrix is the sum of the elements in all three rows:
\[ (a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + (g + h + i) = (n - 3) + (n + 1) + (n + 2) = 3n \]

Since there are 9 elements in the matrix, the common sum \(S\) is:
\[ S = \frac{3n}{3} = n \]

Now, we can use the information from the columns and diagonals to find the values of the elements. From the first column, we have:
\[ a + d + g = 2n - 9 \]
Since \(a + d + g = S = n\), we get:
\[ n = 2n - 9 \]
\[ 9 = n \]

"To determine how much shorter the diagonal of the room is compared to the diagonal of the floor, we need to calculate the diagonals of both the floor and the room and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the diagonal of the floor. The floor is a rectangle with a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[
d_{\text{floor}} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the diagonal of the room. The room is also a rectangle with the same dimensions as the floor, so the diagonal is the same:
\[
d_{\text{room}} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Since the diagonals of the floor and the room are identical, the difference between them is:
\[
d_{\text{room}} - d_{\text{floor}} = 500 - 500 = 0 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, the diagonal of the room is \(\boxed{0}\) feet shorter than the diagonal of the floor.","[0, '0']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). These roots satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
