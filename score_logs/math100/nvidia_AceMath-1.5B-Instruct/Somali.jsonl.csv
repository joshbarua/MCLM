"To find the maximum length of \( DE \) in the right triangle \( DEF \) where \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( DF = 7 \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the relationship between the sides and the angle:**
   Since \( \sin D = 0.7 \), we know that the opposite side to angle \( D \) (which is \( EF \)) divided by the hypotenuse (which is \( DF \)) is 0.7. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
   \]
   Given that \( DF = 7 \), we can find \( EF \) as follows:
   \[
   EF = 0.7 \times 7 = 4.9
   \]

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \( DE \):**
   In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, \( DF \) is the hypotenuse, \( EF \) is one leg, and \( DE \) is the other leg. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   7^2 = DE^2 + 4.9^2
   \]
   Simplifying the squares:
   \[
   49 = DE^2 + 24.01
   \]
   Solving for \( DE^2 \):
   \[
   DE^2 = 49 - 24.01 = 24.99
   \]
   Taking the square root of both sides:
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{24.99} \approx 4.999
   \]

3. **Round to the nearest whole number:**
   Since the problem asks for the maximum length of \( DE \) and the value 4.999 is very close to 5, we can round it to the nearest whole number, which is 5.

Therefore, the maximum length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that the angle between the vectors \( c \) and \( w \) is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( w \) lies on the line passing through the origin and \( z \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in terms of their real and imaginary parts:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Find the argument (angle) of \( c \):**
   The argument \( \theta_c \) of \( c \) is given by:
   \[
   \theta_c = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)
   \]

3. **Find the argument of \( z \):**
   The argument \( \theta_z \) of \( z \) is given by:
   \[
   \theta_z = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference in arguments:**
   The angle between \( c \) and \( z \) is:
   \[
   \theta_z - \theta_c
   \]

5. **Find the argument of \( w \):**
   Since \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) around the origin, the argument of \( w \) is:
   \[
   \theta_w = \theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

6. **Express \( w \) in terms of its real and imaginary parts:**
   The real part of \( w \) is:
   \[
   \text{Re}(w) = |w| \cos(\theta_w)
   \]
   The imaginary part of \( w \) is:
   \[
   \text{Im}(w) = |w| \sin(\theta_w)
   \]

7. **Determine the magnitude \( |w| \):**
   Since \( w \) lies on the line passing through the origin and \( z \), the magnitude \( |w| \) is the same as the magnitude of \( z \):
   \[
   |w| = |z| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}))^2}
   \]

8. **Calculate \( |z| \):**
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (3 + 3\sqrt{2})^2}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{(4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2) + (9 + 18\sqrt{2} + 18)}
   \]
   \[
   = \sqrt{33 + 22\sqrt{2}}
   \]

9. **Find the coordinates of \( w \):**
   \[
   \text{Re}(w) = |w| \cos\left(\theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Im}(w) = |w| \sin\left(\theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]

10. **Simplify the expressions:**
    Using the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine:
    \[
    \cos\left(\theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \cos(\theta_z) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \sin(\theta_z) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
    \]
    \[
    \sin\left(\theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin(\theta_z) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \cos(\theta_z) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
    \]

    Since \( \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we have:
    \[
    \cos\left(\theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos(\theta_z) - \sin(\theta_z))
    \]
    \[
    \sin\left(\theta_z + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\sin(\theta_z) + \cos(\theta_z))
    \]

11. **Substitute the values:**
    \[
    \text{Re}(w) = |w| \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos(\theta_z) - \sin(\theta_z))
    \]
    \[
    \text{Im}(w) = |w| \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\sin(\theta_z) + \cos(\theta_z))
    \]

12. **Calculate the final coordinates:**
    After substituting the values of \( \cos(\theta_z) \) and \( \sin(\theta_z) \) and simplifying, we find:
    \[
    w = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
    \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We know that:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

So, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can simplify the square root by taking the square root of each factor. Since \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), we have:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To expand the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The expansion will be:

\[

We will calculate each term in the sum separately.

1. For \(k = 0\):
\[

4. For \(k = 3\):
\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot (10x^3)^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 10^2 x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8x^6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To solve the problem, we need to show that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\) given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):
\[

The value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) is \(x + y\). Since \(x > 7\), the maximum value of \(x + y\) will be achieved when \(x\) is as large as possible and \(y\) is as large as possible.

"To find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function.

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0.\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0,\]
\[x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2.\]
So, the vertical asymptotes are at \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). Therefore, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator \(P(x) = 2x\) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \(Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14\) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). Therefore, \(c = 0\).

"To determine if \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is a prime number, we can start by simplifying the expression. Notice that \(99^2 + 99\) can be factored as follows:

\[
99^2 + 99 = 99(99 + 1) = 99 \cdot 100 = 9900
\]

So, the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) becomes:

\[
9900 + 1 = 9901
\]

Now, we need to check if 9901 is a prime number. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if 9901 is prime, we can test for divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 9901. The square root of 9901 is approximately 99.5, so we need to test divisibility by all prime numbers less than 100.

Let's test the divisibility of 9901 by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, and 97.

- 9901 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 9901 is \(9 + 9 + 0 + 1 = 19\), which is not divisible by 3, so 9901 is not divisible by 3.
- 9901 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- To check divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \(9901 \div 7 \approx 1414.4286\), which is not an integer, so 9901 is not divisible by 7.
- To check divisibility by 11, we use the alternating sum of the digits: \(9 - 9 + 0 - 1 = -1\), which is not divisible by 11, so 9901 is not divisible by 11.
- We continue this process for all prime numbers up to 97. After performing these checks, we find that 9901 is not divisible by any of these prime numbers.

This constant \( C \) is the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):

\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}
\]
\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{32}{2} = 16, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{2}{2} = 1

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are 16 and 1. The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, which are \(\sqrt{16} = 4\) and \(\sqrt{1} = 1\). The largest singular value is 4. Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is 4.

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.
\]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we first need to convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10, perform the subtraction in base 10, and then convert the result back to base 9.

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10
The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53\]
So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10
The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]
Calculating the value, we get:
\[1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17\]
So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10
Now, we subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base 9
To convert \(36\) from base 10 to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the numerators:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified expression is:
\[
\cot x.
\]

\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of the cylindrical saxda given its volume and radius, and then find the height when the volume is doubled.

First, we start with the formula for the volume of a cylinder:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height.

We are given that the volume \( V \) is \( 20\pi \) cubic units and the radius \( r \) is 2 units. We need to find the height \( h \).

Substituting the given values into the volume formula, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi (2)^2 h \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4h \]

Next, we solve for \( h \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ h = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

So, the height of the cylindrical saxda is 5 units.

Now, we need to find the height when the volume is doubled. The new volume \( V' \) is:
\[ V' = 2 \times 20\pi = 40\pi \]

Using the same radius \( r = 2 \) units, we substitute the new volume into the volume formula:
\[ 40\pi = \pi (2)^2 h' \]

Again, we simplify by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 40 = 4h' \]

Next, we solve for \( h' \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ h' = \frac{40}{4} = 10 \]

So, the height of the cylindrical saxda when the volume is doubled is 10 units.

Therefore, the height when the volume is doubled is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{5},[],False
"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is equal to the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both are equal to \(f(a)\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} ax^2 = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

Next, we find the left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a. \]

We can rearrange this equation to:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\) from the equation, we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression \(a^2 - a - 2\):
\[ a^2 - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1). \]

So, the equation becomes:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]

Setting each factor equal to zero, we find the solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

However, we need to check which of these values of \(a\) make the function continuous. The function \(f(x)\) is defined such that \(x \geq a\), so \(a\) must be a real number that does not make the function undefined or discontinuous in the context of the problem. Since \(a = 0\) would make the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a = 0\) for \(x < 0\) and \(f(x) = ax^2 = 0\) for \(x \geq 0\), which is continuous, \(a = 0\) is a valid solution.

Therefore, the value of \(a\) that makes the function \(f(x)\) continuous is:
\[ \boxed{2} \] (since \(a = 0\) and \(a = -1\) are not valid in the context of the problem).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) terms and the \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract \(25\) inside the equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract \(9\) inside the equation:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, we substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\). To solve for \( c \), we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Subtract 34 from both sides:
\[ -c = 1 - 34 \]
\[ -c = -33 \]
Multiply both sides by -1:
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that for any \(x \in [0,1]\), if \(f(x) \neq x\), then \(f(f(x)) = x\). The function is given by \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
This inequality is satisfied for \(1 \le \lambda \le 2\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(1 \le \lambda \le 2\).

Next, we need to ensure that for any \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's consider the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) and its properties.

For \(\lambda = 0\), \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), so \(f(f(x)) = 0 \neq x\) for \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 0\) does not satisfy the condition.

For \(\lambda = 4\), \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\). The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{4 - 1}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\). For \(x \in [0, \frac{3}{4}) \cup (\frac{3}{4}, 1]\), \(f(x) \neq x\). We need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\) for these values of \(x\).

Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2).
\]
Expanding the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
1 - 4x + 4x^2 = (2x - 1)^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(2x - 1)^2.
\]
We need to show that \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \in [0, \frac{3}{4}) \cup (\frac{3}{4}, 1]\). This is a more complex algebraic problem, but it can be shown that for \(\lambda = 4\), \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\).

For \(1 < \lambda < 2\), the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). The function \(f(x)\) is a parabola opening downwards with its maximum at \(x = \frac{\lambda}{2}\). For \(x \in [0, \frac{\lambda}{2}]\), \(f(x) \ge 0\), and for \(x \in [\frac{\lambda}{2}, 1]\), \(f(x) \le 0\). The condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) is more complex to verify, but it can be shown that it holds for \(\lambda = 4\).

Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 4\).

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) subject to the constraints \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we will use a combination of calculus and symmetry arguments.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions and some symmetry. Notice that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric with respect to the line \( y = x \). Therefore, it is reasonable to check the values of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary of the square \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\).

1. **Check the boundary \( x = 1 \):**
   \[
   f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

2. **Check the boundary \( x = -1 \):**
   \[
   f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(-1, 0) = 0 \).

3. **Check the boundary \( y = 1 \):**
   \[
   f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

4. **Check the boundary \( y = -1 \):**
   \[
   f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}
   \]
   The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, -1) = 0 \).

From the above boundary checks, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1, which occurs at the points \( (1, 0) \) and \( (0, 1) \).

To confirm that this is indeed the maximum value inside the square, we can use the second derivative test or consider the behavior of the function in the interior. However, given the symmetry and the boundary values, it is clear that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is achieved on the boundary.

\[ t^2 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} t + 1 = 0. \]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and \( c = 1 \):
\[ t = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]
Thus, the roots are:
\[ z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} + \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \quad \text{and} \quad z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]
These roots are the golden ratio and its reciprocal, which are \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} + \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \) and \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} - \frac{\sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4} \), respectively.

However, it is known that these roots can be expressed in terms of the golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \). The roots are \( \phi^2 \) and \( \frac{1}{\phi^2} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = \phi \) or \( z = \frac{1}{\phi} \), we have:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}}. \]
Using the property of the golden ratio \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), we can express higher powers of \( \phi \) in terms of \( \phi \) and 1. We know that:
\[ \phi^3 = \phi^2 + \phi = \phi + 1 + \phi = 2\phi + 1, \]
\[ \phi^4 = \phi^3 + \phi^2 = (2\phi + 1) + (\phi + 1) = 3\phi + 2, \]
and so on. The sequence of coefficients follows the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, \( \phi^{85} \) can be written as a linear combination of \( \phi \) and 1 with coefficients that are Fibonacci numbers.

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \). The 85th Fibonacci number is \( F_{85} \). Thus:
\[ \phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} = F_{86}. \]
The 86th Fibonacci number is 18742248246240. Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the relationship between the sides of the triangles \(ABC\) and \(GBC\). Given that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\), it divides each median in the ratio 2:1. This means that if \(M\) and \(N\) are the midpoints of \(BC\) and \(AC\) respectively, then \(AG:GM = 2:1\) and \(AG:GN = 2:1\).

The area of triangle \(GBC\) is one-third of the area of triangle \(ABC\) because the centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(GBC\) is:

where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cube. In this problem, the base of the cube is a square with side length 30 unug, and the height is 6.5 unug. First, we need to calculate the area of the base \( B \):

"To determine the number of zeros at the end of the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\), we need to follow these steps:

1. Simplify the fraction.
2. Determine the number of factors of 10 in the simplified fraction.
3. The number of factors of 10 is equal to the number of zeros at the end of the decimal representation.

Let's start with the fraction:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125} = \frac{21}{312500}
\]

Next, we need to determine the number of factors of 10 in the fraction. A factor of 10 is composed of a factor of 2 and a factor of 5. In the denominator \(4 \cdot 78125\), we have:
- 4, which has 2 factors of 2.
- 78125, which has 0 factors of 2 and 7 factors of 5.

Since the numerator 21 has no factors of 2 or 5, the number of factors of 10 in the fraction is the limiting factor between the number of factors of 2 and the number of factors of 5. Here, the number of factors of 2 is 2 and the number of factors of 5 is 7. Therefore, the number of factors of 10 is 2.

"To determine the \( n \)-th term of the sequence defined by the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 1 \) with the initial term \( a_1 = 1 \), we first need to find a general formula for \( a_n \).

First, let's rewrite the recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} + 1 = 2(a_n + 1). \]
This shows that the sequence \( b_n = a_n + 1 \) is a geometric sequence with the first term \( b_1 = a_1 + 1 = 2 \) and common ratio 2. The general term of a geometric sequence is given by:
\[ b_n = b_1 \cdot r^{n-1}. \]
For our sequence, this becomes:
\[ b_n = 2 \cdot 2^{n-1} = 2^n. \]
Since \( b_n = a_n + 1 \), we have:
\[ a_n = 2^n - 1. \]
Thus, the \( n \)-th term of the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^n - 1. \]

Next, we need to find the \( n \)-th term of the sequence in terms of \( n^{\text{th}} \) power. We know that:
\[ a_n = 2^n - 1. \]
To express \( 2^n \) in terms of \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, we use the fact that \( 2^n = (2^{\log_2 n})^n = n^n \). Therefore, the \( n \)-th term of the sequence is:
\[ a_n = n^n - 1. \]

However, the problem asks for the \( n \)-th term in terms of \( n^{\text{th}} \) power, which is simply \( n^n \). Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of distinct paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 3x4 grid, where each path consists of moves of 1 unit either right or down. This is a classic combinatorial problem that can be solved using binomial coefficients.

In a 3x4 grid, we need to make exactly 3 moves down and 4 moves right to get from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. The total number of moves is 7, and we need to choose 3 of these moves to be down (the remaining 4 will automatically be right). The number of ways to choose 3 moves out of 7 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{3}\).

The binomial coefficient \(\binom{7}{3}\) is calculated as follows:

The tirooyinka can continue their waxing process as long as they have at least 1 unit of wax left.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. On the first day, the tirooyinka uses 1 unit of wax from the first supply, so they have 3 units left.

Now, we need to check if 4321 is divisible by any of the prime factors of the denominator, which are 2 and 5. Since 4321 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. To check if it is divisible by 5, we look at the last digit of 4321, which is 1. Since 1 is not 0 or 5, 4321 is not divisible by 5.

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms in the product as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.

Thus, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the product becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.

To find \(\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ\), we can use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. However, a simpler approach is to use known results or symmetry properties of the sine function. It is known that:

   - In cylindrical coordinates, a point in 3-dimensional space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
     - \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
     - \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
     - \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Given Equation: \( z = c \):**
   - This equation states that the height \( z \) is a constant.
   - For any value of \( r \) and \( \theta \), the value of \( z \) remains \( c \).

3. **Interpreting the Equation:**
   - The equation \( z = c \) describes a surface where the height is fixed at \( c \) regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).
   - This means that for any point on this surface, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \).

4. **Identifying the Surface:**
   - In 3-dimensional space, a surface where the \( z \)-coordinate is constant is a plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane.
   - Specifically, the surface \( z = c \) is a horizontal plane at height \( c \).

where \(\theta\) is the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To find the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to determine the roots of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \). The roots of \( g(x) \) will be the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x+5) = 0 \). This means that if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) will be a root of \( g(x) \).

First, we need to find the roots of \( f(x) \). We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem suggests that any rational root of the polynomial \( f(x) \) is a factor of the constant term (-2015) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (1). Therefore, the possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 5, \pm 13, \pm 31, \pm 65, \pm 155, \pm 2015 \).

Let's test these possible roots:

1. Testing \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   f(1) = 1^3 - 49 \cdot 1^2 + 623 \cdot 1 - 2015 = 1 - 49 + 623 - 2015 = -1440 \neq 0

   So, \( x = 5 \) is a root.

Since \( x = 5 \) is a root, we can factor \( f(x) \) as \( (x-5)q(x) \), where \( q(x) \) is a quadratic polynomial. We can use polynomial division to find \( q(x) \).

Performing the division of \( f(x) \) by \( x-5 \):

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
  5 & 1 & -49 & 623 & -2015 \\
    &   & 5  & -220 & 1965 \\
  \hline
    & 1 & -44 & 393 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

So, \( q(x) = x^2 - 44x + 393 \). Now, we need to find the roots of the quadratic polynomial \( x^2 - 44x + 393 \). We can use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -44 \), and \( c = 393 \):

\[
x = \frac{44 \pm \sqrt{(-44)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 393}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{44 \pm \sqrt{1936 - 1572}}{2} = \frac{44 \pm \sqrt{364}}{2} = \frac{44 \pm 2\sqrt{91}}{2} = 22 \pm \sqrt{91}
\]

So, the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( 5 \), \( 22 + \sqrt{91} \), and \( 22 - \sqrt{91} \).

Since the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) are \( r - 5 \) for each root \( r \) of \( f(x) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[
5 - 5 = 0, \quad (22 + \sqrt{91}) - 5 = 17 + \sqrt{91}, \quad (22 - \sqrt{91}) - 5 = 17 - \sqrt{91}
\]

Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \(\boxed{0, 17 + \sqrt{91}, 17 - \sqrt{91}}\).","[{0, 17 - sqrt(91), sqrt(91) + 17}, '0, 17 + \\sqrt{91}, 17 - \\sqrt{91}']",34,"[34, '34']",False
"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). This gives us:
\[
\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to rewrite the expression in terms of cosine:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We will use the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) to express each term in the form of \(\cos 2x\):
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the cosines of angles in arithmetic progression. The identity states that:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 (60^\circ - x)} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 (60^\circ + x)} = 9.
\]

In our case, we can set \(x = 10^\circ\), \(60^\circ - x = 50^\circ\), and \(60^\circ + x = 70^\circ\). Therefore, the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ}\) is equal to 9.

Thus, the value of the original expression is:

"To determine if the sum of the interior angles of a polygon can be \(1070^\circ\), we need to use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

We need to find if there exists an integer \(n\) such that:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070

First, we solve for \(n\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

\[
n-2 = \frac{107}{18}
\]

\[
n-2 \approx 5.9444

Since \(n\) must be an integer, and \(n-2\) is approximately 5.9444, it is not an integer. Therefore, there is no integer \(n\) that satisfies the equation \(180(n-2) = 1070\).

Thus, the sum of the interior angles of a polygon cannot be \(1070^\circ\).

We can simplify this congruence by subtracting \( t \) from both sides:

\[ 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to first understand the relationship between the inverse trigonometric functions \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\).

Recall that for any positive real number \(x\),
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x).
\]
This is because the cotangent of an angle is the reciprocal of the tangent of that angle, and the inverse cotangent function is the angle whose cotangent is the given value. Therefore, if \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\cot(\theta) = \frac{1}{x}\), and thus \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\).

Given this identity, the expression inside the sine function simplifies as follows:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x) + \tan^{-1}(x) = 2 \tan^{-1}(x).
\]
So the original equation becomes:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
We use the double-angle identity for sine, which states that \(\sin(2\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). Then \(\sin(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the double-angle identity, we get:
\[
\sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1}(x) \right) = 2 \sin(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation now is:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

Since \(x\) must be positive, we take the positive root:

First, let's calculate the lengths of the sides:
- The distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) is:
  \[
  \sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10

- The distance between \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) is:
  \[
  \sqrt{((-5) - (-5))^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8

- The distance between \((-5,-4)\) and \((5,-4)\) is:
  \[
  \sqrt{((-5) - 5)^2 + ((-4) - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{(-10)^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10
  \]
- The distance between \((5,-4)\) and \((5,4)\) is:
  \[
  \sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + ((-4) - 4)^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + (-8)^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8
  \]

From the above calculations, we can see that the opposite sides are equal:
- The length of the side between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) is 10, which is equal to the length of the side between \((-5,-4)\) and \((5,-4)\).
- The length of the side between \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) is 8, which is equal to the length of the side between \((5,-4)\) and \((5,4)\).

Next, let's calculate the lengths of the diagonals:
- The distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) is:
  \[
  \sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{100 + 64} = \sqrt{164} = 2\sqrt{41}

From the above calculations, we can see that the diagonals are equal:
- The length of the diagonal between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) is \(2\sqrt{41}\), which is equal to the length of the diagonal between \((-5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\).

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we get

\]

We can further distribute the cross products:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

Combining these results, we have

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AB = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as one of the legs and \(\overline{CD}\) as the other leg. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD

Next, we need to find the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\). The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]

To find \([\triangle ABC]\), we note that \(\overline{AC}\) is also a common side for both \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\) and \(\overline{CD}\) respectively, but with different bases. The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot h
\]
where \(h\) is the height from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\).

However, we can also express the area of \(\triangle ABC\) in terms of the area of \(\triangle ACD\) and the ratio of the bases \(BC\) and \(CD\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{c} \cdot [\triangle ACD]
\]

Substituting this into the equation for the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we get:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + \frac{b}{c} \cdot [\triangle ACD]
\]
\[
42 = \left(1 + \frac{b}{c}\right) \cdot [\triangle ACD]

To find \(\frac{b}{c}\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude of both triangles and the trapezoid. The area of the trapezoid can also be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot h
\]
where \(h\) is the height from \(\overline{AD}\) to \(\overline{BC}\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude, we can also express the area of the trapezoid as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot h = \frac{1}{2} \cdot (a + b) \cdot \frac{2 \cdot 42}{a + b} = 42
\]

However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is proportional to the area of \(\triangle ACD\) by the ratio of the bases:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{c} \cdot [\triangle ACD]
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude, the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases:
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{c} \cdot [\triangle ACD]
\]

Substituting this into the equation for the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we get:
\[
42 = \left(1 + \frac{b}{c}\right) \cdot [\triangle ACD]
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude, the ratio of the areas is the same as the ratio of the bases:
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{b}{c}

Thus, we have:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{c} \cdot [\triangle ACD]

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given definition of the operation \( @ \). The definition states that \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\).

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

To simplify this, we multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\):
\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = \frac{70 \times 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the lengths of segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) given that the areas of triangles \(ABC\) and \(CDA\) are equal. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangles.

Given:
- Triangles \(ABC\) and \(CDA\) have equal areas.
- \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are points in a plane.

We need to find the relationship between the lengths of segments \(AB\) and \(CD\).

First, let's denote the areas of triangles \(ABC\) and \(CDA\) as \( \text{Area}(\triangle ABC) \) and \( \text{Area}(\triangle CDA) \), respectively. According to the problem, these areas are equal:
\[
\text{Area}(\triangle ABC) = \text{Area}(\triangle CDA)
\]

The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

For triangle \(ABC\), the base can be \(BC\) and the height is the perpendicular distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). For triangle \(CDA\), the base can be \(DA\) and the height is the perpendicular distance from \(C\) to \(DA\).

Since the areas of the triangles are equal, we can write:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height from } A \text{ to } BC = \frac{1}{2} \times DA \times \text{height from } C \text{ to } DA
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
BC \times \text{height from } A \text{ to } BC = DA \times \text{height from } C \text{ to } DA
\]

Now, let's consider the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\). The length of a segment is the straight-line distance between its endpoints. The relationship between the lengths of \(AB\) and \(CD\) depends on the specific configuration of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

However, without additional information about the specific positions of the points, we cannot determine a specific numerical relationship between \(AB\) and \(CD\). The problem does not provide enough information to find a unique relationship between the lengths of \(AB\) and \(CD\).

Therefore, the answer is that we cannot determine the relationship between the lengths of segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) based on the given information.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) given the information about the radio stations and the fraction of the time they are active.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( t_1 \) be the time in hours that the radio station with radius 1 is active.
- Let \( t_2 \) be the time in hours that the radio station with radius 2 is active.

The total time the radio stations are active is the sum of \( t_1 \) and \( t_2 \). According to the problem, the fraction of the time that the radio station with radius 1 is active is \( \frac{5}{12} \). Therefore, we can write:
\[ \frac{t_1}{t_1 + t_2} = \frac{5}{12} \]

To find \( t_1 \) in terms of \( t_2 \), we can cross-multiply:
\[ 12t_1 = 5(t_1 + t_2) \]
\[ 12t_1 = 5t_1 + 5t_2 \]
\[ 7t_1 = 5t_2 \]
\[ t_1 = \frac{5}{7}t_2 \]

Now, we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \). The measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is given by the formula for the angle subtended by two chords in a circle:
\[ \angle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{t_1}{t_1 + t_2} \times 360^\circ + \frac{t_2}{t_1 + t_2} \times 360^\circ \right) \]

However, since the sum of the fractions is 1, the formula simplifies to:
\[ \angle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 360^\circ = 180^\circ \]

Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is:
\[ \boxed{90^\circ} \]","[90, '90^\\circ']",120,"[120, '120']",False
"To determine the volume of the liquid that needs to be added to the beaker to increase its radius from 3 cm to 6 cm, we need to calculate the volume of the additional liquid that corresponds to the increase in radius. The beaker is cylindrical, so the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

First, let's find the volume of the liquid in the beaker when the radius is 3 cm. Let the height of the liquid be \( h \). The volume \( V_1 \) is:

\[ V_1 = \pi (3)^2 h = 9\pi h \]

Next, let's find the volume of the liquid in the beaker when the radius is 6 cm. The volume \( V_2 \) is:

\[ V_2 = \pi (6)^2 h = 36\pi h \]

The additional volume of liquid added is the difference between \( V_2 \) and \( V_1 \):

\[ V_{\text{additional}} = V_2 - V_1 = 36\pi h - 9\pi h = 27\pi h \]

Since the height \( h \) of the liquid is the same in both cases, it cancels out in the expression for the additional volume. Therefore, the additional volume of liquid added is:

\[ V_{\text{additional}} = 27\pi h \]

However, since the height \( h \) is not specified, we can only express the additional volume in terms of \( h \). If we assume the height \( h \) is the same as the height of the liquid in the beaker, the additional volume of liquid added is:

\[ \boxed{27\pi h} \]

If we need a numerical value, we would need the height \( h \). But based on the problem, the additional volume of liquid added is:

\[ \boxed{27\pi h} \] cubic centimeters.","[27*pi*h, '27\\pi h']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. Next, we need to solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\). First, move 4096 to the left side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0
   \]

4. We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]
   Simplifying inside the square root and the rest of the expression, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 16368}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}
   \]
   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two possible solutions:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are \(x = 66\) and \(x = -62\). The final answer is:

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so we have:

\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

Therefore, the original expression is:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). We are also given that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(AM\) is the altitude from \(A\) to \(BC\). Let \(BC = 2a\). Then \(BM = MC = a\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + a^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + a^2.
\]

Next, we use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\). In \(\triangle BDC\), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = 2R,
\]
where \(R\) is the circumradius of \(\triangle BDC\). Since \(BC = 2a\), we get:
\[
\frac{2a}{\sin 3\theta} = 2R \implies \frac{a}{\sin 3\theta} = R.
\]

Now, we use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BAC} = 2R,
\]
where \(BC = 2a\) and \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, we get:
\[
\frac{2a}{\sin \theta} = 2R \implies \frac{a}{\sin \theta} = R.
\]

Since both expressions equal \(R\), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
\frac{a}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{a}{\sin \theta} \implies \sin 3\theta = \sin \theta.
\]

Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we get:
\[
3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta = \sin \theta \implies 2\sin \theta = 4\sin^3 \theta \implies \sin \theta = 2\sin^3 \theta \implies \sin \theta (1 - 2\sin^2 \theta) = 0.
\]

Since \(\sin \theta \neq 0\), we have:
\[
1 - 2\sin^2 \theta = 0 \implies 2\sin^2 \theta = 1 \implies \sin^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \implies \sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\]

Therefore, \(\theta = 45^\circ\). So, \(\angle BAC = 45^\circ\) and \(\angle BDC = 135^\circ\).

Now, we can find \(AB\):
\[
AB^2 = 121 + a^2.
\]

Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, we have:
\[
a^2 = BM^2 = AB^2 - 121.
\]

However, we don't need the exact value of \(a\) to find \(AB\). We can use the fact that \(\sin 45^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) and the relationship between the sides of the triangle. Since \(\angle BAC = 45^\circ\), the triangle is a 45-45-90 triangle, and the sides are in the ratio \(1:1:\sqrt{2}\). Therefore, \(AB = AC = 11\sqrt{2}\).

Thus, the length of \(AB\) is:

"To determine the maximum number of dhex dhexaadkooda that can be formed from the number \(3^7\), we first need to calculate the value of \(3^7\).

Next, we need to find the maximum number of dhex dhexaadkooda that can be formed from the number 2187. A dhex dhexaadkooda is a number that consists of 16 hexadecimal digits, and each hexadecimal digit can take any value from 0 to 15. Therefore, the maximum number of dhex dhexaadkooda that can be formed is simply the number of times 16 can be subtracted from the number of digits in 2187.

First, we count the number of digits in 2187. The number 2187 has 4 digits.

Since 16 is greater than 4, the maximum number of dhex dhexaadkooda that can be formed is 0.

"To solve the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0 \]

Notice that \( x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 \) is a perfect square trinomial:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2 \]

Since the square of any real number is always non-negative, \( (x^2 + 2)^2 \geq 0 \). Therefore, \( (x^2 + 2)^2 > 0 \) for all real \( x \).

Thus, the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \) is always true for all real \( x \).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0 \]

Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

We need to solve the quadratic inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \). First, find the roots of the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

This gives us two roots:
\[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7 \]

The quadratic \( y^2 + 4y - 21 \) factors as:
\[ (y - 3)(y + 7) \]

The quadratic \( (y - 3)(y + 7) \) is negative between the roots \( -7 \) and \( 3 \). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is:
\[ -7 < y < 3 \]

Recall that \( y = x^2 \). Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), we discard the negative part of the interval:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we can use some algebraic identities and substitutions.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\). We can rewrite this as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using the identity \(x+y+z = s\) and \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we can express \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12.\]
Expanding and combining like terms, we have
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
We can rewrite the left-hand side as
\[s^2p - (x^3 + y^3 + z^3 + x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
Using the identity \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we substitute \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\):
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4 + 3 \cdot 4 = 16.\]
Thus, the equation becomes
\[s^2p - (16 + x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y) = 12.\]
We know that \(x^2y + x^2z + y^2x + y^2z + z^2x + z^2y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12\). Substituting this into the equation, we get
\[s^2p - (16 + sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[s^2p - sp - 4 = 12,\]
or
\[s^2p - sp = 16.\]
Factoring out \(sp\) on the left-hand side, we have
\[sp(s - 1) = 16.\]

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(sp(s - 1) = 16\).

We can solve these equations simultaneously. From the second equation, we solve for \(p\):
\[p = \frac{16}{s(s-1)}.\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{16}{s(s-1)}\right),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{48}{s-1}\right),\]
or
\[-8 = s^3 - \frac{48s}{s-1}.\]
Multiplying through by \(s-1\), we get
\[-8(s-1) = s^3(s-1) - 48s,\]
or
\[-8s + 8 = s^4 - s^3 - 48s,\]
which simplifies to
\[s^4 - s^3 - 40s + 8 = 0.\]
We test possible rational roots of this polynomial. Testing \(s = 2\), we get

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 81\) can be factored as \((x-9)(x+9)\), so the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0.
\]
The absolute value function \(|x^2 - 81|\) is always non-negative, and it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). Therefore, the inequality \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\) will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative, because the numerator is non-negative and zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\).

Next, we need to determine the intervals where the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. The roots of the denominator are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression \(x(x-36)\) in that interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\). Then \(x(x-36) = -1(-1-36) = 37\), which is positive.
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), choose \(x = 18\). Then \(x(x-36) = 18(18-36) = 18(-18) = -324\), which is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\). Then \(x(x-36) = 37(37-36) = 37\), which is positive.

Therefore, the expression \(x(x-36)\) is negative in the interval \((0, 36)\).

However, we must also consider the points where the numerator is zero, which are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). At these points, the numerator is zero, so the expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) is zero, not negative. Therefore, these points are not included in the solution set.

3. **Total Mitir**: To find the total number of mitir, we add the initial mitir to the additional mitir.

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by understanding the relationship between the sides of the triangle and the sine function. In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse.

Given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can denote the length of the opposite side to angle \(R\) as 2 and the hypotenuse as 5. Let the length of the adjacent side to angle \(R\) be \(x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \(x\):

\[
x^2 + 2^2 = 5^2
\]
\[
x^2 + 4 = 25
\]
\[
x^2 = 21
\]
\[
x = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\), and since one of the angles is \(90^\circ\), the other two angles must sum to \(90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle T\) is the complement of \(\angle R\), i.e., \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\).

The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Thus, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\). We can find \(\cos{R}\) using the adjacent side and the hypotenuse:

\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Therefore, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

"To find the value of \(a + b\) where the minimum value of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) is given by \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), we start by analyzing the function.

The function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) is a quadratic function in the form \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\), where \(a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), \(b = 0\), and \(c = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\). Since the coefficient of \(x^2\) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value occurs at the vertex.

The vertex of a parabola given by \(y = ax^2 + bx + c\) is located at \(x = -\frac{b}{2a}\). For our function, \(b = 0\) and \(a = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\), so the vertex occurs at:
\[
x = -\frac{0}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}} = 0
\]

Next, we substitute \(x = 0\) back into the function to find the minimum value:
\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot (-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{2}\):
\[
-\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The minimum value of the function is \(-\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}\), which is in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\) where \(a = 18\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = 18 + 2 = 20\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{cases} \]

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
Factoring the quadratic expression:
\[ x(-x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 \]
Setting each factor to zero:
\[ x = 0, \quad x = -1, \quad x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -1 \) do not satisfy \( x > 3 \), the only solution is \( x = 3 \).

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ -x = 3 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. We can factor \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 \) as:
\[ -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) \]
Setting \( -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) = 0 \):
\[ x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = -3 \]
Since \( x^2 = -3 \) has no real solutions, the only real solution is \( x = 2 \).

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = 2 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

The answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}

"To determine the number of faces of the polyhedron \(P\) with the given edge lengths \(3, 7, 8, 9, 11\), we need to analyze the structure of the polyhedron and use the properties of polyhedra.

First, let's identify the polyhedron. The polyhedron has 6 vertices and 12 edges, which suggests it could be a type of semi-regular polyhedron or a more complex polyhedron. However, the most likely candidate given the edge lengths is a polyhedron with a specific geometric structure.

The polyhedron described in the problem is a type of semi-regular polyhedron known as a ""triangular bipyramid"" or ""double tetrahedron."" This polyhedron has two tetrahedra joined at a common face, resulting in 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces.

To verify, let's list the faces:
1. Two equilateral triangles (the bases of the bipyramid).
2. Four isosceles triangles (the sides of the bipyramid).

The edge lengths \(3, 7, 8, 9, 11\) can be assigned to the edges of the polyhedron as follows:
- The two equilateral triangles have sides \(3, 7, 8\).
- The four isosceles triangles have sides \(3, 9, 11\), \(7, 9, 11\), \(8, 9, 11\), and \(8, 7, 11\).

This configuration satisfies the given edge lengths and forms a valid polyhedron.

"To solve the problem, we need to convert the given numbers from their respective bases to base 10 and then compare them. Let's start with the first part of the problem.

### Part 1: Convert \(7_8\) and \(8_9\) to base 10

1. **Convert \(7_8\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(7_8\) is a single digit in base 8, so its value in base 10 is simply 7.
   - Therefore, \(7_8 = 7_{10}\).

2. **Convert \(8_9\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(8_9\) is a single digit in base 9, so its value in base 10 is simply 8.
   - Therefore, \(8_9 = 8_{10}\).

3. **Compare \(7_{10}\) and \(8_{10}\):**
   - Clearly, \(7_{10} < 8_{10}\).
   - Therefore, \(7_8 < 8_9\).

     \[
     1 \cdot 3^2 = 9, \quad 2 \cdot 3^1 = 6, \quad 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1

   - Add the results:
     \[
     9 + 6 + 1 = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, \(121_3 = 16_{10}\).

2. **Convert \(413_5\) to base 10:**
   - The number \(413_5\) can be expanded as follows:
     \[
     413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0
     \]
   - Calculate each term:
     \[

First, let's write down the substitution:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we expand each term separately.

1. Expand \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

2. Expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

3. Expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

"To determine if the point \((6, 0)\) lies on the line given by the equation \(y = 2x - 2\), we need to substitute the coordinates of the point into the equation and check if the equation holds true.

Here are the steps:

1. Identify the coordinates of the point. The point is \((6, 0)\), so \(x = 6\) and \(y = 0\).
2. Substitute \(x = 6\) into the equation \(y = 2x - 2\).
3. Calculate the right-hand side of the equation.

Let's do this step by step:

1. Substitute \(x = 6\) into the equation:
   \[
   y = 2(6) - 2
   \]
2. Calculate the right-hand side:
   \[
   y = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]

Now, we compare the calculated value of \(y\) with the \(y\)-coordinate of the point. The calculated value of \(y\) is 10, but the \(y\)-coordinate of the point is 0. Since \(10 \neq 0\), the point \((6, 0)\) does not lie on the line \(y = 2x - 2\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots of the polynomial. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to express \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) in terms of these sums and products. Let's denote:
\[
a = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
b = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
c = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.
\]

We know that:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0,
\]
\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the squares of the roots:
\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = 4 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4.
\]

Now, we use the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0.
\]

We also use the identity for the product of the roots:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

Finally, we use the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We can now find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) by solving the system of equations:
\[
a + b + c = 0,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = 0,
\]
\[
abc = 2.

"To determine if the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{4}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Convert \(\frac{1}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 500.
2. Compare the two fractions.

First, let's convert \(\frac{1}{4}\) to a fraction with a denominator of 500. We do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by 125:
\[
\frac{1}{4} = \frac{1 \times 125}{4 \times 125} = \frac{125}{500}
\]

Now, we compare \(\frac{137}{500}\) and \(\frac{125}{500}\). Since the denominators are the same, we only need to compare the numerators. The numerator of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is 137, and the numerator of \(\frac{125}{500}\) is 125. Since 137 is greater than 125, we have:
\[
\frac{137}{500} > \frac{125}{500}
\]

Therefore, \(\frac{137}{500}\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{4}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum distance from the point \(O\) to the center of the rectangle \(ABCD\) given that \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\) and \(AB/AD = k\).

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a, -b)\), \(B = (a, -b)\), \(C = (a, b)\), and \(D = (-a, b)\). The length of \(AB\) is \(2a\) and the length of \(AD\) is \(2b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb.
\]

The coordinates of the center of the rectangle \(ABCD\) are the midpoint of the diagonals, which is:
\[
\left( \frac{-a + a}{2}, \frac{-b + b}{2} \right) = (0, 0).
\]

Since \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\), the coordinates of \(O\) are:
\[
O = \left( \frac{-a + a}{2}, \frac{-b + b}{2} \right) = (0, 0).
\]

However, this is incorrect because \(O\) is the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\), not the center of the rectangle. The correct coordinates of \(O\) are:
\[
O = \left( \frac{-a + a}{2}, \frac{-b + b}{2} \right) = (0, 0).
\]

The distance from \(O\) to the center of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(a - 0)^2 + (b - 0)^2} = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}.

Substituting \(a = kb\), we get:
\[

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f(n) \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the values of the three terms together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

- For the next 8 days, she can be in the hospital for 90 days.
- For the next 2 days, she can be in the hospital for 100 days.

So, the maximum number of days Fasalka can stay in the hospital is 270 days.

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[

And the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the first and third rows is the same, which is \( 2n + 1 \). Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first column:

\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1

Next, the sum of the numbers in the second column:

\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3n - 6

And the sum of the numbers in the third column:

\[

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the main diagonal is \( 4n - 13 \) and the sum of the numbers in the other diagonal is \( 3n - 6 \). For the grid to be a magic square, these sums must be equal. Therefore, we set up the equation:

"To solve the problem, we start by using the given information that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\). We expand this product:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.

Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we simplify the expression:

\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
