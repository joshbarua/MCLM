"To determine the length of \( DE \) in the given right triangle \( \triangle DEF \), we start by noting that \( \angle EDF = 90^\circ \) and \( \sin D = 0.7 \). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, the opposite side to \( \angle D \) is \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DF \). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]

We are given that the length of \( EF \) is 7. Let \( DF \) be the hypotenuse. Then we can write:

\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

To find \( DF \), we solve for \( DF \) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DF \) and then dividing by 0.7:

\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \( DF \) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. In \( \triangle DEF \), this gives:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \( DF = 10 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49 \implies DE^2 = 100 - 49 \implies DE^2 = 51 \implies DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counter-clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   The translated complex number \( z' \) is given by:
   \[
   z' = z - c = \left(2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i\right) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \).
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right) = \left( \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We now perform the multiplication:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + i - 3i - 3i^2 = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]
   So, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is \( 4 - 2i \).

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   The original position of \( c \) is \( 2 - 3i \), so we add \( c \) to \( z'' \):
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[
242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
\]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that three specific people (PIE, RO, TO) sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat PIE, RO, and TO as a single block**: Since PIE, RO, and TO must sit together, we can consider them as one ""super person"" or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 blocks (the PIO block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange PIO within their block**: Within the PIO block, the three people can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the order in which they sit matters.

4. **Combine the two results**: To get the total number of arrangements, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange PIO within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that PIO, RO, and TO sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is \(\boxed{-125}\).","[-125, '-125']",-125,"[-125, '-125']",True
"To find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression and then simplify modulo 7.

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8.
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of each individual term when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

First, find the remainder when 4 is divided by 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}.

Next, find the remainder when 6 is divided by 7:
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}.

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3.

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoint of the other diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\) must be the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

From the x-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

From the y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, there must be an error in the interpretation or the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7.

Given the correct interpretation, the correct x-coordinate should be:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

But since \(x > 7\), we need to re-evaluate the problem constraints or the problem itself. If the problem constraints are correct, then the correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7, which is not possible with the given vertices and the property of the diagonals bisecting each other.

Thus, the correct interpretation should be that the problem constraints are incorrect or the problem itself is incorrect. However, if we assume the problem constraints are correct, then the correct x-coordinate should be:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

But since \(x > 7\), the correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex is such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7, which is not possible with the given vertices and the property of the diagonals bisecting each other.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}

"To find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and the sum \(a + b + c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation \(x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\).
   We can factor the quadratic expression as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0 \implies x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \(f(x) = \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}\), where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials, depends on the degrees of the polynomials.
   - If the degree of \(P(x)\) is less than the degree of \(Q(x)\), the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\).
   - If the degree of \(P(x)\) is equal to the degree of \(Q(x)\), the horizontal asymptote is \(y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)}\).
   - If the degree of \(P(x)\) is greater than the degree of \(Q(x)\), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

   For the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), the degree of the numerator \(P(x) = 2x\) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \(Q(x) = x^2 - 5x - 14\) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). So, \(c = 0\).

3. **Find the sum \(a + b + c\):**
   Now that we have \(a = 7\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = 0\), we can find the sum:
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 1\) and \(\lambda_2 = 16\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

In this problem, the exponent \(2^{235423523}\) is a very large number, but it does not change the fundamental property of exponentiation with 1. Therefore, we can directly apply the property that \(1^a = 1\) for any real number \(a\).

"To solve the problem, we start with the given conditions: \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). This means that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as:

\[
(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.
\]

Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must satisfy the equation:

\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can subtract 1 from both sides to get:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[5 \cdot 9 = 45\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[45 + 8 = 53\]

So, \(58_9\) in base \(10\) is \(53\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]
\[8 \cdot 1 = 8\]

Adding these values together:
\[9 + 8 = 17\]

So, \(18_9\) in base \(10\) is \(17\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\)

Now, we subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53 - 17 = 36\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36\) back to base \(9\)

To convert \(36\) from base \(10\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ remainder } 0\]

So, \(36\) in base \(9\) is \(40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of the secant function. The secant of \(x\) is the reciprocal of the cosine of \(x\), so \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\).
2. Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\) in the expression.
3. Combine the fractions by finding a common denominator.
4. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the substitution:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\):

\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now the expression is:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Since the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them by subtracting the numerators:

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:

\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the original expression is:

\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one toy truck in terms of the weight of one quilt and one garter, and then use this relationship to find out how many toy trucks are equivalent in weight to one quilt.

First, let's denote the weights of the toy truck, quilt, and garter as follows:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of one toy truck.
- Let \( Q \) be the weight of one quilt.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of one garter.

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:
1. 10 toy trucks are equal in weight to 3 quilts and 1 garter. This can be written as:
   \[
   10T = 3Q + G
   \]
2. 2 toy trucks are equal in weight to 1 quilt and 1 garter. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T = Q + G
   \]

We now have a system of two equations:
1. \( 10T = 3Q + G \)
2. \( 2T = Q + G \)

To eliminate \( G \), we can subtract the second equation from the first:
\[
(10T - 2T) = (3Q + G) - (Q + G)
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
8T = 2Q
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
4T = Q
\]
or
\[
Q = 4T

This tells us that the weight of one quilt is equal to the weight of 4 toy trucks. Therefore, the number of toy trucks that are equivalent in weight to one quilt is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",3,"[3, '3']",False

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

"To determine the radius of the circular base of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which water is entering the tank and the rate at which the water level is rising.

First, let's denote the radius of the circular base of the tank by \( r \) meters. The volume \( V \) of water in the tank at any given time is the volume of a cylinder, which is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( h \) is the height of the water in the tank.

We are given that water is entering the tank at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour.

To find the relationship between the rate of change of volume and the rate of change of height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function piecewise and ensure that there are no gaps in the range of \(f(x)\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

First, let's consider the behavior of \(f(x)\) on each interval.

1. For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) on this interval occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
So, the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). The range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) depends on the sign of \(a\):
- If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing, and the range is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).
- If \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing, and the range is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) on both intervals must cover all real numbers. This means that the range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) must be a subset of the range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) or vice versa.

Let's consider the case \(a > 0\):
- The range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).
- The range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

For these ranges to cover all real numbers, we need:
\[ a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0. \]
The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq 2. \]
Since \(a > 0\), we have:
\[ a \geq 2. \]

Now, let's consider the case \(a < 0\):
- The range of \(f(x)\) on \([a, \infty)\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\).
- The range of \(f(x)\) on \((-\infty, a)\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

For these ranges to cover all real numbers, we need:
\[ a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]

The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq 2. \]
Since \(a < 0\), we have:
\[ a \leq -1. \]

"To find the value of \( c \) in the equation of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \( r \) is the radius of the circle, and \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle.

Given that the radius \( r \) is 1, the standard form of the equation becomes \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = 1\).

Let's start by completing the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the given equation.

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
   \]

2. Move the constant term \( c \) to the other side of the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y = -c
   \]

3. Complete the square for the \( x \)-terms. To do this, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). Add and subtract this square inside the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + y^2 + 6y = -c
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25 + y^2 + 6y = -c
   \]

4. Complete the square for the \( y \)-terms. To do this, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). Add and subtract this square inside the equation:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25 + y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = -c
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 = -c
   \]

5. Combine the constant terms on the left side:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 = -c
   \]

6. Move the constant term \(-34\) to the other side of the equation:
   \[
   (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c
   \]

Now, the equation is in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((h, k) = (5, -3)\) and the radius \( r = \sqrt{34 - c} \). Since we know the radius is 1, we can set up the equation:
\[
\sqrt{34 - c} = 1
\]

7. Square both sides to solve for \( c \):
   \[
   34 - c = 1
   \]

8. Subtract 34 from both sides:
   \[
   -c = 1 - 34

   Simplify the right side:
   \[
   -c = -33

"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
Since \(\lambda \ge 0\), the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \ge 0\) is satisfied if \(\lambda \ge 1\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1\) is always true for \(\lambda \ge 0\). Therefore, the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let \(x_0\) be such an \(x\). Then \(f(x_0) \neq x_0\) and \(f(f(x_0)) = x_0\). Let \(y_0 = f(x_0)\). Then \(f(y_0) = x_0\) and \(y_0 \neq x_0\).

Since \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we have:
\[
y_0 = \lambda x_0 (1 - x_0) \quad \text{and} \quad x_0 = \lambda y_0 (1 - y_0).
\]
Substituting \(y_0\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x_0 = \lambda (\lambda x_0 (1 - x_0))(1 - \lambda x_0 (1 - x_0)) = \lambda^2 x_0 (1 - x_0)(1 - \lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0^2).
\]
Since \(x_0 \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x_0\):
\[
1 = \lambda^2 (1 - x_0)(1 - \lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x_0 + \lambda x_0^2 - x_0 + \lambda x_0^2 - \lambda^2 x_0^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x_0 + \lambda (2x_0^2 - \lambda x_0^3)).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x_0 + \lambda^3 (2x_0^2 - \lambda x_0^3).
\]
Since \(x_0 = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we substitute \(x_0\) into the equation:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^3 \left(2 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3\right).
\]
Simplifying the terms, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 - (\lambda + 1)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^3 \left(2 \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3}\right) = \lambda^2 - (\lambda^2 - 1) + \lambda^3 \left(2 \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^2}\right).
\]
\[
1 = 1 + \lambda^3 \left(\frac{2(\lambda - 1)^2 - (\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^2}\right) = 1 + \lambda^3 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^2 (2 - (\lambda - 1))}{\lambda^2}\right) = 1 + \lambda^3 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^2 (3 - \lambda)}{\lambda^2}\right).

\[
1 = 1 + \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2 (3 - \lambda)}{\lambda}.

Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:

0 = \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2 (3 - \lambda)}{\lambda}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) to rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin \left( \frac{A+B}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{A-B}{2} \right)\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 5^\circ}{-2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 5^\circ} = -\frac{\cos 5^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ} = -\cot 5^\circ = -\tan 85^\circ.
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = 85^\circ\).

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product of the first 42 positive integers. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is equal to the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We can find the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) by summing the integer divisions of 42 by all powers of 5:

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

Next, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{625} \right\rfloor\) and all higher terms will also be zero, we can stop here. Summing these values gives:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) within the range \(-1 \le x \le 1\) and \(y \le 1\), we will analyze the function and use some trigonometric substitutions to simplify the problem.

First, let's use the trigonometric substitutions:
\[ x = \sin \theta \quad \text{and} \quad y = \sin \phi \]
where \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2}\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} \le \phi \le \frac{\pi}{2}\). This substitution ensures that \(x\) and \(y\) are within the range \([-1, 1]\).

Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\sin \theta, \sin \phi) = \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \phi} + \sin \phi \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \cos \phi + \sin \phi \cos \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi) \]

The function \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) achieves its maximum value of 1 when \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} + 2k\pi\) for any integer \(k\). Since \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) are in the range \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\), the maximum value of \(\theta + \phi\) is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(\sin(\theta + \phi)\) is 1.

The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

\[

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, i.e., \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, \( \frac{1}{z} = \overline{z} \), the complex conjugate of \( z \). The given equation can be rewritten as:

\[ z + \overline{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This implies that the real part of \( z \) is \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). Let \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then \( \overline{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Next, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{85i\theta} + e^{-85i\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio, and it is known that \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \) (since \( \cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) and \( \cos\left(\frac{4\pi}{5}\right) = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{4} \)). However, the value of \( \cos(85\theta) \) will be the same for both \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \) and \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \) due to the periodicity and symmetry of the cosine function.

For \( \theta = \frac{2\pi}{5} \),

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{2\pi}{5} = 34\pi, \]

and

\[ \cos(34\pi) = \cos(0) = 1. \]

For \( \theta = \frac{4\pi}{5} \),

\[ 85\theta = 85 \cdot \frac{4\pi}{5} = 68\pi, \]

and

\[ \cos(68\pi) = \cos(0) = 1. \]

Therefore, in both cases, \( \cos(85\theta) = 1 \), and

"To find the area of triangle \(MGN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments into which the centroid divides the median. In this case, the ratio is \(AG:AD = 2:3\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = \frac{576}{9} = 64

Thus, the area of triangle \(MGN\) is:

- \(a_1\) is the first term,

We are given two pieces of information:

2. The 8th term \(a_8 = 500\).

Using the general formula, we can write the following equations based on the given information:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

To find the common difference \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[

Since the left side of the equation is a power of 2, \( k \) must also be a power of 2. Let \( k = 2^m \) for some non-negative integer \( m \). Substituting \( k = 2^m \) into the equation, we get:

From the problem, we know two things:

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:

2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \) (since each 10-segment coin is worth 10 segments and each 5-segment coin is worth 5 segments)

The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, only one number is even (2), and the rest are odd (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

Pool and Jeness each select one of these six prime numbers randomly. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Therefore, we need to consider the following two scenarios:

2. Both Poool and Jeness select the even number.

First, let's calculate the probability of each scenario.

**Scenario 1: Both Poool and Jeness select odd numbers.**

There are 5 odd numbers out of the 6 prime numbers. The probability that Poool selects an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\), and the probability that Jeness selects an odd number is also \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Poool and Jeness select odd numbers is:

"To determine the total area of the regions where the grid lines intersect (the ""filling"" parts), we need to analyze the given figure and count the number of intersection points.

First, let's identify the grid lines and their intersections:
- There are 3 vertical grid lines (from \(x=0\) to \(x=3\)).
- There are 4 horizontal grid lines (from \(y=0\) to \(y=3\)).

The intersection points of these grid lines form a grid of smaller squares. Each intersection point is the intersection of one vertical line and one horizontal line. Since there are 3 vertical lines and 4 horizontal lines, the number of intersection points is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12
\]

Each intersection point is a vertex of a small square, and each small square has an area of \(1 \times 1 = 1\). Therefore, the total area of the regions where the grid lines intersect is the number of intersection points, which is 12.

Thus, the total area of the filling parts is:
\[
\boxed{12}

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all digits are either 0 or 1, we start by noting that 450 can be factored as \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25\). Therefore, any multiple of 450 must be even and end in 00, 50, or 75. Since the digits must be either 0 or 1, the only possible last two digits of the multiple of 450 are 00.

We now need to find the smallest number of the form \(111\ldots1100\) that is divisible by 450. This number can be written as \(111\ldots1100 = 111\ldots11 \times 100\), where \(111\ldots11\) is a number consisting of \(k\) ones. Let \(N = \frac{10^k - 1}{9}\). Then we need \(450 \times N\) to be a number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1. This simplifies to \(2 \times 50 \times N = 100 \times N\), so \(N\) must be a number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1.

We need to find the smallest \(k\) such that \(N = \frac{10^k - 1}{9}\) is divisible by 50. Since \(10^k - 1\) must be divisible by 450, we need \(10^k \equiv 1 \pmod{50}\). We check the powers of 10 modulo 50:

"To determine the probability that Cheever places his checker on the shaded square in a checkerboard, we need to analyze the process step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - The first digit is the remainder when the number of hits is divided by 4. This can be any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3.
   - The second digit is the remainder when the number of hits is divided by 5. This can be any of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 5 = 20\).

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The shaded square is the intersection of the row and column corresponding to the remainders 1 and 2, respectively. This means that the first digit must be 1 and the second digit must be 2.
   - There is only one combination that satisfies this condition, which is (1, 2).

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{1}{20}\).

"To determine the sum of the digits of the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to a decimal.

First, note that \(5^7 = 78125\) and \(2^8 = 256\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{78125 \cdot 256}
\]

Next, we calculate the denominator:
\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 20000000
\]

So the fraction simplifies to:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}

To convert this fraction to a decimal, we perform the division:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

The finite decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of this decimal number. The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:
\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,

\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), but a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:

Simplifying this equation, we get:

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we start by analyzing the function \( f(x) \) and its roots. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The function \( g(x) \) is obtained by shifting the graph of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units. Shifting a function \( f(x) \) to the left by \( c \) units results in the function \( f(x+c) \). Therefore, \( g(x) = f(x+5) \).

The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r-5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). Applying this identity, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.

Thus, the original expression becomes:
\[

\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We will use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\) and some trigonometric properties. Let's denote \(a = \tan 10^\circ\), \(b = \tan 20^\circ\), and \(c = \tan 40^\circ\). Then, \(\cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{a}\), \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{b}\), and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{c}\). We need to find:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = a^2 + \frac{1}{b^2} + \frac{1}{c^2}.
\]

Using the tangent addition formula and properties of tangents, we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ}{1 - (\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ + \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ)} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]
This implies:
\[
\tan 10^\circ + \tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ - \tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use known values and properties of tangents and cotangents. It is known that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.

Therefore, the original expression becomes:
\[

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of the interior angles, excluding one angle, is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Express the sum of the interior angles excluding one angle:**
   If we exclude one angle, the sum of the remaining angles is:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one angle)}
   \]
   We know this sum is \(1070^\circ\), so we can write:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one angle)} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Determine the range for the excluded angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the excluded angle must be greater than \(0^\circ\) and less than \(180^\circ\).

4. **Find the possible values for \(n\):**
   We need to find \(n\) such that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{(one angle)} < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Since the excluded angle is less than \(180^\circ\), we can approximate:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 180^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying the left inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-3) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Solving for \(n\):
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-3
   \]
   \[
   5.9444 < n-3
   \]
   \[
   8.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 9
   \]

   Simplifying the right inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 180^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   This inequality is always true for any \(n\).

5. **Verify the solution:**
   We need to check if \(n = 9\) satisfies the original condition. If \(n = 9\), the total sum of the interior angles is:
   \[
   (9-2) \times 180^\circ = 7 \times 180^\circ = 1260^\circ
   \]
   The sum of the remaining angles is:
   \[
   1260^\circ - \text{(one angle)} = 1070^\circ
   \]
   Therefore, the excluded angle is:
   \[
   1260^\circ - 1070^\circ = 190^\circ
   \]
   Since \(190^\circ\) is less than \(180^\circ\), it is a valid angle for a convex polygon.

Thus, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",8,"[8, '8']",False
"To find the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by understanding the condition given. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:

\[ t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

According to the problem, \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \), so we have:

\[ t \cdot (t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left side, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. To do this, we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x = -x \) modulo 23):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for odd integer solutions, both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are valid. However, the problem asks for the odd integer solution, and both are odd, so we can choose either. The problem does not specify which one to choose, so we can choose the smaller one.

Thus, the odd integer solution is:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the length of one side of the cube.
2. Calculate the surface area of the cube using the side length.

**Step 1: Determine the length of one side of the cube.**

The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \(s\) is the length of one side of the cube. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we have:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]

The surface area \(A\) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = 6s^2 \]
where \(s\) is the length of one side of the cube. Since \(s = 1\) foot, we have:
\[ A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

"To find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Calculating the squares, we have:

\[

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

\[a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2\]

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we need to evaluate \( g(6) \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function \( g(x) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by analyzing the expression inside the sine function. Let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\) and \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Since \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{1}{\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}\), we need to find \(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). If \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\), then \(\frac{1}{x} = \tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right)\), so \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\).

Substituting these into the original equation, we get:
\[
\sin \left( \theta + \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1.
\]
However, we are given that \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which means there must be a different interpretation or a different approach to the problem.

Let's consider the general identity for the sum of arctangents and arccotangents. For \(x > 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
For \(x < 0\), we have:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}(x) = -\frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
However, \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\), so:
\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}(x) + \left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]
This means that:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1.
\]
But we are given that \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no real solutions to the equation.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:
\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
we first need to verify that the direction vectors are parallel. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Notice that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), so the direction vectors are indeed parallel.

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:
\[
D = \frac{\| \mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|}
\]
where \(\mathbf{P}_1\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines. We can use \(\mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{P}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) as the points on the first and second lines, respectively. The direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\) is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \((\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d}\):
\[
(\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| (\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\mathbf{d}\):
\[
\| \mathbf{d} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(D\):
\[
D = \frac{\| (\mathbf{P}_2 - \mathbf{P}_1) \times \mathbf{d} \|}{\| \mathbf{d} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To determine how many integer coordinate points lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the region where the \(x\)-coordinates and \(y\)-coordinates of the points satisfy the inequalities:

This means that \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\) (inclusive), and \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\) (inclusive).

First, let's count the number of possible values for \(x\). The integers from \(-4\) to \(4\) are:

"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we get

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

Combining these results, we have

\[

Substituting these values into the expression, we get

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[
-2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Adding these vectors together, we get

- The price of a Brazil stamp in the 70s is 12 seurs.
- The price of a France stamp in the 70s is 12 seurs.
- The price of a Peru stamp in the 70s is 15 seurs.
- The price of a Spain stamp in the 70s is 9 seurs.

Next, we calculate the total price for each country:
- Brazil: \(5 \text{ stamps} \times 12 \text{ seurs/stamp} = 60 \text{ seurs}\)
- France: \(8 \text{ stamps} \times 12 \text{ seurs/stamp} = 96 \text{ seurs}\)
- Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 15 \text{ seurs/stamp} = 90 \text{ seurs}\)
- Spain: \(3 \text{ stamps} \times 9 \text{ seurs/stamp} = 27 \text{ seurs}\)

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid from \(BC\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} (a + b) h = 42.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as one of the legs. Let \(AC = c\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot CD.

Next, we need to find the relationship between \(c\), \(CD\), \(a\), and \(b\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

\]

However, we can also use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\) when considering \(CD\) as the base. Therefore, \(CD\) is the projection of \(AC\) onto \(BC\), and we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
CD = \sqrt{c^2 - h^2}.
\]

But we don't need to find \(CD\) explicitly to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Instead, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a part of the area of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and it is also a leg of the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot c \cdot \sqrt{c^2 - h^2}.

However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a fraction of the area of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21.

"To find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\), we use the definition of the operation \( @ \), which is given by:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \( \frac{21}{30} \). The greatest common divisor of \( 21 \) and \( 30 \) is \( 3 \), so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by \( 3 \):

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now, we substitute \( \frac{7}{10} \) back into the expression:

\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

To simplify this, we multiply \( 70 \) by \( \frac{7}{10} \):

\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = \frac{70 \times 7}{10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are randomly and independently selected on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of ways to choose the points:**
   There are \(4!\) (24) ways to assign the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) to the vertices of a quadrilateral. However, since the order in which we choose the points does not matter, we only need to consider the distinct quadrilaterals, which is given by the number of ways to choose 4 points out of 4, which is 1.

2. **Determine the number of ways the line segments intersect:**
   For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle in one direction, the points must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

   There are 2 such arrangements out of the 24 possible permutations of the points. This is because for any given arrangement of the points, there is exactly one way to pair them such that the line segments intersect.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the given configuration of two circles with centers \(D\), radii 1 and 2, and the total area of the shaded region being \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle and the area of the sector of the larger circle that is not part of the shaded region. The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
So, the area of the sector of the larger circle that is part of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = 4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]

The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees and \(r\) is the radius of the circle. For the larger circle, the radius \(r = 2\), so:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi
\]
We know this area is equal to the area of the sector of the larger circle that is part of the shaded region:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
To find \(\theta\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4 = \frac{5}{3}
\]
\[
\theta \times 4 = \frac{5}{3} \times 360^\circ
\]
\[
\theta \times 4 = 600^\circ
\]
\[
\theta = \frac{600^\circ}{4} = 150^\circ
\]

Thus, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{150}\).","[150, '150']",120,"[120, '120']",False
"To determine how many circular cylindrical buckets are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical buckets and the spherical tank, and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the volume of one bucket.

First, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (216) = 288 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical bucket. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For one cylindrical bucket, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi (9) (8) = 72 \pi \, \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical buckets are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical bucket:
\[ \text{Number of buckets} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{72 \pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical buckets needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will proceed step by step.

First, let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). This means that \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (A + B)\) and \(\sin (B - A)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A
\]

First, we need to find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\). Since \(\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
Similarly,
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we can substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Now we need to find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We can simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member committee from a group of 14 members (8 Republicans and 6 Democrats) with the condition that the committee must include at least one member from each party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee from 14 members:**
   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5!9!} = 2002

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member committee that consists entirely of Republicans:**

5. **Re-evaluate the problem:**

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 16^3
\]

Next, we calculate \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So the equation becomes:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

We can simplify the left side of the equation by recognizing that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial. It can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root introduces both a positive and a negative solution:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm 64
\]

This gives us two possible equations to solve:

1. \(x - 2 = 64\)
2. \(x - 2 = -64\)

Solving the first equation:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66
\]

Solving the second equation:

\[
x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation is:

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by using the property of the cosine function that \(\cos(\pi + x) = -\cos(x)\). Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

The expression then becomes:
\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines:
\[
\cos x \cos 2x \cos 4x \cos 8x = \frac{\sin 16x}{16 \sin x}.
\]
Here, \(x = \frac{\pi}{15}\), so \(16x = \frac{16\pi}{15}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]
Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \sin \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:
\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = -\frac{1}{16}.

Thus, the original expression is:

"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the triangle. We know that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \). Point \( D \) lies on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then, \( BC = 2x \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \), we get:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies AB^2 = 11^2 + x^2 \implies AB^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we also have \( AC^2 = 121 + x^2 \).

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), the sum of the angles is \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle DBC + \angle BCD + \angle BDC = 180^\circ \implies \angle DBC + \angle BCD + 3\theta = 180^\circ.
\]
Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), we have \( \angle DBC = \angle DBC = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \).

Now, we use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle DBC}.
\]
Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BCD = \angle DBC = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}}.
\]
Since \( BD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \), we get:
\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}}.
\]
Using the identity \( \sin \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} = \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{1}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}.
\]
Using the identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \) and \( \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 3\theta}{2}} \), we can solve for \( x \) in terms of \( \theta \).

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BAC = 30^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \). Therefore, \( \triangle BDC \) is a right triangle with \( \angle BDC = 90^\circ \). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle BDC \), we get:
\[
BD^2 + CD^2 = BC^2 \implies 1^2 + x^2 = (2x)^2 \implies 1 + x^2 = 4x^2 \implies 1 = 3x^2 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{3} \implies x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{3}.
\]
Therefore, \( BC = 2x = \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \), we get:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + x^2 = 121 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{364}{3} \implies AB = \sqrt{\frac{364}{3}} = \frac{2\sqrt{273}}{3}.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have \( AC = \frac{2\sqrt{273}}{3} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \frac{2\sqrt{273}}{3} + \frac{2\sqrt{273}}{3} + \frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3} = \frac{4\sqrt{273} + 2\sqrt{3}}{3}.

"To find the central value of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by determining the sum of these integers. The sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} (2a + n - 1)
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum \(S\) is:

\[
S = \frac{27}{2} (2a + 26) = 27 (a + 13)
\]

We know that this sum is equal to \(3^7\). Therefore, we have:

\[
27 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:

\[
3^3 (a + 13) = 3^7
\]

Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81

Solving for \(a\), we find:

\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

First, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is also non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real \(x\).

Next, let's consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We can factor this quadratic equation as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) cannot be negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(y = 3\), which means \(x^2 = 3\). So, the solutions to the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\) are \(x = \sqrt{3}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between its roots. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Combining the solutions of the two inequalities, we get that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, we use the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the known values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy+yz+zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right).
\]

Now, we use another identity for the sum of products of the variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)\left((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)\right)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy+yz+zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,

\[
s = 4.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0
\]

### Step 1: Factor the denominator
The denominator \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)
\]

### Step 2: Identify the critical points
The critical points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. These points are:
- \(x^2 - 81 = 0 \implies x = \pm 9\)
- \(x(x - 36) = 0 \implies x = 0\) or \(x = 36\)

So, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

### Step 3: Determine the sign of the expression in each interval
We need to test the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

#### Interval \((-\infty, -9)\)
Choose \(x = -10\):
\[

The expression is positive in this interval.

#### Interval \((-9, 0)\)
Choose \(x = -1\):
\[
\frac{|(-1)^2 - 81|}{(-1)(-1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(-1)(-37)} = \frac{80}{37} > 0
\]
The expression is positive in this interval.

#### Interval \((0, 9)\)
Choose \(x = 1\):
\[
\frac{|1^2 - 81|}{(1)(1 - 36)} = \frac{|1 - 81|}{(1)(-35)} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0
\]
The expression is negative in this interval.

#### Interval \((9, 36)\)
Choose \(x = 10\):
\[
\frac{|10^2 - 81|}{(10)(10 - 36)} = \frac{|100 - 81|}{(10)(-26)} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0

The expression is negative in this interval.

#### Interval \((36, \infty)\)
Choose \(x = 37\):
\[
\frac{|37^2 - 81|}{(37)(37 - 36)} = \frac{|1369 - 81|}{(37)(1)} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0

### Step 4: Consider the critical points
The expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At \(x = -9\) and \(x = 9\), the numerator is zero, so the expression is zero, which does not satisfy the inequality.

### Step 5: Combine the results
The expression is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the area of the football field that maximizes the area given the perimeter constraint, we need to consider the shape of the field, which consists of a rectangle with two semicircles on the ends. Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The width \( W \) is also the diameter of the semicircles.

The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. Since the circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi W/2 \), the total perimeter is:
\[
2L + 2 \left( \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) = 2L + \pi W
\]
We are given that the perimeter is 400 meters, so we have:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \) and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \), so the total area is:
\[
A = L W + 2 \left( \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \right) = L W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4}

\]
To maximize the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0

Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
200 = \frac{\pi W}{2} \implies W = \frac{400}{\pi}

Substituting \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 400}{2} = 0

This result indicates that the length \( L \) is 0, which is not possible for a field. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the correct perimeter formula and solve it again.

The correct perimeter formula should be:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:

The area \( A \) of the field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \) and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \), so the total area is:
\[
A = L W + 2 \left( \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \right) = L W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4}
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \frac{400W}{2} - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{4}
\]
To maximize the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0

Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[

   - In a right triangle, the sum of the angles is \(180^\circ\). Since \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we have \(\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle T\) is the complement of \(\angle R\).
   - The sine of an angle is equal to the cosine of its complement. Thus, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

3. **Find \(\cos{R}\):**
   - The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, \(\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\), we have \(\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

"To find the minimum distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the graph \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance between a point \((x, y)\) on the graph and the origin. The distance \(D\) is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

Since \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we substitute this into the distance formula:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Next, we simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \(D\), we minimize the expression inside the square root, which is a function of \(x\):

\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

We find the critical points by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]

Setting \(f'(x) = 0\), we get:

\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the solutions:

\[ x = 0, \quad x = \sqrt{2}, \quad x = -\sqrt{2} \]

We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\), which occurs at \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). The corresponding \(y\)-coordinates are:

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Thus, the points on the graph closest to the origin are \((\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2})\). The distance from the origin to either of these points is:

\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

We express this distance in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), where \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Since \(a = 10\) is 1 more than the square of the integer 3, we have \(a = 10\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b = 10 + 2 = 12\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = 3 \), and \( x = -1 \). Since we are considering \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple rational solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this interval.

Therefore, the only solution is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron.

Let's denote the vertices as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) where \( A \) is opposite to \( B \), \( C \) is opposite to \( D \), and \( E \) is opposite to \( F \).

Given the distances from \( P \) to the first five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance to the sixth vertex. Since the octahedron is regular, the distances from \( P \) to the opposite vertices must be equal. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex must be the same as the distance from \( P \) to the vertex opposite to the fifth vertex.

Let's assume without loss of generality that the distances are as follows:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)

Since \( A \) is opposite to \( B \), \( C \) is opposite to \( D \), and \( E \) is opposite to \( F \), the distance from \( P \) to \( F \) must be the same as the distance from \( P \) to \( E \), which is 11.

"To determine the ratio of the accelerations of the soft ball and the baseball, we start by using the formula for force, which is given by:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since the force applied by Jenna to the soft ball is the same as the force applied by the baseball, we can write:

\[ F_{\text{Jenna}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using the force formula for both the soft ball and the baseball, we get:

\[ m_{\text{Jenna}} \cdot a_{\text{Jenna}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We know the masses of the soft ball and the baseball:
\[ m_{\text{Jenna}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these masses into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{Jenna}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the accelerations, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{Jenna}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jenna}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150}{200} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine how many digits are the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7
We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the base 7 and base 8 representations
The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We now compare the digits in the same positions:

2. **计算直線的法线斜率**：法线与直線正交，因此法线的斜率 \(m_{\perp}\) 是 \(-\frac{1}{m} = -\frac{1}{2}\)。

3. **确定法线方程**：法线通过点 \((6, 0)\)。使用点-斜式方程 \(y - y_1 = m_{\perp}(x - x_1)\)：

   这可以化为：

Since the sides of the smaller rectangle are half the length of the sides of \(ABCD\), the area of the smaller rectangle is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of \(ABCD\).

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\).","[1/4, '\\frac{1}{4}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division: \(54 \div 6\).
2. Determine the quotient: \(54 \div 6 = 9\).
3. Multiply the quotient by 6 to find the product: \(9 \times 6 = 54\).
4. Subtract the product from 54 to find the remainder: \(54 - 54 = 0\).

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each term separately using the definition of the function \( f \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \times 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function, which is \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we can add the results of the three evaluations together:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money was left after converting the collected coins into dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected from each person.
2. Sum these amounts to get the total amount collected.
3. Convert the total amount collected into dollars.
4. Determine the amount of money left after converting.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected from each person:
-リンダ: \$27.47
-シェries: \$35.23
- Juane: \$37.37
- Cooney: \$26.52

Next, we sum these amounts:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount collected is \$126.59.

Since the problem does not specify the value of the coins in cents, we assume that the total amount collected is already in dollars. Therefore, the amount of money left after converting is:

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 80 points:
   \[
   20 \text{ students} \times 80 \text{ points/student} = 1600 \text{ points}
   \]

2. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 90 points:
   \[
   8 \text{ students} \times 90 \text{ points/student} = 720 \text{ points}
   \]

3. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 100 points:
   \[
   2 \text{ students} \times 100 \text{ points/student} = 200 \text{ points}
   \]

4. Add up all the total scores to get the overall total score for the class:
   \[
   1600 \text{ points} + 720 \text{ points} + 200 \text{ points} = 2520 \text{ points}
   \]

5. Divide the overall total score by the number of students to get the average score:
   \[
   \frac{2520 \text{ points}}{30 \text{ students}} = 84 \text{ points}
   \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for the given magic square, we need to verify that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. The given magic square is:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 & n+2 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 & 2 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 & 3 \\
\hline
1 & n-1 & 2 & n \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = n-3 + 3 + n + 1 + n + 2 = 3n + 3
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 + 2 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 + 2 = 3n - 4
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the two sums equal to each other:
\[
3n + 3 = 3n - 4
\]

Subtracting \( 3n \) from both sides, we get:
\[
3 = -4
\]

This equation is clearly false, which means there must be a mistake in the interpretation or the problem setup. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the possibility that the magic square might have a different structure or the values might be different. However, the problem states that the sums are equal, so we need to recheck the problem constraints or the provided values.

Given the problem constraints and the provided values, the correct interpretation is that the magic square is indeed a 4x4 magic square, and the sum of each row, column, and diagonal must be the same. The correct value of \( n \) that satisfies the magic square properties is:

"To determine how much fartherジム歩aks compared toマーサ, we need to calculate the distance each person travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance thatジム travels. Sinceジム walks along the diagonal of the rectangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the length and the width of the rectangle).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2}
\]
Substituting the given values for the length and the width:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, the distance thatジム travels is 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance thatマーサ travels. Sinceマーサ walks along the length and the width of the rectangle, the total distance he travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Distance}_{\text{ma}} = \text{length} + \text{width} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]
So, the distance thatマーサ travels is 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference between the distances traveled byマーサ andジム:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Distance}_{\text{ma}} - \text{Distance}_{\text{ジ}} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore,ジム歩aks \(\boxed{200}\) feet less thanマーサ.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), we start by using the property that \(\omega^3 = 1\). This implies that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), or equivalently, \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

First, we find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega^2 + \omega\) with \(-1\):
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Next, we expand the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the value is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled by visiting each of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to consider all possible permutations of the points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The points are given with the following distances:
- \(AB = 6\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 5\)
- \(BD = 4\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will evaluate the distances for the following permutations:
1. \(D \to B \to C \to A\)
2. \(D \to B \to A \to C\)
3. \(D \to C \to B \to A\)
4. \(D \to C \to A \to B\)
5. \(D \to A \to B \to C\)
6. \(D \to A \to C \to B\)

Let's calculate the distance for each permutation:

1. \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

2. \(D \to B \to A \to C\):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
   \]

3. \(D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

4. \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16

5. \(D \to A \to B \to C\):

   \]

6. \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

From the above calculations, the shortest distance is 15, which corresponds to the permutations \(D \to B \to C \to A\) and \(D \to C \to B \to A\).

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled by visiting each of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",13,"[13, '13']",False
