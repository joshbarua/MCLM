"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) where \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the definition of sine in a right triangle:**
   The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this case, \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

2. **Given values:**
   We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
   \]
   Substituting the given value of \(EF\):
   \[
   \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
   \]

3. **Solve for \(DF\):**
   To find \(DF\), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then divide by 0.7:
   \[
   7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(DE\):**
   In a right triangle, the Pythagorean theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, \(DF\) is the hypotenuse, \(EF\) is one leg, and \(DE\) is the other leg. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values of \(DF\) and \(EF\):
   \[
   10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
   \]

5. **Solve for \(DE^2\):**
   To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
   \]

6. **Solve for \(DE\):**
   To find \(DE\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation:
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{51}
   \]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( z \) is obtained by rotating \( w \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can use the rotation formula for complex numbers. The rotation of a complex number \( w \) around another complex number \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[ z = c + (w - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), \( c = 2 - 3i \), and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). The complex number \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) is \( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Substituting these values into the rotation formula, we get:

\[ z = c + (w - c) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

First, we isolate \( w - c \):

\[ z - c = (w - c) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

\[ w - c = \frac{z - c}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}} \]

Next, we simplify the right-hand side by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of the denominator:

\[ w - c = \frac{(z - c) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)}{\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)} \]

The denominator simplifies to:

\[ \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 - \left( i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} = 1 \]

So, we have:

\[ w - c = (z - c) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

Now, we calculate \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = \left( 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \right) - \left( 2 - 3i \right) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i + 3i = \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \]

Next, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):

\[ w - c = \left( \sqrt{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We expand this product:

\[ w - c = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

\[ w - c = 1 - i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2}i + \frac{(3 - 3\sqrt{2})\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

\[ w - c = 1 - i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2}i + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \]

\[ w - c = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} - 1 \right)i \]

\[ w - c = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6 - 2}{2} \right)i \]

\[ w - c = 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2} \right)i \]

\[ w = c + 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2} \right)i \]

\[ w = 2 - 3i + 1 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2} \right)i \]

\[ w = 3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8}{2} - 3 \right)i \]

\[ w = 3 + \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} + \left( \frac{3\sqrt{2} - 8 - 6}{2} \right)i \]

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, 242 is divisible by 2, and we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]

2. Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. Check if it is divisible by 3:
   The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.

3. Check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Check if 121 is divisible by 7. Perform the division:
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857
   \]
   Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7.

5. Check if 121 is divisible by 11:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, 121 is divisible by 11, and we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]

6. Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) by taking the square root of the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine if the 8 players can form 4 teams of 2 players each, we need to check if the number of players is divisible by 2. Since 8 is divisible by 2, it is possible to form 4 teams of 2 players each.

Here is a step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the number of players: There are 8 players.
2. Check if the number of players is divisible by 2: \(8 \div 2 = 4\). Since the result is an integer, 8 is divisible by 2.
3. Form the teams: We can pair the players as follows:

   - Team 2: Player 3 and Player 4
   - Team 3: Player 5 and Player 6

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

So, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]
\[
10^2 = 100
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

So, the term is:

\[
10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -\frac{1000}{8} = -125

"To determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\).
2. Simplify the expression modulo 7.

Let's start with the substitution:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[

\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \(4 \cdot 6\):
\[

Finally, we find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

\[

"To find the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((x, y)\) in the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we first need to determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\).

The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
This midpoint is also the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the midpoint:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]
By equating the x-coordinates and y-coordinates, we get:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]
Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]
Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]
Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((6, -1)\). Since \(x > 7\), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation is that the point \((x, y)\) is not the fourth vertex but one of the other vertices. Let's consider the other possible vertices by re-evaluating the midpoint condition.

The correct approach is to consider the correct vertex \((x, y)\) that satisfies the condition \(x > 7\). The correct vertex is \((x, y) = (8, 1)\) because it satisfies the condition and the midpoint condition:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + 8}{2}, \frac{8 + 1}{2} \right) = \left( 7, \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]
Thus, the correct value of \(x + y\) is:

2. Substitute the given relationship \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\) into the tangent definition:

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and their respective values.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at those points. First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the denominator is zero when \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \). We need to check if the numerator is zero at these points:
\[ \text{At } x = 7, \quad 2(7) = 14 \neq 0. \]
\[ \text{At } x = -2, \quad 2(-2) = -4 \neq 0. \]
Since the numerator is not zero at \( x = 7 \) or \( x = -2 \), the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \), where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials of degrees \( n \) and \( m \) respectively, depends on the values of \( n \) and \( m \):
- If \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
- If \( n = m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } P(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } Q(x)} \).
- If \( n > m \), there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

For the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator \( n \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( m \) is 2. Since \( n < m \), the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now that we have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \), we can find \( a + b + c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can break down the problem into smaller, more manageable steps.

First, let's calculate \(99^2\):
\[

To make the multiplication easier, we can use the distributive property:

So, \(99^2 = 9801\).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16)

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(\frac{1}{z} = z^4\) and \(\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.\]

This is the sum of four of the fifth roots of unity, excluding 1. The fifth roots of unity are the roots of the polynomial \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:
\[(z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0.\]
Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:
\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\]

\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0\]

Calculating each term:

Calculating each term:
\[1 \cdot 9 = 9\]

\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Substitute \(\sec x\) with \(\frac{1}{\cos x}\):
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

This can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now that the fractions have the same denominator, we can combine them:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

The expression \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the definition of the cotangent function, so we can write:
\[
\cot x.
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of the given expression is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine if the combined weight of two trees and a bush is equal to the weight of one tree and one bush. Let's denote the weight of a tree as \( T \) and the weight of a bush as \( B \).

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Two trees and a bush weigh the same as one tree and one bush:
   \[
   2T + B = T + B
   \]
2. Simplifying the equation, we get:
   \[
   2T + B - B = T + B - B
   \]
   \[
   2T = T
   \]
   \[
   T = 0
   \]
   This means that the weight of a tree is zero.

Now, we need to check if the combined weight of two trees and a bush is equal to the weight of one tree and one bush:
\[
2T + B = T + B
\]
Since \( T = 0 \), we substitute \( T \) with 0:
\[
2(0) + B = 0 + B
\]
\[
B = B
\]
This equation is true, so the combined weight of two trees and a bush is indeed equal to the weight of one tree and one bush.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and then compare the coefficients of corresponding terms.

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will distribute each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:
\[
= 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:
\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the coefficients of the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

By comparing the coefficients of corresponding terms, we get the following system of equations:
1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 4:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 1:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 2:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This equation is satisfied.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into equation 3:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

This equation is also satisfied.

Since all the equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the sum \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the spherical ball that is the core of the torus, we need to analyze the given information and use the properties of the torus.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The volume of the torus is \(20\pi\) cubic meters.
   - The torus is rolling without slipping, and the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the ball is 2 meters.
   - The ball is rolling without slipping, and the distance from the center of the ball to the point of contact with the ground is 1 meter.

2. **Understand the geometry of the torus:**
   - The torus can be thought of as a circle of radius \(r\) (the radius of the ball) that is rolled around a central circle of radius \(R\) (the distance from the center of the torus to the center of the ball).
   - Given that \(R = 2\) meters and the radius of the ball \(r = 1\) meter, the torus is rolling around a circle of radius 2 meters.

3. **Calculate the volume of the torus:**
   - The volume \(V\) of a torus is given by the formula:
     \[
     V = 2\pi^2 R r^2
     \]
   - Substituting the given values \(R = 2\) meters and \(r = 1\) meter:
     \[
     V = 2\pi^2 \cdot 2 \cdot 1^2 = 4\pi^2
     \]
   - However, we are given that the volume is \(20\pi\) cubic meters, so there must be a mistake in the interpretation or the given values. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - The correct interpretation should be that the torus is rolling around a circle of radius \(R\) and the ball is rolling without slipping, but the given volume \(20\pi\) cubic meters suggests a different radius for the ball or the central circle.
   - Let's assume the correct radius of the ball is \(r\) meters and the correct radius of the central circle is \(R\) meters. The volume formula becomes:
     \[
     V = 2\pi^2 R r^2
     \]
   - Given \(V = 20\pi\):
     \[
     2\pi^2 R r^2 = 20\pi
     \]
   - Simplify by dividing both sides by \(2\pi\):
     \[
     \pi R r^2 = 10
     \]
   - Since the ball is rolling without slipping and the distance from the center of the ball to the point of contact with the ground is 1 meter, the radius of the ball \(r\) must be 1 meter. Substituting \(r = 1\):
     \[
     \pi R \cdot 1^2 = 10
     \]
     \[
     \pi R = 10
     \]
     \[
     R = \frac{10}{\pi}

"To determine the value of \(a\) for which the function \(f(x)\) is convex, we need to analyze the function piecewise and check the convexity of each piece. A function is convex if its second derivative is non-negative over its domain.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a, \\ 
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. 
\end{cases} \]

First, let's find the first and second derivatives of each piece of the function.

For \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2 \]
\[ f'(x) = 2ax \]
\[ f''(x) = 2a \]

For \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a \]
\[ f'(x) = a \]
\[ f''(x) = 0 \]

For the function to be convex, the second derivative must be non-negative over its entire domain. The second derivative \(f''(x)\) is \(2a\) for \(x \geq a\) and \(0\) for \(x < a\). Therefore, for the function to be convex, we need:
\[ 2a \geq 0 \]
\[ a \geq 0 \]

Additionally, we need to ensure that the function is continuous and has a non-decreasing slope at the point \(x = a\). The left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a \]

The right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) is:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a(a)^2 = a^3 \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3 \]
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0 \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0 \]
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0 \]

The solutions to this equation are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a\) must be non-negative for the function to be convex, we discard \(a = -1\). Therefore, the possible values of \(a\) are \(a = 0\) and \(a = 2\).

However, \(a = 0\) would make the function \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x \geq 0\) and \(f(x) = 0\) for \(x < 0\), which is a constant function and not a linear function. Therefore, the only valid value of \(a\) is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the value of \(a\) for which the function \(f(x)\) is convex is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given equation represents a sphere with a diameter of 1, we start by rewriting the equation in the standard form of a sphere's equation. The given equation is:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

We need to complete the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

First, consider the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \). To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). Adding and subtracting this square inside the equation, we get:

\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]

This can be written as:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, consider the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \). To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). Adding and subtracting this square inside the equation, we get:

\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]

This can be written as:

\[ (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:

\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combine the constant terms on the left side:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

Rearrange to isolate the completed squares:

\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\) is in the standard form of a sphere's equation \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 + (z - l)^2 = r^2\), where the center is \((h, k, l)\) and the radius is \(r\). In this case, the center is \((5, -3, l)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

The diameter of the sphere is twice the radius, so the diameter is \(2\sqrt{34 - c}\). We are given that the diameter is 1, so we set up the equation:

\[ 2\sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \]

Solve for \(\sqrt{34 - c}\) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ \sqrt{34 - c} = \frac{1}{2} \]

Square both sides to eliminate the square root:

\[ 34 - c = \frac{1}{4} \]

Solve for \( c \) by isolating it on one side of the equation:

\[ 34 - \frac{1}{4} = c \]

Convert 34 to a fraction with a denominator of 4:

\[ \frac{136}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = c \]

Combine the fractions:

\[ \frac{135}{4} = c \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is:

"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) has a fixed point \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the fixed points of \(f(x)\):**
   A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\). Therefore, we solve the equation:
   \[
   \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
   \]
   Rearranging terms, we get:
   \[
   \lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - x - \lambda x^2 = 0 \implies x(\lambda - 1 - \lambda x) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
   \]
   The fixed point \(x = 0\) is always present. The other fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) exists if \(\lambda > 1\).

2. **Find the points where \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\):**
   We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). First, let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
   \[
   f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x).
   \]
   Let \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\). Then,
   \[
   f(f(x)) = f(y) = \lambda y(1 - y) = \lambda \lambda x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
   \]
   We need to solve the equation:
   \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
   \]
   Rearranging terms, we get:
   \[
   \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us two cases:
   - \(x = 0\), which is a fixed point.
   - \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

   We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\) has a solution \(x \in (0, 1)\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). This means \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

   Let's analyze the polynomial \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
   \[
   4 (1 - x)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) - 1 = 0 \implies 4 (1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 = 0 \implies 8x^2 - 8x + 4 - 4x + 4x^2 - 4 - 1 = 0 \implies 12x^2 - 12x - 1 = 0.
   \]
   Solving this quadratic equation, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{144 + 48}}{24} = \frac{12 \pm \sqrt{192}}{24} = \frac{12 \pm 8\sqrt{3}}{24} = \frac{3 \pm 2\sqrt{3}}{6}.
   \]
   Both solutions are in the interval \((0, 1)\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} = \frac{1}{2}\) is also a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\).

   Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists a \(x \in [0, 1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) are \(\lambda = 2\).

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.

Next, we use the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\):
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A+B)\), we get:
\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

To simplify this, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.

\[

First, we identify the prime numbers less than or equal to 42. These primes are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41. There are 13 such prime numbers.

A positive integer less than \(42!\) that is a factor of \(42!\) can be written in the form \(2^a \cdot 3^b \cdot 5^c \cdot 7^d \cdot 11^e \cdot 13^f \cdot 17^g \cdot 19^h \cdot 23^i \cdot 29^j \cdot 31^k \cdot 37^l \cdot 41^m\), where \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m\) are non-negative integers such that the resulting number is less than \(42!\).

The maximum value for each exponent is the largest integer \(n\) such that \(p^n < 42!\), where \(p\) is the corresponding prime. However, since \(p^n\) for \(p \leq 42\) and \(n \geq 1\) will always be less than \(42!\), the maximum value for each exponent is not bounded by \(42!\) but rather by the number of times the prime can be multiplied without exceeding \(42!\).

The number of choices for each exponent \(a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m\) is infinite in theory, but in practical terms, we are only interested in the number of distinct products of these primes raised to non-negative powers, which is finite and equal to the number of positive integers less than \(42!\) that are factors of \(42!\).

The number of positive integers less than \(42!\) that are factors of \(42!\) is the same as the number of positive integers less than \(42!\), which is \(42!\) itself. However, since we are asked for the number of positive integers less than \(42!\), we exclude 1 itself, which is the number 1.

First, let's consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can use the substitution \( x = \sin \theta \) where \( -\frac{\pi}{2} \le \theta \le \frac{\pi}{2} \). Then \( f(\sin \theta, \sin \theta) = 2 \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \sin 2\theta \). The maximum value of \( \sin 2\theta \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), giving \( x = \sin \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, \( f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = 1 \).

From the above analysis, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1. Therefore, the answer is

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\) given by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle in 3D space. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given that \( z \) is a complex number satisfying the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we can use the properties of the golden ratio. The golden ratio \( \phi \) is given by \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore, we have \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \).

The complex number \( z \) can be written in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \) can be rewritten as:
\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]
Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:
\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]
Thus,
\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The corresponding value of \( \sin\theta \) is:
\[ \sin\theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2\theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

Therefore, \( z \) can be written as:
\[ z = e^{i\theta} = \cos\theta + i\sin\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} + i\frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the property of exponents, we have:
\[ z^{85} = e^{85i\theta} = \cos(85\theta) + i\sin(85\theta), \]
and
\[ \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-85i\theta} = \cos(85\theta) - i\sin(85\theta). \]
Thus,
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = (\cos(85\theta) + i\sin(85\theta)) + (\cos(85\theta) - i\sin(85\theta)) = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we use the fact that \( \theta \) is related to the golden ratio. The golden ratio satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). Therefore, \( \theta \) satisfies:
\[ e^{2i\theta} = \phi e^{i\theta} - 1. \]
This implies that \( e^{2i\theta} \) is also a root of the equation \( x^2 = x + 1 \). The roots of this equation are \( \phi \) and \( -1 \). Since \( e^{i\theta} \) is a complex number on the unit circle, \( e^{2i\theta} \) must also be on the unit circle. Therefore, \( e^{2i\theta} = \phi \) or \( e^{2i\theta} = -1 \).

If \( e^{2i\theta} = -1 \), then \( 2\theta = \pi + 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \), so \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi \). In this case, \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\left(85\left(\frac{\pi}{2} + k\pi\right)\right) = \cos\left(\frac{85\pi}{2} + 85k\pi\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0 \).

If \( e^{2i\theta} = \phi \), then \( 2\theta = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) + 2k\pi \) for some integer \( k \). Since \( \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{\phi}{2}\right) = \frac{\pi}{5} \), we have \( 2\theta = \frac{\pi}{5} + 2k\pi \), so \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{10} + k\pi \). In this case, \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos\left(85\left(\frac{\pi}{10} + k\pi\right)\right) = \cos\left(\frac{85\pi}{10} + 85k\pi\right) = \cos\left(\frac{17\pi}{2} + 85k\pi\right) = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 0 \).

Therefore, in both cases, \( \cos(85\theta) = 0 \), so:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot 0 = 0. \]

\[ \boxed{0}. \]","[0, '0']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"To find the area of triangle \(MEN\), we start by noting that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Therefore, \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, \(M\) and \(N\) are the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively. This means that triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(1:2\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36
\]

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) also divides the area of triangle \(ABC\) into two regions: a smaller triangle \(AMN\) and a quadrilateral \(MBCN\). The area of the quadrilateral \(MBCN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC - \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = 144 - 36 = 108
\]

The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) divides the quadrilateral \(MBCN\) into two smaller quadrilaterals of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(MEN\) is half of the area of quadrilateral \(MBCN\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle Men = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the given information:

1. Let \( S_1 \) be the number of students who read 1 book.
2. Let \( S_2 \) be the number of students who read 2 books.
3. Let \( S_3 \) be the number of students who read 3 books.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- The total number of students is 24.
- The number of students who read 8 books is 8.
- The number of students who read 10 books is 10.
- The number of students who read 6 books is 6.
- The number of students who read 2 books is the sum of the students who read 1 book and the students who read 3 books (since the number of students who read 2 books is the same as the number of students who read 1 book and the number of students who read 3 books combined).

We can express these relationships with the following equations:
1. \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 24 \)
2. \( S_2 = S_1 + S_3 \)
3. The number of students who read 8 books is 8, so \( S_8 = 8 \).
4. The number of students who read 10 books is 10, so \( S_{10} = 10 \).
5. The number of students who read 6 books is 6, so \( S_6 = 6 \).

Since \( S_2 = S_1 + S_3 \), we can substitute \( S_2 \) in the first equation:
\[ S_1 + (S_1 + S_3) + S_3 = 24 \]
\[ 2S_1 + 2S_3 = 24 \]
\[ S_1 + S_3 = 12 \]

Now, we know that \( S_2 = 12 \). The number of students who read 2 books is 12, so the number of students who read 2 books is the sum of the students who read 1 book and the students who read 3 books.

"To determine the amount of money in the account after a certain number of years, we need to know the type of interest being applied. Since the problem does not specify the type of interest, we will assume it is simple interest, which is the most straightforward type of interest calculation.

The formula for simple interest is:
\[ \text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t \]
where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial amount of money),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (in decimal form),
- \( t \) is the time the money is invested for (in years).

The total amount of money \( A \) after \( t \) years is given by:
\[ A = P + \text{Simple Interest} = P + P \times r \times t = P (1 + r \times t) \]

From the problem, we know:
- The principal amount \( P \) is the amount after 4 years, which is \( 200 \).
- The amount after 6 years is \( 500 \).

First, we need to find the annual interest rate \( r \). The difference in time is \( 6 - 4 = 2 \) years, and the difference in the amount is \( 500 - 200 = 300 \). Using the simple interest formula, we can write:
\[ 300 = 200 \times r \times 2 \]
Solving for \( r \):
\[ 300 = 400r \]
\[ r = \frac{300}{400} = 0.75 \]

Now that we have the annual interest rate, we can find the total amount of money after 10 years. The principal amount \( P \) is still \( 200 \), the annual interest rate \( r \) is \( 0.75 \), and the time \( t \) is \( 10 \) years. Using the total amount formula:
\[ A = 200 (1 + 0.75 \times 10) = 200 (1 + 7.5) = 200 \times 8.5 = 1700 \]

- If \(n = 3\), then \(k = 2^8 = 256\).
- If \(n = 4\), then \(k = 2^6 = 64\).

"To determine which player has the highest rating, we need to compare the ratings of the players who have played. The players and their ratings are as follows:

- Player A: 100
- Player B: 90
- Player C: 80
- Player D: 70
- Player E: 60
- Player F: 50
- Player G: 40
- Player H: 30
- Player I: 20
- Player J: 10

We are given that the average rating of the players who have played is 75, and there are 10 players in total. Therefore, the total sum of the ratings of the players who have played is:

\[ 75 \times 10 = 750 \]

We need to find out which player has the highest rating. From the list of players, the highest rating is 100, which belongs to Player J. To confirm that Player J is indeed one of the players who have played, we need to check if the sum of the ratings of the other 9 players is less than or equal to 750.

The sum of the ratings of the other 9 players is:

\[ 100 + 90 + 80 + 70 + 60 + 50 + 40 + 30 + 20 = 550 \]

Since 550 is less than 750, it is possible that Player J is one of the players who have played. Therefore, the player with the highest rating is:

"To find the total area of the shaded region, we need to calculate the area of the two triangles that are shaded. The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\), and the second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

First, let's calculate the area of the first triangle. The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]
Substituting the coordinates of the first triangle \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\), we get:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - 4) + 2(4 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 + 0 + 8 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4

Next, let's calculate the area of the second triangle. Using the same formula, we substitute the coordinates of the second triangle \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\):
\[

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we need to find a number that is a multiple of 450 and has exactly 14 divisors. The number of divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \) is given by:

\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \]

We need this product to equal 14. The possible factorizations of 14 are:

\[ 14 = 14 \times 1 \]
\[ 14 = 7 \times 2 \]
\[ 14 = 2 \times 7 \]
\[ 14 = 2 \times 7 \times 1 \]

We will consider each case separately.

1. For the factorization \( 14 = 14 \times 1 \), the number would be of the form \( p_1^{13} \). However, this form does not include the prime factors 2, 3, and 5, so it cannot be a multiple of 450.
2. For the factorization \( 14 = 7 \times 2 \), the number would be of the form \( p_1^6 \times p_2^1 \). To be a multiple of 450, one of the primes must be 2, one must be 3, and one must be 5.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the last square of the chessboard is occupied by a knight after a series of moves, given that the knight starts on a square with a specific number and moves according to the rules of chess.

### Step 1: Understanding the Knight's Moves
A knight moves in an ""L"" shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular to that direction. This means a knight can move to 8 possible squares from any given square.

### Step 2: Initial Position
The knight starts on a square with the number 4. The possible moves from square 4 are to squares 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11.

### Step 3: General Pattern
We need to determine the pattern of the knight's moves. Let's consider the parity (odd or even nature) of the squares:
- Squares 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ... are odd.
- Squares 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ... are even.

A knight always moves from an odd square to an even square, and from an even square to an odd square. Therefore, if the knight starts on an even square, it will always land on an odd square after an odd number of moves and on an even square after an even number of moves.

### Step 4: Last Move
The problem asks for the probability that the last square is occupied by the knight. Since the knight starts on square 4 (an even square), it will land on an even square after an even number of moves and on an odd square after an odd number of moves.

### Step 5: Conclusion
The last square of the chessboard is square 16, which is an even square. Since the knight will land on an even square after an even number of moves, the last square is occupied by the knight.

Thus, the probability that the last square is occupied by the knight is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To find the sum of the digits of the integer part of the expression \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to calculate the value of the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can simplify this as follows:

\[
5^7 = 78125 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^8 = 256
\]

So,

\[
5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 78125 \cdot 256
\]

To find the product, we can use the distributive property:

\[
78125 \cdot 256 = 78125 \cdot (200 + 50 + 6) = 78125 \cdot 200 + 78125 \cdot 50 + 78125 \cdot 6
\]

Calculating each term separately:

\[
78125 \cdot 200 = 15625000
\]
\[
78125 \cdot 50 = 3906250
\]
\[
78125 \cdot 6 = 468750

Adding these together:

\[
15625000 + 3906250 + 468750 = 19999999

So, the denominator is 19999999. Now, we need to divide 4321 by 19999999:

\[

First, note that \(\sin (180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can pair the terms as follows:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin^2 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 40^\circ \sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin^2 40^\circ,

\[
\sin 60^\circ \sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin^2 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

So, the original product can be rewritten as:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \sin^2 60^\circ \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

Next, we know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ \sin^2 40^\circ \frac{3}{4} \sin^2 80^\circ.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 20^\circ = \cos 70^\circ\), but a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

Next, we substitute the known values of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\), and \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) into the magnitude formula:
\[

Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[

Now, consider the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted by 5. Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's proceed step by step.

First, recall the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\). Using this, we can rewrite \(\sin 20^\circ\) as \(\cos 70^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ\) as \(\cos 50^\circ\). Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ} + \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to rewrite \(\cos^2 70^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 20^\circ\) and \(\cos^2 50^\circ\) as \(\sin^2 40^\circ\). So the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Now, we use the identity \(\cos^2 x = \frac{1 + \cos 2x}{2}\) and \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\). Applying these identities, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{2}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.
\]

We can factor out the 2:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{1 + \cos 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos 80^\circ} \right).
\]

To simplify this, we use the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\). Therefore, \(1 + \cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ\) and \(1 - \cos 40^\circ = 2 \sin^2 20^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)\) and \(1 - \cos 80^\circ = 2 \sin^2 40^\circ = 2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
2 \left( \frac{1}{2 \cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 20^\circ)} + \frac{1}{2 (1 - \cos^2 40^\circ)} \right) = \left( \frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 40^\circ} \right).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 2x = 2 \cos^2 x - 1\) again, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 70^\circ},
\]
\[
\frac{1}{1 - \cos^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.

So the expression is:
\[

We already know from the original problem that this is equal to:

\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

We are given that this sum is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

Since \(n\) must be a whole number (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, we have:

\[

First, we can add \( t \) to both sides of the congruence to eliminate \( -t \) on the right side:

\[ t + 2 + t \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2t + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we subtract 2 from both sides to isolate the term with \( t \):

\[ 2t \equiv -2 \pmod{23} \]

Since \(-2\) is congruent to \( 21 \) modulo 23 (because \(-2 + 23 = 21\)), we can rewrite the congruence as:

\[ 2t \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \]

To solve for \( t \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23. The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:

\[ 2x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) to find this inverse. If we try \( x = 12 \):

\[ 2 \cdot 12 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

So, the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23 is 12. We can now multiply both sides of the congruence \( 2t \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \) by 12:

\[ 12 \cdot 2t \equiv 12 \cdot 21 \pmod{23} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 24t \equiv 252 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), we have:

\[ t \equiv 252 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we reduce 252 modulo 23:

\[ 252 \div 23 \approx 10.9565 \quad \text{(integer part is 10)} \]
\[ 252 - 10 \cdot 23 = 252 - 230 = 22 \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to multiply the number by its conjugate:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

We can use the difference of squares formula to simplify this product. The difference of squares formula states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25

\[

"To determine the 2003rd term of the sequence \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we first recognize that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

For our sequence, we substitute \(a_1 = 1\) and \(d = 2\) into the formula:

1. First, evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Then, subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Finally, evaluate \( g \) at the result from the previous step.

Let's start with the first step. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to use the properties of inverse trigonometric functions. Specifically, we know that for any non-zero real number \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} (x) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This identity can be extended to \(\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\) as follows. Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Then \(\tan \theta = x\) and \(\theta\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\). The cotangent of \(\theta\) is \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta} = \frac{1}{x}\). Therefore,

\[
\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \cot^{-1} (\cot \theta) = \theta.
\]

Thus,

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \theta + \theta = 2\theta.
\]

Given that \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we substitute \(2\theta\) for the argument of the sine function:

\[
\sin (2\theta) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity for sine, \(\sin (2\theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\), we get

\[
2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), we have \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Substituting these into the equation, we get

\[
2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we have

\[
2 \frac{x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

Cross-multiplying gives

\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]

Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:

\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):

\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.

\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|}

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):

\]
Next, we compute the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}

Now, we compute the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\| \mathbf{b} \| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\| (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) \times \mathbf{b} \|}{\| \mathbf{b} \|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we get

\]

We can further expand each term using the distributive property again:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c},

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{0} = 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}.

Combining these results, we have

Using these, we substitute \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\) into the expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

- 6 students earned 12 salary units each.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AB = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AD = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:

\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{a}{d} = \frac{b}{c}

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be split into the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times AC + \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (a + c)
\]

Given that the total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (a + c) = 42 \implies AC \times (a + c) = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the fact that the areas of the triangles formed by the diagonals of a trapezoid are proportional to the lengths of the parallel sides. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{c}{a + c} \times 42
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the rectangle formed by extending the sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) to meet at a point. Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times AC

Given that the total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42, and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the rectangle, we can conclude that:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

First, let's denote the points of intersection of the two circles as \(A\) and \(C\). The radii \(DA\) and \(DC\) are \(1\) and \(2\) respectively, and the distance \(AC\) is the common chord of the two circles.

The area of the region between the two circles is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of one of the circles. Since the area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\) and the area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\), the area of the region between the two circles is \(4\pi - \pi = 3\pi\).

According to the problem, this area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
3\pi = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi
\]
This equation is consistent, confirming the given information.

Next, we need to find the length of the chord \(AC\). Let \(O\) be the midpoint of \(AC\). Then \(OA = OC\) and \(OD\) is the perpendicular distance from the center \(D\) to the chord \(AC\). In the right triangle \(ODA\), we have:
\[
DA^2 = OD^2 + OA^2 \implies 1^2 = OD^2 + OA^2 \implies 1 = OD^2 + OA^2
\]
In the right triangle \(ODC\), we have:
\[
DC^2 = OD^2 + OC^2 \implies 2^2 = OD^2 + OC^2 \implies 4 = OD^2 + OC^2
\]
Since \(OA = OC\), we can substitute \(OC\) with \(OA\) in the second equation:
\[
4 = OD^2 + OA^2
\]
Now we have two equations:
1. \(1 = OD^2 + OA^2\)
2. \(4 = OD^2 + OA^2\)

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[
3 = 3OA^2 \implies OA^2 = 1 \implies OA = 1
\]
Thus, \(OC = 1\) and \(AC = 2 \times OA = 2 \times 1 = 2\).

Now, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\). In the right triangle \(ODA\), we have:
\[
\sin \left(\frac{\angle ADC}{2}\right) = \frac{OA}{DA} = \frac{1}{1} = 1 \implies \frac{\angle ADC}{2} = 90^\circ \implies \angle ADC = 180^\circ

However, this result is incorrect because it implies that the points \(A\) and \(C\) are collinear, which is not possible given the problem constraints. Let's re-evaluate the problem using the correct approach.

The correct approach is to use the fact that the area of the sector \(ADC\) minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\) is equal to the area of the region between the two circles. The area of the sector \(ADC\) is:

\text{Area of sector } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \angle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \angle ADC
\]
The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times OD = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times \sqrt{1^2 - 1^2} = 0
\]
Thus, the area of the region between the two circles is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \angle ADC = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi \implies \frac{1}{2} \angle ADC = \frac{5}{3} \pi \implies \angle ADC = \frac{10}{3} \pi
\]

However, this result is also incorrect because it implies that the points \(A\) and \(C\) are not on the same circle. The correct approach is to use the fact that the area of the sector \(ADC\) minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\) is equal to the area of the region between the two circles.

"To determine how many bowling balls are needed to bowl a 6-meter radius bowling ball, we need to calculate the surface area of both the larger and the smaller bowling balls and then find the ratio of these surface areas.

The formula for the surface area \(A\) of a sphere is given by:
\[ A = 4\pi r^2 \]
where \(r\) is the radius of the sphere.

First, let's calculate the surface area of the larger bowling ball:
\[ r_{\text{large}} = 8 \text{ cm} \]
\[ A_{\text{large}} = 4\pi (8)^2 = 4\pi \times 64 = 256\pi \text{ square cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the surface area of the smaller bowling ball:
\[ r_{\text{small}} = 3 \text{ cm} \]
\[ A_{\text{small}} = 4\pi (3)^2 = 4\pi \times 9 = 36\pi \text{ square cm} \]

The ratio of the surface area of the larger bowling ball to the surface area of the smaller bowling ball is:
\[ \frac{A_{\text{large}}}{A_{\text{small}}} = \frac{256\pi}{36\pi} = \frac{256}{36} = \frac{64}{9} \]

This means that the surface area of the larger bowling ball is \(\frac{64}{9}\) times the surface area of the smaller bowling ball. Therefore, the number of smaller bowling balls needed to bowl one larger bowling ball is:
\[ \frac{64}{9} \]

So, the number of bowling balls needed is:

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4 = A\) and \(\arcsin 0.5 = B\). Then, we need to find \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\).

First, we use the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = \sin B \cos A - \cos B \sin A.
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin A = 0.4\) and \(\sin B = 0.5\). To find \(\cos A\) and \(\cos B\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x}\):
\[
\cos A = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 A} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos B = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 B} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the sine addition and subtraction formulas:
\[
\sin (A + B) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (B - A) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we find the product \(\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A)\):
\[
\sin (A + B) \cdot \sin (B - A) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula \( (a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2 \):
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 12 = 9.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine if it is possible to form a committee of 5 members such that each party has at least one member in the committee. Let's denote the parties as \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \), with the number of members in each party as follows:
- Party \( A \): 8 members
- Party \( B \): 8 members
- Party \( C \): 6 members

We need to form a committee of 5 members such that each party is represented by at least one member. This means that the committee must include at least one member from each party \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \).

First, let's consider the minimum number of members required from each party to form such a committee:
- At least 1 member from Party \( A \)
- At least 1 member from Party \( B \)
- At least 1 member from Party \( C \)

This leaves us with \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) members to be chosen from the remaining members of the parties. The remaining members are:
- Party \( A \): \( 8 - 1 = 7 \) members
- Party \( B \): \( 8 - 1 = 7 \) members
- Party \( C \): \( 6 - 1 = 5 \) members

The total number of remaining members is \( 7 + 7 + 5 = 19 \). We need to choose 2 members from these 19 remaining members. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula \( \binom{19}{2} \):
\[
\binom{19}{2} = \frac{19 \times 18}{2 \times 1} = 171

2. \(\frac{a + b + c}{3} = 24\)

From the second condition, we can find the sum of the integers:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we need to eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. Start with the given equation:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. Cube both sides to remove the cube root:
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3

   Simplifying both sides, we get:

   Simplifying the left side, we get:

   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   Here, \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092)}}{2 \cdot 1}

Therefore, \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( AM \) is the altitude, and \( \angle BMA = \angle CMA = 90^\circ \).

Using the right triangle \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2. \]
Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then \( BC = 2x \) and:
\[ AB^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2. \]

In \( \triangle BDC \), since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BCD = \angle ABC = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \), we can use the Law of Sines:
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle DBC}. \]
Since \( BD + CD = BC = 2x \) and \( \angle DBC = \angle ABC = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \), we have:
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}. \]
Since \( BD = CD \), we have:
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}. \]
Using the triple angle identity \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \), we get:
\[ \frac{2x}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}. \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( AD = 10 \) and the properties of the triangle. Since \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \), we can use the fact that \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \) are similar to \( \triangle ABC \) and the given angle condition to find \( x \).

Using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle, we can find that \( x = 5 \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x = 10 \).

Now, we can find \( AB \):
\[ AB^2 = 121 + 5^2 = 121 + 25 = 146. \]
Thus, \( AB = \sqrt{146} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 > 0\]

Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2 + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 + 4 = (x^2 + 2)^2\]

Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square of a real number, it is always non-negative. Therefore, \((x^2 + 2)^2 > 0\) for all real \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0\]

Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\]

We need to solve the quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\). First, we find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}\]

So, the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7\]

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards (since the coefficient of \(y^2\) is positive). The quadratic is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[-7 < y < 3\]

Recall that \(y = x^2\). So, we have:
\[-7 < x^2 < 3\]

Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the inequality \(-7 < x^2\) is always true. Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[0 \le x^2 < 3\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

### Step 3: Combine the solutions

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is true for all real \(x\). From Step 2, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is true for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To solve for \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations \(xyz = 4\), \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), and \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we will use the identity for the sum of cubes and some algebraic manipulations.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get
\[-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).\]

Now, let's denote \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). The equation becomes
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

We also have the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
We can factor this expression as
\[xy(y+z) + xz(z+x) + yz(x+y) = 12.\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can rewrite \(y+z = s-x\), \(z+x = s-y\), and \(x+y = s-z\). Substituting these into the equation, we get
\[xy(s-x) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-z) = 12,\]
which expands to
\[s(xy + xz + yz) - (x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y) = 12.\]
We know that \(xy + yz + zx = p\) and \(x^2 y + x^2 z + y^2 x + y^2 z + z^2 x + z^2 y = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 12\). Substituting these values in, we get
\[sp - (sp - 12) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[12 = 12,\]
which is true but does not provide new information.

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(sp - (sp - 12) = 12\).

From the first equation, we can solve for \(s^2 - 3p\):
\[s^2 - 3p = -\frac{8}{s}.\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{s^3 + 8}{3s}\) into the second equation, we get
\[s \left(\frac{s^3 + 8}{3s}\right) = 12,\]
which simplifies to
\[\frac{s^3 + 8}{3} = 12,\]
and further simplifies to
\[s^3 + 8 = 36,\]
so
\[s^3 = 28,\]
and
\[s = \sqrt[3]{28}.\]

Substituting \(s = \sqrt[3]{28}\) back into the expression for \(p\), we get
\[p = \frac{(\sqrt[3]{28})^3 + 8}{3(\sqrt[3]{28})} = \frac{28 + 8}{3(\sqrt[3]{28})} = \frac{36}{3(\sqrt[3]{28})} = \frac{12}{\sqrt[3]{28}} = \frac{12}{2\sqrt[3]{7}} = \frac{6}{\sqrt[3]{7}} = 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt[3]{49}}{7} = \frac{6\sqrt[3]{49}}{7}.\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the problem as the correct approach should be simpler. Let's recheck the problem with simpler values. If we assume \(x = 2\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 2\), then:
\[xyz = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4,\]
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 2^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 = 8 + 1 + 8 = 17,\]
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 2 \cdot 1^2 + 2^2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 2^2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1^2 \cdot 2 = 2 + 4 + 8 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 28.\]

This does not satisfy the given equations. Let's re-evaluate the problem with correct values. The correct values are \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\):

This does not satisfy the given equations. The correct values are \(x = 1\), \(y = 2\), and \(z = 2\):
\[xyz = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 = 4,\]
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 1^3 + 2^3 + 2^3 = 1 + 8 + 8 = 17,\]
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1^2 \cdot 2 + 1 \cdot 2^2 + 1^2 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 2^2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 8 + 8 = 28.\]

This does not satisfy the given equations. The correct values are \(x = 1\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 4\):

"To determine the number of students in the 9th grade who scored above 80% in the math test, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in the 9th grade.
2. Calculate the number of students in the 9th grade who scored above 80% in the math test.

First, we know that 41.1% of the students in the 9th grade scored 90% or above, and this number is 39.4% of the total number of students in the 9th grade. Let's denote the total number of students in the 9th grade by \( N \).

From the given data, we have:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the expression step by step.

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0.
\]
The expression \(x^2 - 36x\) can be factored as:
\[
x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).
\]
So the inequality becomes:
\[
\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)} < 0.
\]
Next, we need to determine the critical points where the expression changes sign. These points are the values of \(x\) that make the numerator or the denominator zero. The numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\) is zero when \(x^2 - 81 = 0\), which gives \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\). The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\). Therefore, the critical points are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\).

We will test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these critical points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   - Choose \(x = -10\).
   - The numerator \(|(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-10)(-10 - 36) = (-10)(-46) = 460\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   - Choose \(x = -1\).
   - The numerator \(|(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((-1)(-1 - 36) = (-1)(-37) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   - Choose \(x = 1\).
   - The numerator \(|1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((1)(1 - 36) = (1)(-35) = -35\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   - Choose \(x = 10\).
   - The numerator \(|10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((10)(10 - 36) = (10)(-26) = -260\), which is negative.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   - Choose \(x = 37\).
   - The numerator \(|37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288\), which is positive.
   - The denominator \((37)(37 - 36) = (37)(1) = 37\), which is positive.
   - Therefore, \(\frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, we see that the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Since the expression is undefined at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), these points are not included in the solution set.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the area of the grassy part of the field, we need to calculate the area of the semicircle and subtract the area of the triangle from the total area of the rectangle.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the same as the length of the chord of the semicircle, which is 400 meters. The width of the rectangle is the diameter of the semicircle, which is twice the radius.

The radius \( r \) of the semicircle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The chord of the semicircle is 400 meters, so half of the chord is 200 meters. The radius is the hypotenuse of a right triangle with one leg of 200 meters and the other leg of 100 meters (since the height of the triangle is the radius minus the height of the semicircle, which is 100 meters).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ r^2 = 200^2 + 100^2 \]
\[ r^2 = 40000 + 10000 \]
\[ r^2 = 50000 \]
\[ r = \sqrt{50000} \]
\[ r = 100\sqrt{5} \]

The area of the semicircle is half the area of the full circle:
\[ \text{Area of the semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (100\sqrt{5})^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi (50000) = 25000\pi \]

The area of the triangle is:
\[ \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 \times 100 = 20000 \]

The area of the grassy part of the field is the area of the semicircle minus the area of the triangle:
\[ \text{Area of the grassy part} = 25000\pi - 20000 \]

Using the approximation \(\pi \approx 3.14\):
\[ \text{Area of the grassy part} \approx 25000 \times 3.14 - 20000 = 78500 - 20000 = 58500 \]

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\), and the hypotenuse \(RS = 5\), we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the length of the opposite side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can solve for \(ST\):
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side \(RT\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So, we have:
\[
RS^2 = RT^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RT^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RT^2 + 4
\]
\[
RT^2 = 21
\]
\[
RT = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin T\). For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Therefore, we have:

"To find the shortest distance from the origin to the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \( D \) between these two points is given by:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} \]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]
\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To minimize \( D \), we minimize \( D^2 \) instead, which is a simpler function:

\[ D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \]

Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the function becomes:

\[ f(u) = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2} \]

To find the minimum value of \( f(u) \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:

\[ f'(u) = u - 2 \]
\[ u - 2 = 0 \]
\[ u = 2 \]

Since \( u = x^2 \), we have:

\[ x^2 = 2 \]
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{2} \]

We substitute \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \) back into the equation of the curve to find the corresponding \( y \)-coordinates:

For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((\sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((- \sqrt{2})^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-1) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

So, the points on the curve closest to the origin are \( \left( \sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \) and \( \left( -\sqrt{2}, -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \). The distance from either point to the origin is:

\[ D = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + \left( -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{2}{4}} = \sqrt{2 + \frac{1}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the shortest distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), which is in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \) with \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 0 \).

The function \( f(x) \) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 
3 - x & \text{if } x \leq 3, \\
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x & \text{if } x > 3.
\end{cases} \]

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = 3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
Factoring the quadratic expression:
\[ x(-x - 1)(x - 3) = 0 \]
Setting each factor to zero:
\[ x = 0, \quad x = -1, \quad x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 0 \) and \( x = -1 \) do not satisfy \( x > 3 \), the only solution is \( x = 3 \).

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x) = 6 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ -x = 3 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( x = -3 \) is a solution.

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. We can factor \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 \) as:
\[ -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) \]
Setting \( -(x - 2)(x^2 + 3) = 0 \):
\[ x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = -3 \]
Since \( x^2 = -3 \) has no real solutions, the only real solution is \( x = 2 \).

Thus, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = 2 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the angles between the line segment \(BP\) and the edges of the cube that meet at vertex \(B\). The cube has vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F, G,\) and \(H\), where \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) are on the bottom face, and \(E, F, G,\) and \(H\) are on the top face. The line segment \(BP\) is given to have a length of 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

First, let's place the cube in a coordinate system with \(B\) at the origin \((0,0,0)\). The vertices of the cube are:
- \(A = (1,0,0)\)
- \(C = (0,1,0)\)
- \(D = (0,-1,0)\)
- \(E = (0,0,1)\)
- \(F = (0,0,-1)\)
- \(G = (1,1,1)\)
- \(H = (1,-1,1)\)

The line segment \(BP\) is the distance from \(B\) to \(P\), which is given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the angles between \(BP\) and the edges \(BC\), \(BD\), \(BE\), \(BF\), and \(BG\).

The direction vectors of the edges are:
- \(BC = C - B = (-1, 1, 0)\)
- \(BD = D - B = (-1, -1, 0)\)
- \(BE = E - B = (0, 0, 1)\)
- \(BF = F - B = (0, 0, -1)\)
- \(BG = G - B = (1, 1, 1)\)

The angle \(\theta\) between two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{v}}{\|\mathbf{u}\| \|\mathbf{v}\|}
\]

Let's calculate the angles one by one.

1. **Angle between \(BP\) and \(BC\):**
   - Let \(\mathbf{u} = (u_1, u_2, u_3)\) be the direction vector of \(BP\).
   - \(\mathbf{u} \cdot BC = u_1(-1) + u_2(1) + u_3(0) = -u_1 + u_2\)
   - \(\|\mathbf{u}\| = \sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}\)
   - \(\|BC\| = \sqrt{(-1)^2 + 1^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{2}\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \frac{-u_1 + u_2}{\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2} \sqrt{2}}\)

2. **Angle between \(BP\) and \(BD\):**
   - \(\mathbf{u} \cdot BD = u_1(-1) + u_2(-1) + u_3(0) = -u_1 - u_2\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \frac{-u_1 - u_2}{\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2} \sqrt{2}}\)

3. **Angle between \(BP\) and \(BE\):**
   - \(\mathbf{u} \cdot BE = u_1(0) + u_2(0) + u_3(1) = u_3\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \frac{u_3}{\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}}\)

4. **Angle between \(BP\) and \(BF\):**
   - \(\mathbf{u} \cdot BF = u_1(0) + u_2(0) + u_3(-1) = -u_3\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \frac{-u_3}{\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}}\)

5. **Angle between \(BP\) and \(BG\):**
   - \(\mathbf{u} \cdot BG = u_1(1) + u_2(1) + u_3(1) = u_1 + u_2 + u_3\)
   - \(\cos \theta = \frac{u_1 + u_2 + u_3}{\sqrt{u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2}}\)

Since the direction vector \(\mathbf{u}\) is the same for all these angles, the angles will be the same for each pair of edges. Therefore, the angles between \(BP\) and the edges \(BC\), \(BD\), \(BE\), \(BF\), and \(BG\) are all the same.

However, in this problem, we are not given the heat absorbed or released, the change in temperature, or the time taken. Instead, we are given the masses of the steel ball and the basketball, and we need to find the ratio of their specific heat capacities.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is a property that depends only on the material of the substance and not on its mass or the amount of heat absorbed or released. Therefore, the specific heat capacity of the steel ball is the same as the specific heat capacity of the basketball.

"To determine which of the given numbers \(629_{10}\) has a base 7 and base 8 representation that both contain the digit 1, we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8 and then check for the presence of the digit 1 in each representation.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:

\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

### Step 3: Check for the digit 1 in the base 7 and base 8 representations

- The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\), which contains the digit 1.
- The base 8 representation is \(1165_8\), which also contains the digit 1.

Since both representations contain the digit 1, the number \(629_{10}\) satisfies the condition.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Since \( g(x) \) is the same as \( f(x-1) \), we need to substitute \( x-1 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we need to expand each term in the expression. Starting with \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

Next, we expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

Next, we expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combining like terms, we get:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

\[ 3 + (-12) + 23 + (-31) + 15. \]

Combining these, we get:
\[ 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15 = (3 + 23 + 15) + (-12 - 31) = 41 - 43 = -2. \]

\]

where \( (x_1, y_1) \) is the point and \( Ax + By + C = 0 \) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) in the standard form \( Ax + By + C = 0 \):

\[

\]

Here, \( A = 2 \), \( B = -1 \), and \( C = -2 \). The point \( (x_1, y_1) \) is \( (6, 0) \). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[

\[

\[

\[

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). To do this, we can use the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time. Let's denote:
\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3.

We know that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0.
\]
Using \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\), we substitute:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(-2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-2\alpha_1\alpha_2 - \alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0.
\]
Factoring out \((\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\), we get:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4 - \alpha_1\alpha_2 - 2) = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 \neq 0\) (because the polynomial has no real roots and the sum of the roots is \(-2\)), we have:
\[
\alpha_3\alpha_4 - \alpha_1\alpha_2 - 2 = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_3\alpha_4 - 2.
\]
From Vieta's formulas, we know \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), so \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\). Substituting this in, we get:
\[
S_1 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2} - 2.
\]

Similarly, we can find \(S_2\) and \(S_3\):
\[
S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_2\alpha_3} - 2,
\]
\[
S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \frac{2}{\alpha_2\alpha_4} - 2.
\]

However, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots taken three at a time is zero to find the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 0 - 0 = 0.
\]

Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]

Since \(S_1 = S_2 = S_3\), we get:
\[
3S_1 = 0 \implies S_1 = 0.

Therefore, the values of the expressions are:

1. **Find the cost of a PHP 1 bill in US dollars:**

   We know that:
   - The cost of 3 PHP 1 bills and 1 PHP 5 bill is $1.24.
   - The cost of 1 PHP 1 bill and 1 PHP 8 bill is $1.82.

   Let's denote the cost of a PHP 1 bill in US dollars as \( x \) and the cost of a PHP 5 bill in US dollars as \( y \). We can write the following system of equations based on the given information:
   \[
   3x + y = 1.24
   \]
   \[
   x + 8y = 1.82
   \]

   We can solve this system of equations using the elimination method. First, we will eliminate \( y \) by making the coefficients of \( y \) in both equations equal. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 8:
   \[
   24x + 8y = 9.92
   \]
   Now we subtract the second equation from this new equation:
   \[
   (24x + 8y) - (x + 8y) = 9.92 - 1.82
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   23x = 8.10

   Solving for \( x \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{8.10}{23} = 0.352173913 \approx 0.3522

   So, the cost of a PHP 1 bill in US dollars is approximately $0.3522.

"To determine the value of the digit in the thousandths place of the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form. We do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

Let's carry out the division step by step:

1. \(500\) goes into \(137\) zero times, so we write \(0.\) and bring down a \(0\) to make it \(1370\).
2. \(500\) goes into \(1370\) two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)), so we write \(2\) after the decimal point. Now, we subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
3. We bring down another \(0\) to make it \(3700\).
4. \(500\) goes into \(3700\) seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)), so we write \(7\) after the \(2\). Now, we subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
5. We bring down another \(0\) to make it \(2000\).
6. \(500\) goes into \(2000\) four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)), so we write \(4\) after the \(7\). Now, we subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the cyclic quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is also inside the circumcircle of the quadrilateral, we need to understand the geometric properties of the quadrilateral and its circumcircle.

Given that \(ABCD\) is a cyclic quadrilateral with center \(O\) and \(AB/AD = k\), we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point inside \(ABCD\) is also inside the circumcircle of \(ABCD\).

The circumcircle of a cyclic quadrilateral is the circle that passes through all four vertices of the quadrilateral. Since \(ABCD\) is cyclic, the circumcircle is the circle that passes through points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

The area of the circumcircle is given by \(\pi R^2\), where \(R\) is the circumradius of the quadrilateral. The area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the area inside the circumcircle but outside the quadrilateral itself.

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside \(ABCD\) is also inside the circumcircle is the ratio of the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) to the area of the circumcircle. However, since the quadrilateral is cyclic, the area of the quadrilateral is exactly the area inside the circumcircle but outside the quadrilateral itself, which is the area of the circumcircle minus the area of the quadrilateral.

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside \(ABCD\) is also inside the circumcircle is the ratio of the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) to the area of the circumcircle, which is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, the probability is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). First, we find the quotient \(q\):

\[
q = \left\lfloor \frac{54}{6} \right\rfloor = 9
\]

Next, we calculate the product of the quotient and the divisor:

\[
bq = 6 \times 9 = 54
\]

Now, we find the remainder \(r\) by subtracting this product from \(a\):

\[
r = a - bq = 54 - 54 = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given values and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\ 
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4. 
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given values step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \).
   - Since \( 1.05 < 4 \), we use the ceiling function: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.71 \), we have \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.71 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), we have \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money the person has left after spending with Landa, Sarah, June, and Kuna, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money spent.
2. Subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money the person had.

First, let's find the total amount spent:
- Landa spent \$27.47.
- Sarah spent \$35.23.
- June spent \$37.37.
- Kuna spent \$26.52.

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Let's add them step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount spent is \$126.59.

Next, we subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount of money the person had. The person initially had \$100.00.

\[
100.00 - 126.59 = -26.59
\]

Since the result is negative, it means the person spent more than they had, and they are short by \$26.59. Therefore, the person has no money left and is in debt by \$26.59.

The answer is \(\boxed{-26.59}\).","[-26.5900000000000, '-26.59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the mean score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide that by the number of students. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Calculate the total score for each group of students:
   - 20 students scored 80 each: \(20 \times 80 = 1600\)
   - 8 students scored 90 each: \(8 \times 90 = 720\)
   - 2 students scored 100 each: \(2 \times 100 = 200\)

2. Add up the total scores from all the groups:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
   \]

3. Divide the total score by the number of students to find the mean:

Therefore, the mean score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals of the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid is the same. The grid is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n-3+3+n+1 = 2n+1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n+2+2n-9+1 = 3n-6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2+n+n-1 = 2n+1
\]

We observe that the sum of the numbers in the first and third rows is the same, which is \( 2n+1 \). For the sums to be equal, the sum of the numbers in the second row must also be \( 2n+1 \). Therefore, we set the sum of the second row equal to \( 2n+1 \):
\[
3n-6 = 2n+1
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:
\[
n-6 = 1
\]

Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how far Jim and Martha are from the center of the rectangular field, we need to find the distance from the center to the edge of the field. The center of a rectangle is the point where the diagonals intersect, and the distance from the center to any edge is half the length of the diagonal.

First, we need to find the length of the diagonal of the rectangular field. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

The distance from the center to any edge is half of the diagonal:
\[ \text{Distance from the center to the edge} = \frac{d}{2} = \frac{500}{2} = 250 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Jim and Martha are \(\boxed{250}\) feet from the center of the field.","[250, '250']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the property of cube roots of unity, \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[

"To find the shortest distance from point \( A \) to the line segment \( BC \), we need to determine the perpendicular distance from point \( A \) to the line passing through points \( B \) and \( C \).

First, let's find the equation of the line \( BC \). The coordinates of \( B \) are \( (3, 0) \) and the coordinates of \( C \) are \( (0, -4) \). The slope \( m \) of the line \( BC \) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{-4 - 0}{0 - 3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]
Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \) and point \( B(3, 0) \), we get:
\[
y - 0 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 3) \implies y = \frac{4}{3}x - 4
\]
Rewriting this in standard form \( ax + by + c = 0 \), we have:
\[
4x - 3y - 12 = 0
\]

Next, we use the formula for the distance from a point \( (x_1, y_1) \) to a line \( ax + by + c = 0 \), which is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}
\]
Here, the point \( A \) is \( (-3, 3) \), and the line is \( 4x - 3y - 12 = 0 \). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
