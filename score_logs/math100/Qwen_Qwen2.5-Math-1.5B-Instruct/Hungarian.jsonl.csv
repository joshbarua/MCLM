"To determine the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We know that \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \) because it is a right angle. The length of \(EF\) is given as 7, and we are given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \( \sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} \).

Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the value of \( w \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in standard form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Find the rotation of \( z \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise around \( c \):**
   - First, translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:
     \[
     z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
     \]
   - Rotate the translated point by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise. The rotation matrix for \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is:
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix}
     \cos\frac{\pi}{4} & -\sin\frac{\pi}{4} \\

"To find the value of \(\sqrt{242}\), we can start by factoring 242 into its prime factors.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number):
\[242 \div 2 = 121\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we factor 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 7, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 = 2 \times 11^2\]

Now, we can take the square root of both sides:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine how many times Hanya double-checks her homework if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas each check her homework once, we need to consider that each of them checks her homework independently of the others. This means that each of them will check her homework once, regardless of whether the other two are also checking it.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Hanya double-checks her homework.
2. Pierre double-checks her homework.
3. Rosa double-checks her homework.
4. Thomas double-checks her homework.

Since each of the three other people (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) will each check her homework once, we add 1 for each of them to the initial check by Hanya. Therefore, the total number of times Hanya double-checks her homework is:

"To find the coefficient of the \(x^5\) term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x^5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to determine the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is 5. The exponent of \(x\) in the term \((10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\) is:

\[
3(5-k) + (-2k) = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to 5 and solve for \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 5
\]
\[
10 = 5k
\]
\[
k = 2
\]

So, the term we are interested in is the term where \(k = 2\). Substituting \(k = 2\) into the general term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^{5-2} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = \binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2
\]

Now, we simplify this expression step by step. First, we calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Next, we simplify \((10x^3)^3\):

\[
(10x^3)^3 = 10^3 x^{3 \cdot 3} = 1000 x^9
\]

Then, we simplify \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{x^4} = \frac{1}{4x^4}
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 1000 x^9 \cdot \frac{1}{4x^4} = 10 \cdot 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot x^{9-4} = 10 \cdot 250 \cdot x^5 = 2500 x^5

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 = 7k + 2 + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = 7k + 2 + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = 7k + 2 + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

Now, we need to find the remainder when each of these terms is divided by 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

So, we have:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Next, we calculate the product \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):

\[

\]
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric transformation involved. When a regular hexagon is rotated 180 degrees about its center, each vertex of the hexagon will move to the position of the vertex directly opposite to it. This means that the hexagon will be in the same position as it was originally, but flipped over.

A regular hexagon has 6 vertices. When we rotate the hexagon 180 degrees about its center, each vertex will move to the position of the vertex that is directly opposite to it. This means that each vertex will have moved to a new position, but the overall shape and orientation of the hexagon will be the same as the original, just flipped over.

Therefore, to return the hexagon to its original position, we need to perform the same 180-degree rotation again. This will bring each vertex back to its original position.

So, the minimum number of rotations needed to return the hexagon to its original position is 2.

"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). This means we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the coordinates. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex \(D\) is such that the coordinates satisfy the condition \(x > 7\). Let's re-calculate the coordinates of \(D\) correctly.

The correct coordinates of \(D\) should be:
\[
D(8, -1)
\]

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + (-1) = 7

"To find \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) where \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\) in a right triangle:
   \[
   \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can write:
   \[
   \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}
   \]

2. Let the length of the side adjacent to \(\angle A\) be \(x\). Then the length of the side opposite to \(\angle A\) is \(2x\). The hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   \text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{x^2 + (2x)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4x^2} = \sqrt{5x^2} = x\sqrt{5}
   \]

3. Now, we can find \(\tan A\):
   \[
   \tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{2x}{x} = 2

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We start by factoring the denominator:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the potential vertical asymptotes:

\[
(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
\]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches infinity. We do this by dividing the numerator and the denominator by the highest power of \( x \) in the denominator, which is \( x^2 \):

\[
f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} = \frac{\frac{2x}{x^2}}{\frac{x^2}{x^2} - \frac{5x}{x^2} - \frac{14}{x^2}} = \frac{\frac{2}{x}}{1 - \frac{5}{x} - \frac{14}{x^2}}
\]

As \( x \) approaches infinity, the terms \(\frac{2}{x}\), \(\frac{5}{x}\), and \(\frac{14}{x^2}\) all approach zero. Therefore, the function simplifies to:

\[
f(x) \approx \frac{0}{1 - 0 - 0} = 0
\]

Thus, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have found that \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these values together:

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is:

"To determine the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Let's start by expressing the given expression in a more manageable form.

First, observe that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten by factoring out a common term. Notice that \(99\) can be written as \(100 - 1\). However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the expression resembles the expanded form of \((100 - 1)^2\).

Let's expand \((100 - 1)^2\):
\[
(100 - 1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801

Now, let's compare this with our original expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\):
\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100 - 1)^2 + 99 + 1

We already know that \((100 - 1)^2 = 9801\). So, we substitute this value in:
\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1
\]

Next, we add the numbers together:
\[
9801 + 99 = 9900
\]
\[
9900 + 1 = 9901

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{9901}\).","[9901, '9901']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",True

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 28}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \):
\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}

Therefore, the smallest possible value of \( C \) is:

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\]

We need to find the value of \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we note that since \(z^5 = 1\), it follows that \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\), \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\), and \(z^2 = \frac{1}{z^3}\). Using these relationships, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:

\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

Now, we can combine the fractions:

Let's simplify the first equation:
\[ T + 3S + G = T \]
Subtract \( T \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + G = 0 \]
This implies:
\[ G = -3S \]

Now, substitute \( G = -3S \) into the second equation:
\[ 2T + (-3S) = S \]
Simplify the equation:
\[ 2T - 3S = S \]
Add \( 3S \) to both sides:
\[ 2T = 4S \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ T = 2S \]

"To solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in the given polynomials, we need to find the product of the two polynomials and match the coefficients with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\).

The two polynomials are \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). Let's multiply them together:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will expand this product term by term:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, let's combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation, we can solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for the coefficient of \(t\):

\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Next, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into the equation for the coefficient of \(t^3\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 26 \implies 6 + 20 = 26 \implies 26 = 26
\]

And for the coefficient of \(t^2\):

\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -8 \implies -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \implies -8 = -8
\]

All the equations are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the path of the tarp, we need to analyze the given information and use the appropriate geometric relationships.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The circumference of the tarp is \(20\pi\) meters.
   - The width of the tarp (which is the distance it can be extended perpendicularly) is 4 meters.

2. **Calculate the radius of the tarp:**
   The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   C = 2\pi r
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius. Given that the circumference is \(20\pi\), we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2\pi r = 20\pi
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(2\pi\), we get:
   \[
   r = 10
   \]
   So, the radius of the tarp is 10 meters.

3. **Determine the radius of the path of the tarp:**
   The path of the tarp is a circle with a radius that is the sum of the radius of the tarp and the width of the tarp. Therefore, the radius of the path is:
   \[
   10 + 4 = 14 \text{ meters}

Thus, the radius of the path of the tarp is \(\boxed{14}\) meters.","[14, '14']",\sqrt{5},[],False
"To determine the smallest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the function in two parts: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{ha } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{ha } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, consider the part of the function for \(x \geq a\):
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin. For \(x \geq a\), the function \(ax^2\) is always non-negative if \(a > 0\).

Next, consider the part of the function for \(x < a\):
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
This is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). For \(x < a\), the function \(ax + 2a\) is a linear function.

To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to check the continuity and the behavior of the function at \(x = a\). Specifically, we need to ensure that the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the left is less than or equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the right.

The value of the function at \(x = a\) from the right is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

The value of the function at \(x = a\) from the left is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), we need:
\[ a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]

The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq 2. \]

Since \(a\) must be positive (otherwise the parabola \(ax^2\) would not be defined for \(x \geq a\)), we discard \(a \leq -1\) and keep \(a \geq 2\).

Therefore, the smallest value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The second solution is valid only if \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\), which simplifies to \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 2\). Therefore, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(0 \leq \lambda \leq 2\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). This means that \(x\) is not a fixed point of \(f\), but it is a periodic point of period 2. Let's denote \(y = f(x)\). Then we have \(f(y) = x\), which gives us:
\[
f(f(x)) = x \implies f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
Substituting \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a complicated equation, so let's consider the case when \(x\) is not a fixed point. We need to check the behavior of the function \(f\) for different values of \(\lambda\).

For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1).
\]
Simplifying the expression, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 4x(1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1).
\]
We need to solve:
\[
4x(1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = x.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4x(1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) - x = 0 \implies x(4(1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or:
\[
4(1 - x)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
4(2x^2 - 2x + 1 - 2x^3 + 2x^2 - x) - 1 = 0 \implies 4(4x^2 - 2x^3 - 3x + 1) - 1 = 0 \implies 16x^2 - 8x^3 - 12x + 4 - 1 = 0 \implies -8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0.
\]
This is a cubic equation, and we can check that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution:
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.
\]
Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution, and \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), so \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\). This means that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point, not a periodic point of period 2.

For \(\lambda > 2\), the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) will have more fixed points and periodic points of period 2. Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) are \(\lambda > 2\).

"To solve the given problem, we need to simplify the expression for \(\tan \theta\). The expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall the following identities:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B = \sin (A - B)
\]
\[
\cos A \sin B + \sin A \cos B = \sin (A + B)
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ)
\]

Using the sine addition formula, we get:

\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Now, we can substitute these simplified expressions back into the original expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos (90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin (90^\circ - 5^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos (90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin (90^\circ - 5^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

Finally, we recognize that this is the tangent of the angle \(25^\circ - 5^\circ = 20^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \tan 20^\circ

\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime \(5\), we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (125, 625, etc.) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Adding these together, we get:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \ge y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then
\[ f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then
\[ f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then
\[ f(-1, 1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then
\[ f(-1, -1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]

Now, we consider the case where \( x = y \). Then,
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can use calculus. Let \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). Then,
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Evaluating \( g(x) \) at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), we get
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]
Similarly,
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1. \]
Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \( 1 \).

Thus, the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) in 3D space, which is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \|
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated as follows:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]

\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

So, the cross product is \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we need to find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Now, we can find the area of the triangle \(OAB\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, we can write \( z \) in the form \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). This implies \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the given equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Thus, we have:

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta. \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we need to determine the angle \( \theta \). The value \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a specific cosine value, and we can use the fact that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of the quadratic equation derived from the original equation. The quadratic equation is:

\[ 2z^2 - (1 + \sqrt{5})z + 2 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{(1 + \sqrt{5})^2 - 16}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

However, we can use the fact that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a known value, and we can use the periodicity of the cosine function. The angle \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), and we need to find \( \cos 85\theta \). Since \( \cos \theta \) is a specific value, we can use the fact that the cosine function is periodic with period \( 2\pi \). Therefore, \( 85\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) will give us the equivalent angle whose cosine we can find.

Given the specific value of \( \cos \theta \), we can use the fact that \( \cos 85\theta = \cos (85\theta \mod 2\pi) \). Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a specific value, we can use the fact that the cosine function is periodic and the specific value of \( \cos 85\theta \) will be the same as \( \cos \theta \) due to the periodicity and the specific value of \( \cos \theta \).

Therefore, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \cos \theta = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of triangle \( \triangle AGH \) given that the area of triangle \( \triangle ABC \) is 144. We will use properties of the centroid and the fact that the lines \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) are concurrent at the centroid \( G \).

1. **Centroid Properties**:
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( G \) is located at \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Area Division by Medians**:
   The medians of a triangle divide it into six smaller triangles of equal area. Since the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, each of these smaller triangles has an area of:
   \[
   \frac{144}{6} = 24
   \]

3. **Position of \( H \)**:
   The point \( H \) is the intersection of the lines \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) extended, which is the centroid \( G \) of \( \triangle ABC \).

4. **Area of \( \triangle AGH \)**:
   Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AGH \) is one-third of the area of \( \triangle AGB \).

5. **Area of \( \triangle AGB \)**:
   The area of \( \triangle AGB \) is half the area of \( \triangle ABC \) because the medians divide the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area, and \( \triangle AGB \) consists of two of these smaller triangles:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGB = \frac{144}{2} = 72
   \]

6. **Area of \( \triangle AGH \)**:
   Since \( G \) is the centroid, the area of \( \triangle AGH \) is one-third of the area of \( \triangle AGB \):
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGH = \frac{72}{3} = 24

We are given that the 4th term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the 8th term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:
\[ a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200, \]
\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500. \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200,\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500.\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200, \]
\[ 4d = 300, \]
\[ d = 75. \]

\[ a_1 = 200 - 225, \]
\[ a_1 = -25. \]

1. **Identify the possible numbers on the dot cards:**
   The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. Among these, 2 is the only even prime number, and the rest (3, 5, 7, 11, 13) are odd.

2. **Determine the possible outcomes:**

3. **Count the favorable outcomes:**
   - If Paul writes the even number 2, Jesse must also write an even number. However, there are no other even numbers among the first six primes, so this scenario is not possible.
   - If Paul writes one of the odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13), Jesse must also write an odd number. There are 5 odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) favorable outcomes.

   There are 10 perfect squares in this range.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability \( P \) of selecting a perfect square from the range 1 to 100 is the ratio of the number of perfect squares to the total number of house numbers.
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of perfect squares}}{\text{Total number of house numbers}} = \frac{10}{100} = \frac{1}{10}

"To determine the sum of the digits of the number \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) in its decimal form, we first need to simplify the expression.

First, let's rewrite the denominator in a more convenient form:
\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2.\]
So the expression becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot 10^{-7} = 0.0000021605.\]

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

This simplifies to:
\[

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for the product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

"A given equation in cylindrical coordinates is \( z = c \). To understand what this equation represents, let's recall the relationship between cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) and Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\). The conversion formulas are:

\[ y = r \sin \theta \]
\[ z = z \]

In the equation \( z = c \), the value of \( z \) is constant. This means that for any point \((r, \theta, z)\) on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \). The values of \( r \) and \( \theta \) can vary, which means that the points can be at different distances from the \( z \)-axis and at different angles, but they will all lie on a plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and located at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the equation \( z = c \) represents a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, substituting the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product, we get:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying this equation, we find:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \).

The function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \) is a horizontal shift of \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. This means that if \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is equal to the coefficient of \( x^2 \) with the opposite sign, which is 49. Therefore, we have:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49. \]

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean identity for secant and tangent:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity to \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]

Now, we need to handle \(\csc^2 20^\circ\) and \(\csc^2 40^\circ\). Recall the identity for the cosecant function:
\[
\csc^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\sin^2 \theta}
\]
We can use the double-angle identity for sine:
\[
\sin 2\theta = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\sin^2 2\theta = 4 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta
\]
Thus,
\[
\csc^2 2\theta = \frac{1}{\sin^2 2\theta} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta}
\]
For \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

Similarly, for \(\theta = 40^\circ\), we have:
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 40^\circ \cos^2 40^\circ}
\]

Now, we need to find a common approach to simplify the sum. Notice that:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}
\]

We can use the identity:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]
For \(\theta = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} = 3 \sin 10^\circ - 4 \sin^3 10^\circ
\]
Solving for \(\sin 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = 3 \sin 10^\circ - 4 \sin^3 10^\circ
\]
Let \(x = \sin 10^\circ\). Then:
\[
4x^3 - 3x + \frac{1}{2} = 0

We can use the triple-angle identity for sine:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]
For \(\theta = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} = 3 \sin 10^\circ - 4 \sin^3 10^\circ
\]
Solving for \(\sin 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = 3 \sin 10^\circ - 4 \sin^3 10^\circ
\]
Let \(x = \sin 10^\circ\). Then:
\[
4x^3 - 3x + \frac{1}{2} = 0
\]

Finally, we use the identity:
\[
\sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta
\]
For \(\theta = 10^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 30^\circ = \frac{1}{2} = 3 \sin 10^\circ - 4 \sin^3 10^\circ

Let \(x = \sin 10^\circ\). Then:

"To determine the number of sides of the convex polygon, we start by recalling a fundamental property of polygons: the sum of the exterior angles of any convex polygon is always \(360^\circ\). This property holds regardless of the number of sides of the polygon.

Given that the sum of all the interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the fact that the sum of all the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
\[

Let's denote the measure of the missing interior angle by \(x\). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is:

"To solve for the number \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to find \( t \) such that:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We need to solve this quadratic congruence. First, we use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

So, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution, and thus \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Both values satisfy the condition, but we need to choose one. The problem does not specify which one to choose, so we can choose either. For the sake of this solution, we will choose \( t = 4 \).

1. **Find the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:

   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic meter, we can set up the equation:

"To find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse trigonometric functions. Specifically, we know that for any non-zero real number \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we start by identifying the direction vectors of the lines and a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line.

The first line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

The second line is given by:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Notice that \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1}\), so the lines are indeed parallel. We can use the vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. Let's use the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The vector connecting these points is:

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines is given by the formula:
\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\|}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\|}.

First, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\|\mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

This tetrahedron is actually a rectangle in the \(xy\)-plane with a height of 8 units along the \(z\)-axis, but since we are only considering the \(xy\)-plane, we can ignore the \(z\)-coordinate for now.

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) and has a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units. We need to find all integer coordinate points \((x,y)\) that lie within this rectangle. The \(x\)-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\) and the \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}
\]

We are given the following cross products:

\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

Substituting the given values, we get:

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[

\[

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of the trapezoid \([ABCD] = 42\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the segments as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(AB = c\)
- \(CD = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the Angle Bisector Theorem, which states that the angle bisector divides the opposite side into segments proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{c}{a} = \frac{b}{d}
\]

Next, since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD
\]

To find \(AC\) and \(CD\), we need to use the area of the trapezoid. The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = 42
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is the same as \(AC\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42 \implies (a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(h = AC\), we can express the area of \(\triangle ACD\) as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times CD
\]

From the right triangle \(\triangle ACD\), we know that \(CD = d\). However, we need to find a relationship between \(h\) and \(d\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). But since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), we can directly use the area of the trapezoid to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

Given that the area of the trapezoid is 42 and \(\overline{AC}\) is the height, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) is the height and it splits the trapezoid into two triangles of equal height. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the probability that two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. For two chords to intersect, the endpoints of one chord must alternate with the endpoints of the other chord when traversing the circle. That is, if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, the points must appear in an alternating pattern such as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

2. **Counting the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of distinct cyclic permutations of 4 points, which is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\). This is because in a cyclic arrangement, one point can be fixed to break the symmetry, and the remaining 3 points can be arranged in \(3!\) ways.

3. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points alternate, i.e., \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Any other arrangement will result in the chords not intersecting.

4. **Calculating the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes. Therefore, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:
   \[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the smaller circle. Let's denote the centers of the smaller and larger circles as \(O_1\) and \(O_2\) respectively, with radii \(1\) and \(2\). The points of tangency are \(A\) and \(B\), and the points where the tangents meet the line segment \(O_1O_2\) are \(D\) and \(E\) respectively.

Given that the area of the triangle \(ADC\) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we can start by calculating the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi.
\]
Thus, the area of triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ADC = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}.
\]

Since \(AD\) and \(CD\) are radii of the smaller circle, \(AD = CD = 1\). The distance \(O_1O_2\) is the sum of the radii of the two circles, which is \(1 + 2 = 3\). The distance \(O_1D\) is the radius of the smaller circle, which is \(1\), and the distance \(O_2D\) is the radius of the larger circle minus the radius of the smaller circle, which is \(2 - 1 = 1\).

The triangle \(ADC\) is isosceles with \(AD = CD = 1\). The height from \(D\) to \(AC\) is the perpendicular distance from \(D\) to the line segment \(AC\), which is the same as the distance from \(O_1\) to \(O_2\) minus the radius of the smaller circle, which is \(2 - 1 = 1\).

The area of triangle \(ADC\) can also be calculated using the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times 1 = \frac{AC}{2}.
\]
Setting this equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), we get:
\[
\frac{AC}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} \implies AC = \frac{10\pi}{3}.
\]

However, we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\). Since \(AD\) and \(CD\) are radii of the smaller circle, the triangle \(ADC\) is isosceles with \(AD = CD = 1\). The angle \(\angle ADC\) can be found using the cosine rule in triangle \(ADC\):
\[
AC^2 = AD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot AD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle ADC).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{10\pi}{3}\right)^2 = 1^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot \cos(\angle ADC) \implies \frac{100\pi^2}{9} = 2 - 2 \cos(\angle ADC) \implies \cos(\angle ADC) = 1 - \frac{50\pi^2}{9}.
\]

However, we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. Since the problem is asking for the measure of the angle, we can use the fact that the angle \(\angle ADC\) is a right angle, which is \(90^\circ\).

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[

We use the difference of squares formula:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9

"To determine how much more speed the character has per more seconds, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial speed of the character. The character initially has a speed of 20 meters per second.
2. Determine the increase in speed. The character's speed increases by 5 meters per second per second.
3. Calculate the new speed after 2 seconds. The new speed is the initial speed plus the increase in speed over the 2 seconds.

Let's do the calculations step by step:

1. Initial speed = 20 meters per second.
2. Increase in speed per second = 5 meters per second per second.
3. Increase in speed after 2 seconds = 5 meters per second per second * 2 seconds = 10 meters per second.
4. New speed after 2 seconds = Initial speed + Increase in speed after 2 seconds = 20 meters per second + 10 meters per second = 30 meters per second.

So, the character's speed after 2 seconds is 30 meters per second. The increase in speed per more second is 5 meters per second.

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member group from 8 repub like and 6 der unit, such that at least one member is from both groups, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a 5-member group and then subtracting the number of ways to form a 5-member group that does not meet the condition (i.e., a group with all members from either the repub like or the der unit).

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member group from 14 members:**

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3

This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096

Now, solve the quadratic equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\). Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[

Solve these two equations separately:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 66

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as:

This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \). Let \( D \) be a point on \( AM \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \). We need to find the area of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( AM \) is the altitude, \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), and \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}. \]

Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}. \]
Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}. \]

Using the triple angle identity for sine, \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \), and the half-angle identity, \( \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) \), we get:
\[ \frac{2x}{3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta} = \frac{BD}{\cos \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)}. \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle. Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), we can use the fact that the altitude splits the isosceles triangle into two right triangles. The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[ \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AM = \frac{1}{2} \times 2x \times 11 = 11x. \]

To find \( x \), we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle. Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BAC = \theta \), we can use the fact that the altitude splits the isosceles triangle into two right triangles. The length of \( BC \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ BC = 2x = 2 \sqrt{121 + x^2 - 100} = 2 \sqrt{21 + x^2}. \]

Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BAC = \theta \), we can use the fact that the altitude splits the isosceles triangle into two right triangles. The length of \( BC \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ BC = 2x = 2 \sqrt{121 + x^2 - 100} = 2 \sqrt{21 + x^2}. \]

"To solve the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we need to analyze the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) and determine the range of values for \( x \) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's consider the expression \( x^4 + 4x^2 \). Notice that \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) is always non-negative because it is a sum of squares. Specifically, we can rewrite it as:
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 4). \]
Since \( x^2 \geq 0 \) for all real \( x \), and \( x^2 + 4 \geq 4 \) for all real \( x \), it follows that \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \).

Now, let's find the minimum value of \( x^4 + 4x^2 \). The minimum value occurs when \( x = 0 \):
\[ x^4 + 4x^2 = 0^4 + 4 \cdot 0^2 = 0. \]
So, the minimum value of \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) is 0.

Next, we need to find the maximum value of \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) that is less than 21. To do this, we solve the equation \( x^4 + 4x^2 = 21 \). Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the equation becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0. \]
This is a quadratic equation, and we can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7. \]
Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard the negative solution. Therefore, \( y = 3 \), which means \( x^2 = 3 \) or \( x = \pm \sqrt{3} \).

So, the maximum value of \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) that is less than 21 is 21, and it is achieved when \( x = \pm \sqrt{3} \).

Combining these results, we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^4 + 4x^2 < 21. \]
This means that \( x \) can be any real number such that \( -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \).

\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) into the identity, we get:

\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[

Substituting this into the identity, we get:

\]
We also know from the third equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12,

which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.

sp = 24.

s = \frac{24}{p}.

which simplifies to:
\[

  \[
  \frac{B_1}{B_2} = \frac{4554.4}{3418.4} \approx 1.332

Now, we compare the ratios:
- For the 9thévolyam: \( \frac{B_1}{B_2} \approx 1.048 \)
- For the 10thévolyam: \( \frac{B_1}{B_2} \approx 1.033 \)

The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[0 < x < 36\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the trapezoid inscribed in a circle with a perimeter of 400 meters, we start by noting that the trapezoid is an isosceles trapezoid because it is inscribed in a circle. This means that the non-parallel sides are equal in length.

Let the lengths of the parallel sides be \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(a > b\)), and the length of each non-parallel side be \(c\). The perimeter of the trapezoid is given by:
\[a + b + 2c = 400.\]

Since the trapezoid is cyclic, the sum of the lengths of the opposite sides is equal. Therefore, we have:
\[a + b = 2c.\]

We can solve for \(c\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[c = \frac{a + b}{2}.\]

Substituting \(c\) into the perimeter equation, we get:
\[a + b + 2\left(\frac{a + b}{2}\right) = 400,\]
\[a + b + a + b = 400,\]
\[2a + 2b = 400,\]
\[a + b = 200.\]

Now, we need to find the area of the trapezoid. The area \(A\) of a trapezoid is given by:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h,\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid. Since \(a + b = 200\), the area becomes:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \times 200 \times h = 100h.\]

To find the height \(h\), we use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, half the difference of the parallel sides, and the non-parallel side. The height \(h\) can be found using the formula for the height of an isosceles trapezoid:
\[h = \sqrt{c^2 - \left(\frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2}.\]

Since \(c = \frac{a + b}{2} = 100\), we have:
\[h = \sqrt{100^2 - \left(\frac{a - b}{2}\right)^2}.\]

To maximize the area, we need to maximize \(h\). The maximum value of \(h\) occurs when \(a\) and \(b\) are as close as possible to each other, but since \(a\) and \(b\) are not equal (otherwise it would be a rectangle), we consider the case where \(a\) and \(b\) are as close as possible while still being different. The maximum height occurs when \(a\) and \(b\) are as close as possible, which is when \(a\) and \(b\) are 101 and 99 respectively (or vice versa).

Substituting \(a = 101\) and \(b = 99\) into the height formula, we get:
\[h = \sqrt{100^2 - \left(\frac{101 - 99}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{100^2 - 1^2} = \sqrt{10000 - 1} = \sqrt{9999}.\]

Therefore, the area \(A\) is:
\[A = 100 \times \sqrt{9999}.\]

However, we need to find the largest possible area in square meters, and the correct approach is to consider the case where the trapezoid is a rectangle (which is a special case of an isosceles trapezoid). In this case, the trapezoid becomes a rectangle with \(a = b = 100\) and \(c = 100\), and the height is 100 meters.

Thus, the area of the rectangle is:
\[A = 100 \times 100 = 10000 \text{ square meters}.\]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the trapezoid is:

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by understanding the given information and the properties of right triangles.

Given:
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\).
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\).

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, for \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that the side opposite to \(\angle R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Next, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Since \(\angle T\) is the other non-right angle in the triangle, it is complementary to \(\angle R\). Therefore, \(\angle T = 90^\circ - \angle R\).

Using the complementary angle identity for sine and cosine:
\[
\sin{T} = \sin{(90^\circ - R)} = \cos{R}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\cos{R}\). The cosine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the adjacent side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\):
\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

We already know the hypotenuse is 5 units. To find the adjacent side, we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{hypotenuse}^2 = \text{opposite}^2 + \text{adjacent}^2
\]
\[
5^2 = 2^2 + \text{adjacent}^2
\]
\[
25 = 4 + \text{adjacent}^2
\]
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 = 21
\]
\[
\text{adjacent} = \sqrt{21}
\]

Thus, \(\cos{R}\) is:
\[
\cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Therefore, \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\sin{T} = \cos{R} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the distance between the point \((1, 0)\) and the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\). The distance between a point \((x_1, y_1)\) and a point \((x_2, y_2)\) on the graph is given by the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

Here, the point \((x_1, y_1) = (1, 0)\) and the point \((x_2, y_2) = (x, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3))\). Substituting these into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) - 0\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding the terms inside the square root, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 - 2x + 1 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 - 2x + \frac{11}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum distance, we need to minimize the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 - 2x + \frac{11}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x - 2
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[
2x^3 - 4x - 2 = 0 \implies x^3 - 2x - 1 = 0
\]

We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \(x = -1\), we get:

\[
(-1)^3 - 2(-1) - 1 = -1 + 2 - 1 = 0
\]

So, \(x = -1\) is a root. We can factor \(x^3 - 2x - 1\) as \((x + 1)(x^2 - x - 1)\). The quadratic \(x^2 - x - 1\) has roots \(\frac{1 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}\). We need to check which of these roots gives the minimum distance. We substitute \(x = -1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{(-1 - 1)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}((-1)^2 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{(-2)^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1 - 3)\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-2)\right)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 2} = \sqrt{6}
\]

Thus, the distance is \(\sqrt{6}\), which can be written as \(\frac{\sqrt{24}}{2}\). Here, \(a = 24\) and \(b = 2\), and \(a\) is not a prime number and cannot be expressed as a product of two prime numbers. Therefore, \(a + b = 24 + 2 = 26\).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the function \( f(x) \) separately.

### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( x \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we have \( x = -1 \). However, \( x = -1 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \) either. Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

From the above cases, we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Let's test \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2(4^2) + 3(4) = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \quad (\text{not } 6)
   \]
   Let's test \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   -5^3 + 2(5^2) + 3(5) = -125 + 50 + 15 = -60 \quad (\text{not } 6)
   \]
   Since the cubic equation does not yield simple solutions and the function is continuous and differentiable, we can conclude that there are no simple solutions in this case.

From the above cases, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Final Answer
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

Thus, the final answer is:

"To determine the distance from the point \( P \) to the sixth face of the cube, we first need to understand the geometry of the problem. The point \( P \) is equidistant from the vertices of the cube, and the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth face of the cube.

Let's denote the side length of the cube as \( a \). The coordinates of the vertices of the cube can be represented in a coordinate system where the cube is centered at the origin. For simplicity, let's assume the cube is aligned with the coordinate axes and the center of the cube is at the origin. The vertices of the cube can be represented as \( (\pm a/2, \pm a/2, \pm a/2) \).

The distance from a point \( P = (x, y, z) \) to a face of the cube is simply the absolute value of the coordinate of the point that is perpendicular to the face. For example, the distance from \( P \) to the face \( x = a/2 \) is \( |x - a/2| \), and the distance from \( P \) to the face \( x = -a/2 \) is \( |x + a/2| \).

Since the distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a cube to the faces of the cube is constant and equal to \( 3a^2 \). This is a known geometric property of cubes.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we can denote the unknown distance to the sixth face as \( d \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the faces of the cube is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2 = 3a^2 \]
Calculating the left side, we get:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d^2 = 3a^2 \]
\[ 324 + d^2 = 3a^2 \]
Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a cube to the faces of the cube is \( 3a^2 \), we can solve for \( d \) by noting that the sum of the squares of the given distances plus \( d^2 \) must equal \( 3a^2 \). The value of \( d \) must be such that the equation holds true.

By trial and error or by solving the equation, we find that \( d = 5 \) satisfies the equation:
\[ 324 + 25 = 349 \]
\[ 3a^2 = 349 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the ratio of the angular speed of Jack's baseball to the angular speed of the softball. The angular speed is related to the linear speed and the radius of the circular path. Since the linear speed of the softball and the baseball are the same (because they are moving in a circle of the same radius), the angular speed of the baseball will be greater than that of the softball because the baseball has a smaller mass.

The relationship between linear speed \(v\), angular speed \(\omega\), and radius \(r\) is given by:
\[ v = \omega r \]

Since the linear speed \(v\) is the same for both the softball and the baseball, we can write:
\[ v = \omega_{\text{softball}} r = \omega_{\text{baseball}} r \]

This simplifies to:
\[ \omega_{\text{softball}} = \omega_{\text{baseball}} \]

However, the angular speed is inversely proportional to the moment of inertia \(I\). The moment of inertia for a point mass is given by:
\[ I = mr^2 \]

So, the angular speed is inversely proportional to the mass \(m\):
\[ \omega \propto \frac{1}{m} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the angular speeds of the baseball to the softball is:
\[ \frac{\omega_{\text{baseball}}}{\omega_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{m_{\text{softball}}}{m_{\text{baseball}}} \]

Given that the mass of the softball is 200 g and the mass of the baseball is 150 g, we can substitute these values into the equation:
\[ \frac{\omega_{\text{baseball}}}{\omega_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{200}{150} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Thus, the ratio of the angular speed of Jack's baseball to the angular speed of the softball is:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we start by substituting \( x-1 \) into \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we need to expand each term in \( g(x) \).

First, expand \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

Next, expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

Now, expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is obtained by evaluating \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15 = 2. \]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form of the line is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. That is,

\[ S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \]
\[ S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \]
\[ S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3. \]

We know that the sum of all possible products of the roots taken two at a time is zero, i.e.,

\[ \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0. \]

This can be rewritten as

\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0. \]

Next, we need to find the product of these expressions. The product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) can be expressed in terms of the roots of the polynomial. Notice that

\[ S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3). \]

Using the identity for the product of sums of products of roots, we have

\[ S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 2 \cdot (-2) = -4. \]

Now, we need to find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) that satisfy both \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\). The possible values for \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + 4 = 0\), which are \(t = -\sqrt[3]{4}\), \(t = -\sqrt[3]{4} \omega\), and \(t = -\sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. Therefore, the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are \(-\sqrt[3]{4}\), \(-\sqrt[3]{4} \omega\), and \(-\sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2\).

Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{-\sqrt[3]{4}, -\sqrt[3]{4} \omega, -\sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2\}\).

"To determine how much money a specific person has in cents, we need to convert the dollar amounts into cents. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 cents, we can convert the amounts as follows:

1. Forácszintes: \$1.24
   \[
   1.24 \text{ dollars} = 1.24 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 124 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. Forácszintes: \$1.82
   \[
   1.82 \text{ dollars} = 1.82 \times 100 \text{ cents} = 182 \text{ cents}
   \]

Since the problem states that the amounts do not include the coins, we can conclude that the amounts given are the total cents for each person. Therefore, if we are asked how much money a specific person has, we can directly use the given amounts in cents.

For example, if we are asked how much money a specific person has, and we know that person has \$1.24, then the amount in cents is:
\[
1.24 \text{ dollars} = 124 \text{ cents}
\]

If we are asked how much money a specific person has, and we know that person has \$1.82, then the amount in cents is:
\[
1.82 \text{ dollars} = 182 \text{ cents}
\]

Since the problem does not specify which person we are referring to, we can only provide the conversion for each amount. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the conversion of \$1.24, the answer would be:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the tetrahedron \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four faces of the tetrahedron.

First, let's understand the geometry of the problem. The center \(O\) of the tetrahedron is equidistant from all four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The distance from \(O\) to any face of the tetrahedron is the same, and this distance is the radius of the inscribed sphere of the tetrahedron.

The volume of the tetrahedron can be divided into four smaller tetrahedra by drawing lines from \(O\) to each of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). Each of these smaller tetrahedra has \(O\) as its apex and one of the faces of the original tetrahedron as its base. The volume of each of these smaller tetrahedra is proportional to the distance from \(O\) to the corresponding face.

Since the distance from \(O\) to each face is the same, the volumes of the four smaller tetrahedra are equal. Therefore, the volume of the region closer to \(O\) than to any face is the volume of one of these smaller tetrahedra, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the total volume of the tetrahedron.

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the tetrahedron is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four faces is \(\frac{1}{4}\).

\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ha } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ha } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.0472 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

First, let's add the cents (the decimal part) step by step:

\[
0.47 + 0.23 + 0.37 + 0.52 = 1.59
\]

Next, let's add the dollars (the whole number part) step by step:

27 + 35 + 37 + 26 = 125

Now, we combine the dollars and the cents:

\[
125 + 1.59 = 126.59

So, the total amount of money they have together is \$126.59. Since the problem asks for the amount in pence (the smallest unit of currency), we convert \$126.59 to pence. There are 100 pence in a dollar, so:

2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score of all students. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80 points each.
- 8 students scored 90 points each.
- 2 students scored 100 points each.

The total score from the students who scored 80 points is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The total score from the students who scored 90 points is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The total score from the students who scored 100 points is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total score of all students:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score. The total number of students is:
\[ 20 + 8 + 2 = 30 \]

So, the average score is:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals of the 4x4 grid is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals are all equal.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = 4n + 3
\]
So, \( S = 4n + 3 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 2 + (n-1) = 4n - 6
\]
Since the sum of each row must be the same, we set the two expressions for \( S \) equal to each other:
\[
4n + 3 = 4n - 6
\]
This equation is clearly not possible unless there is an error in the problem setup or interpretation. However, let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the constraints on the grid.

The sum of the second column is:
\[

\]
The sum of the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + (n+1) + (n-3) = 4n - 9

Since all these sums must be equal to \( S = 4n + 3 \), we can set up the following equations:
\[
4n + 3 = 2n - 1 \implies 2n = -4 \implies n = -2
\]
\[
4n + 3 = 2n - 6 \implies 2n = -9 \implies n = -\frac{9}{2}

\[
4n + 3 = n + 3 \implies 3n = 0 \implies n = 0

\[
4n + 3 = 2n + 1 \implies 2n = -2 \implies n = -1

\[
4n + 3 = 4n - 11 \implies 3 = -11 \text{ (contradiction)}

\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160,000 + 90,000} = \sqrt{250,000} = 500 \text{ cm}
\]
Martha scribes the cake along this diagonal, which is 500 cm long. Since the cake is 300 cm high and 400 cm wide, Martha will scribe the cake into a grid of 500 pieces along the diagonal. The total number of pieces Martha eats is:
\[
500
\]

Now, we find the difference between the number of pieces Jim eats and the number of pieces Martha eats:
\[
120,000 - 500 = 119,500
\]

Therefore, Jim eats \(\boxed{119500}\) more pieces of cake than Martha.","[119500, '119500']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation are \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the relations \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator. We use the identity \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance from point \(D\) to the line segment \(AB\), we need to find the perpendicular distance from point \(D\) to the line passing through points \(A\) and \(B\).

First, let's find the equation of the line passing through points \(A\) and \(B\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \((-3, 3)\) and the coordinates of \(B\) are \((3, 0)\).

The slope \(m\) of the line \(AB\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{0 - 3}{3 - (-3)} = \frac{-3}{6} = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), we can write the equation of the line \(AB\) using point \(A\):
\[
y - 3 = -\frac{1}{2}(x + 3)
\]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[
y - 3 = -\frac{1}{2}x - \frac{3}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the perpendicular distance from point \(D\) to this line. The coordinates of \(D\) are \((0, 0)\). The formula for the perpendicular distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we rewrite the line equation \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + \frac{3}{2}\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):
\[
\frac{1}{2}x + y - \frac{3}{2} = 0
\]
Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
x + 2y - 3 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 1\), \(B = 2\), and \(C = -3\). Substituting the coordinates of \(D\) \((0, 0)\) into the distance formula, we get:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|1(0) + 2(0) - 3|}{\sqrt{1^2 + 2^2}} = \frac{|-3|}{\sqrt{1 + 4}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}
\]

Thus, the shortest distance from point \(D\) to the line segment \(AB\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{3\sqrt{5}}{5}}
