"To determine the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We know that:
- \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \) (since it is a right angle).
- \( \sin D = 0.7 \).
- \( EF = 7 \).

Since \( \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \), we can identify the opposite side to \( \angle D \) as \( EF \) and the hypotenuse as \( DE \). Therefore, we have:
\[ \sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7. \]

To find \( DE \), we solve the equation:
\[ \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7. \]

Multiplying both sides by \( DE \) gives:
\[ 7 = 0.7 \cdot DE. \]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[ DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10. \]

Thus, the length of \( DE \) is:
\[ \boxed{10}. \]","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To solve for \( w \), we need to add the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) to the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) after rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \).

First, let's express \( z \) in the form \( a + bi \):
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i. \]
So, \( a = 2 + \sqrt{2} \) and \( b = -(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) \).

Next, we need to rotate \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \). To do this, we first translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin, then rotate, and finally translate back. The translation is done by subtracting \( c \) from \( z \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (2 - 3i)) - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i = \sqrt{2} + 3i - 3 - 3\sqrt{2}i = (\sqrt{2} - 3) + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i. \]

Now, we rotate this vector by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise. The rotation matrix for \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) is:
\[ \begin{pmatrix} \cos \frac{\pi}{4} & -\sin \frac{\pi}{4} \\ \sin \frac{\pi}{4} & \cos \frac{\pi}{4} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix}. \]
Applying this rotation matrix to the vector \( (\sqrt{2} - 3) + (3 - 3\sqrt{2})i \), we get:
\[ \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} & \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{2} - 3 \\ 3 - 3\sqrt{2} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\sqrt{2} - 3) - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2}) \\ \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(\sqrt{2} - 3) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}(3 - 3\sqrt{2}) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{2 - 3\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2} + 6}{2} \\ \frac{2 - 3\sqrt{2} + 3\sqrt{2} - 6}{2} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \frac{8 - 6\sqrt{2}}{2} \\ \frac{-4}{2} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 - 3\sqrt{2} \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}. \]

Now, we need to translate this back by adding \( c \):
\[ w = (4 - 3\sqrt{2}) + (-2)i + (2 - 3i) = (4 - 3\sqrt{2} + 2) + (-2 - 3)i = (6 - 3\sqrt{2}) - 5i. \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize the number 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

First, let's find the prime factorization of 242:
1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number). Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]
2. Now, we need to factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. Next, we check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. Next, we check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Next, we check if it is divisible by 7, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

Now, we can simplify the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}

"To determine the number of ways 8 pieces of cake can sit at a table if 3 specific pieces (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of 3 pieces as a single ""super piece"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""super piece"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""pieces"" (the ""super piece"" and the other 5 pieces of cake).

2. **Arrange the 6 ""pieces"" around the table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""pieces"" is:
   \[

3. **Arrange the 3 pieces within the ""super piece"":**
   Within the ""super piece"", Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 pieces is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements:**
   Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""pieces"" by the number of ways to arrange the 3 pieces within the ""super piece"":

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the powers of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the general term becomes:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k} x^{-2k}
\]

Simplify the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

Simplify each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
x^{15-5(3)} = x^0 = 1
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} \times 1 = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \times -12.5 = -125

"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). This means that \( n \) can be written in the form \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \). We need to find the remainder when the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 2)(7k + 2 + 4)(7k + 2 + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]
Next, we reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]
So, the expression simplifies to:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.
\]
Now, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24.

We need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3,
\]
so
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}.

"To determine the minimum number of grades needed for the Fincus to ensure its position is complete, we need to understand the structure of the Fincus and the game's rules. The Fincus is a geometric shape with a specific number of sides, and the game involves rolling the Fincus on a board with a grid of squares. The Fincus can only move to adjacent squares, and it must cover all the squares in its row or column to be considered complete.

The Fincus is a hexagon, which has 6 sides. When the Fincus is placed on a hexagon, it can move to any of the 6 adjacent squares. To cover all the squares in its row or column, the Fincus must move to each of the 6 squares in its row or column. Therefore, the Fincus needs to make 6 moves to cover all the squares in its row or column.

Since the Fincus can only move to adjacent squares, it must make at least 6 moves to ensure that it has covered all the squares in its row or column. Therefore, the minimum number of grades needed for the Fincus to ensure its position is complete is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). Now, we need to find the value of \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 6 + (-1) = 5
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",17,"[17, '17']",False

"为了找到函数 \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) 的垂直和水平渐近线，我们需要分析分母和分子的行为。

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
这个二次方程可以分解为：

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\).

Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\]

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we use the fact that \(z^5 = 1\) to express \(\frac{1}{z}\) and \(\frac{1}{z^2}\) in terms of \(z\):

\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

Now, we can combine the fractions:

   - Therefore, the total value of the score is \(9 + 1 = 10\) tree-kings.

3. Determine the value of the score in terms of the shapes of the other trees:

   - The value of 2 triangles is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) tree-kings.
   - The value of 1 circle is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) tree-king.
   - Therefore, the total value of the score is \(4 + 1 = 5\) tree-kings.

"为了找到 \(a\) 和 \(b\) 的值，使得多项式 \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) 和 \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) 的乘积等于 \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\)，我们需要展开两个多项式的乘积，并将其与给定的多项式进行比较。

首先，让我们展开 \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\)：

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

展开每一项，我们得到：

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a

现在，让我们将所有这些项组合在一起：

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

我们知道这个表达式必须等于 \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\)。因此，我们可以将相应项的系数相等：

1. \(t^4\) 的系数：\(12 = 12\)
2. \(t^3\) 的系数：\(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) 的系数：\(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) 的系数：\(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. 常数项：\(-2a = 6\)

从常数项，我们可以解出 \(a\)：

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

现在将 \(a = -3\) 代入 \(t^3\) 的系数方程：

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

接下来，我们将 \(a = -3\) 和 \(b = 2\) 代入 \(t^2\) 的系数方程进行验证：

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

这是正确的。最后，我们将 \(a = -3\) 和 \(b = 2\) 代入 \(t\) 的系数方程：

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

这也是正确的。因此，\(a\) 和 \(b\) 的值是正确的。\(a + b\) 的值是：

\[

"To determine the radius of the tank, we need to understand the relationship between the volume of water added per rotation and the dimensions of the tank.

1. **Identify the volume of water added per rotation:**
   The volume of water added per rotation is given as \(20\pi\) cubic meters.

2. **Identify the dimensions of the tank:**
   The tank is cylindrical with a height equal to the distance the offside moves in one rotation, which is 4 meters. The radius of the tank is what we need to find.

3. **Volume of a cylinder formula:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

4. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**
   Here, the volume \(V\) is \(20\pi\) cubic meters and the height \(h\) is 4 meters. So we have:
   \[
   20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
   \]

5. **Solve for \(r^2\):**
   First, divide both sides of the equation by \(\pi\):
   \[
   20 = 4r^2
   \]
   Then, divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   5 = r^2
   \]

6. **Solve for \(r\):**

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of the function in each piece.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   \[
   f(x) = ax^2
   \]
   This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   \[
   f(x) = ax + 2a
   \]
   This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the function must be continuous and cover all possible \(y\)-values. This means that the function must take on all values from \(-\infty\) to \(\infty\).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Continuity at \(x = a\):**
   For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both must equal \(f(a)\).

   \[
   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a)
   \]

   Calculate the left-hand limit:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a
   \]

   Calculate the right-hand limit:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a(a)^2 = a^3
   \]

   Set the limits equal to each other:
   \[
   a^2 + 2a = a^3
   \]

   Rearrange the equation:
   \[
   a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0
   \]

   Factor out \(a\):
   \[
   a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0
   \]

   Solve the quadratic equation \(a^2 - a - 2 = 0\):
   \[
   a^2 - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1) = 0
   \]

   So, the solutions are:
   \[
   a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1
   \]

2. **Behavior of the function for each \(a\):**
   - For \(a = 0\):
     \[
     f(x) =
     \begin{cases}
     0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\
     0 & \text{if } x < 0.
     \end{cases}
     \]
     This is a constant function \(f(x) = 0\), which does not intersect every horizontal line.

   - For \(a = 2\):
     \[
     f(x) =
     \begin{cases}
     2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
     2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
     \end{cases}
     \]
     The function \(2x^2\) for \(x \geq 2\) covers all values from 8 to \(\infty\), and the function \(2x + 4\) for \(x < 2\) covers all values from \(-\infty\) to 8. Together, they cover all real numbers.

   - For \(a = -1\):
     \[
     f(x) =
     \begin{cases}
     -x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1,\\
     -x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1.
     \end{cases}
     \]
     The function \(-x^2\) for \(x \geq -1\) covers all values from \(-1\) to \(\infty\), and the function \(-x - 2\) for \(x < -1\) covers all values from \(-\infty\) to \(-1\). Together, they cover all real numbers.

### Conclusion:
The largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with a radius of 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
So, the fixed points of \(f\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (provided that \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \in [0,1]\), which is true for \(1 \le \lambda \le 4\)).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which satisfies the equation. If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there is a non fixed point \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to analyze the cubic equation. By the nature of the function and the requirement that \(f(x) \neq x\), we need to check the behavior of the function for different values of \(\lambda\).

By analyzing the function and the requirement that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\), we find that this condition is satisfied for \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2\), and we can check that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) for some \(x \in (0,1)\).

"To find the measure of the angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) is given by the expression

\[

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formulas, we can rewrite the terms involving products of cosines and sines. Notice that:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]

So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we can rewrite the terms involving products of sines and cosines. Notice that:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ.
\]

So the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We recognize that this is the tangent of a specific angle. By using the tangent addition formula, we can see that:

\[
\tan (45^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 45^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 45^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1 - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\cos 20^\circ - \sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

However, we need to match the form of our expression. Notice that:

\[
\tan (45^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan 25^\circ.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \tan 25^\circ,

"To determine the number of ways to label the foci of an ellipse, we need to understand the properties of an ellipse and the nature of its foci. An ellipse is defined by its two foci, which are points inside the ellipse that satisfy the property that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant.

Given an ellipse, there are exactly two foci, and these foci are distinct and fixed points. The problem asks for the number of ways to label these two foci. Since the foci are distinct, we can label them in two different ways: either as \(F_1\) and \(F_2\) or as \(F_2\) and \(F_1\).

Therefore, the number of ways to label the foci of an ellipse is simply the number of permutations of two distinct objects, which is \(2!\) (2 factorial).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum might occur at points where \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
Now, we need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \).

To find the critical points of \( g(x) \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We also need to check the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

Now, we evaluate \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]

Given \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we identify that \( z = \omega^2 \) or \( z = \omega^3 \) (since \( \omega^2 + \omega^3 = -1 - (\omega + \omega^4) = -1 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z \) is a fifth root of unity, \( z^5 = 1 \), and thus \( z^{85} = (z^5)^{17} = 1^{17} = 1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 1 + \frac{1}{1} = 1 + 1 = 2 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle \(ABC\). Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the properties of the incenter and the Gergonne point:**
   - The incenter \(G\) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect.
   - The Gergonne point is the point where the cevians (lines from the vertices to the opposite sides) intersect, and in this case, they are the angle bisectors \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\).

2. **Understand the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\):**
   - This line will intersect \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since it is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

3. **Determine the ratio of the areas of triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\):**
   - Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), the triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar with the same height from \(A\) to \(MN\) and from \(A\) to \(BC\). The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the segments of the corresponding sides.
   - The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) divides the triangle into two regions, and the smaller triangle \(AMN\) is similar to \(ABC\) with a ratio of similarity equal to the ratio of the segments of the sides. Since \(G\) is the incenter, the ratio of the sides of \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(1/2\). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \((1/2)^2 = 1/4\).

4. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AMN\):**
   - The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36\).

5. **Determine the area of triangle \(WAN\):**
   - The point \(W\) is the intersection of the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) and the angle bisector \(AD\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) divides the triangle into two regions, and the smaller triangle \(WAN\) is similar to \(AMN\) with the same ratio of similarity.
   - The area of triangle \(WAN\) is half the area of triangle \(AMN\) because the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) divides the triangle into two regions of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(WAN\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18\).

Thus, the area of triangle \(WAN\) is \(\boxed{18}\).","[18, '18']",8,"[8, '8']",True

"To determine the volume of the cone in cubic units, we start with the given formula for the volume of a cone:

"To determine how many positive integer factors the numbers 100 and 150 have, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - First, we find the prime factorization of 100.
     \[
     100 = 10 \times 10 = (2 \times 5) \times (2 \times 5) = 2^2 \times 5^2
     \]
   - Next, we find the prime factorization of 150.
     \[
     150 = 15 \times 10 = (3 \times 5) \times (2 \times 5) = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
     \]

2. **Counting the Factors**:
   - To find the number of positive integer factors of a number, we use the formula for the number of divisors. If a number \( n \) has a prime factorization of the form \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \), then the number of positive divisors of \( n \) is given by:
     \[
     (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
     \]

   - For the number 100:
     \[
     100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
     \]
     The exponents are 2 and 2. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is:
     \[
     (2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 3 \times 3 = 9

   - For the number 150:
     \[
     150 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^2

     The exponents are 1, 1, and 2. Therefore, the number of positive divisors is:
     \[
     (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The number of positive integer factors of 100 is 9.

"1. **Identify the given condition:**
   We need to find positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a \( n \)-th power of some integer.

2. **Express \( 2^{24} \) as a power of another integer:**
   We know that \( 2^{24} \) can be written as \( (2^k)^m \) where \( k \) and \( m \) are integers. This implies:
   \[
   2^{24} = (2^k)^m
   \]
   Since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, we can write:
   \[
   2^{24} = 2^{24}
   \]
   This is already in the form \( (2^k)^m \).

3. **Determine the possible values of \( n \):**
   For \( 2^{24} \) to be an \( n \)-th power, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24. This is because if \( 2^{24} = n^m \), then \( n \) must be of the form \( 2^a \) where \( a \) is an integer, and \( m \) must be such that \( 24 = am \).

4. **List the divisors of 24:**
   The divisors of 24 are:
   \[
   1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24
   \]
   Since \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list.

5. **Verify each divisor:**
   - For \( n = 2 \):
     \[
     2^{24} = (2^4)^6 = 16^6
     \]
   - For \( n = 3 \):
     \[
     2^{24} = (2^8)^3 = 256^3

   - For \( n = 4 \):
     \[

     \]
   - For \( n = 6 \):
     \[
     2^{24} = (2^4)^6 = 16^6

   - For \( n = 8 \):
     \[
     2^{24} = (2^3)^8 = 8^8

   The positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is an \( n \)-th power are:

4. **Identify the pairs with an even sum:**
   A sum is even if both numbers in the pair are either even or both are odd. From the list of pairs, the pairs with an even sum are:
   \[
   (2, 2), (3, 3), (3, 5), (5, 3), (5, 5)
   \]
   There are 5 such pairs.

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability \(P\) that the sum of the two numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
   \[
   P = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}} = \frac{5}{9}

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is \(\boxed{\frac{5}{9}}\).","[5/9, '\\frac{5}{9}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To determine the value of \( b \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation of the line.
2. Solve for \( b \).

The equation of the line is:
\[ 3x + 2y = 12 \]

Substituting \( x = 4 \) into the equation, we get:
\[ 3(4) + 2y = 12 \]

Simplify the left side of the equation:
\[ 12 + 2y = 12 \]

Next, isolate \( 2y \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 2y = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2y = 0 \]

Now, solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[ y = \frac{0}{2} \]
\[ y = 0 \]

"To determine the area of the region formed by the intersection of the two quadrilaterals, we start by analyzing the given diagram. The diagram shows two right triangles that share a common hypotenuse and intersect in a region. The vertices of the triangles are as follows:

1. The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

The intersection of these two triangles forms a smaller right triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((2, 2)\).

To find the area of this smaller right triangle, we use the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
In this case, the base and the height of the smaller triangle are both 2 units. Therefore, the area is:
\[

"To determine the largest number with the digits 0 and 1 that is a factor of 450, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We need a number composed only of the digits 0 and 1 that is a factor of 450. This means the number must be divisible by both 2 and 3 (since \(450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\)).

2. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0. Therefore, the number must end in 0.

3. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the number is composed only of 0s and 1s, the sum of its digits will be the number of 1s in the number.

4. **Form the number**: We need to find the largest number of the form \(111\ldots10\) that is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of this number is the number of 1s. We need this sum to be a multiple of 3.

5. **Check the largest possible numbers**:

   - For 110: The sum of the digits is 2 (not divisible by 3).
   - For 1110: The sum of the digits is 3 (divisible by 3).

Since 1110 is the largest number of the form \(111\ldots10\) that is divisible by 3, it is also divisible by 450.

Therefore, the largest number with the digits 0 and 1 that is a factor of 450 is \(\boxed{1110}\).","[1110, '1110']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False
"To determine the probability that the game piece is placed on the square with the number 12 on a standard 12-sided die, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem.

1. **First Condition**: The first number is obtained by dividing the die roll by 4, and the remainder must be 1, 2, or 3. This means the possible outcomes for the first number are 1, 2, and 3. The corresponding die rolls that satisfy this condition are:
   - If the first number is 1, the die roll must be 4 (since \(4 \div 4 = 1\) with a remainder of 0, but we need a remainder of 1, so this is not possible).
   - If the first number is 2, the die roll must be 8 (since \(8 \div 4 = 2\) with a remainder of 0, but we need a remainder of 2, so this is not possible).
   - If the first number is 3, the die roll must be 12 (since \(12 \div 4 = 3\) with a remainder of 0, but we need a remainder of 3, so this is not possible).

   Therefore, the only possible die roll that satisfies the first condition is 12.

2. **Second Condition**: The second number is obtained by dividing the die roll by 5, and the remainder must be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means the possible outcomes for the second number are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The corresponding die rolls that satisfy this condition are:
   - If the second number is 1, the die roll must be 6 (since \(6 \div 5 = 1\) with a remainder of 1).
   - If the second number is 2, the die roll must be 11 (since \(11 \div 5 = 2\) with a remainder of 1, but we need a remainder of 2, so this is not possible).
   - If the second number is 3, the die roll must be 10 (since \(10 \div 5 = 2\) with a remainder of 0, but we need a remainder of 3, so this is not possible).
   - If the second number is 4, the die roll must be 9 (since \(9 \div 5 = 1\) with a remainder of 4).

   Therefore, the only possible die roll that satisfies the second condition is 6.

Since the only die roll that satisfies both conditions is 12, the probability that the game piece is placed on the square with the number 12 is 1 (or 100%).

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the fraction.

First, we note that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This division gives us:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). To find the sum of the digits in this decimal, we add the digits of the number \(00021605\):
\[

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). So the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\cos 10^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines and cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

So the original expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

"To determine the form described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents geometrically.

In cylindrical coordinates, the coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\) are related to the Cartesian coordinates \((x, y, z)\) by the following transformations:
\[x = r \cos \theta,\]
\[y = r \sin \theta,\]
\[z = z.\]

The equation \(z = c\) means that the \(z\)-coordinate is a constant. In other words, for any point \((r, \theta, z)\) that satisfies this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\). This means that the points \((r, \theta, c)\) form a vertical line parallel to the \(r\)-\(\theta\) plane at a constant height \(z = c\).

Therefore, the equation \(z = c\) describes a vertical line in 3-dimensional space, which is also known as a line parallel to the \(z\)-axis.

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x+5) = 0 \).

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the angles of all its inscribed polygons is \(1070^\circ\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find the number of sides \(n\) of a polygon such that the sum of the interior angles and the sum of the angles of all its inscribed polygons equals \(1070^\circ\).

2. **Sum of interior angles of a polygon**: The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S_{\text{interior}} = 180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
   \]

3. **Sum of angles of all inscribed polygons**: An inscribed polygon is formed by connecting non-adjacent vertices of the original polygon. The number of inscribed polygons for a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the number of ways to choose 4 vertices out of \(n\) (since each inscribed polygon is a quadrilateral):
   \[
   \text{Number of inscribed polygons} = \binom{n}{4}
   \]
   The sum of the angles of each inscribed polygon is \(360^\circ\). Therefore, the total sum of the angles of all inscribed polygons is:
   \[
   S_{\text{inscribed}} = 360 \binom{n}{4}
   \]

4. **Total sum of angles**: The total sum of the angles of the polygon and all its inscribed polygons is:
   \[
   S_{\text{total}} = S_{\text{interior}} + S_{\text{inscribed}} = 180(n-2) + 360 \binom{n}{4}
   \]
   We are given that this total sum is \(1070^\circ\):
   \[
   180(n-2) + 360 \binom{n}{4} = 1070
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**: First, simplify the binomial coefficient:
   \[
   \binom{n}{4} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24}
   \]
   Substitute this into the equation:
   \[
   180(n-2) + 360 \cdot \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3)}{24} = 1070
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   180(n-2) + 15n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) = 1070

"To solve for a unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to find \( t \) that satisfies the equation:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]
We need to find the integer solutions to this quadratic congruence. First, we solve the quadratic equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By checking values, we find that \( 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( (-5)^2 = 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

This gives us two potential solutions for \( t \):
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
We need to check which of these values satisfy the original congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ 4(4 + 2) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ 17(17 + 2) = 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 17 \) is also a solution.

"To determine if the complete image of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter is enough to fit 1000 cubes with a volume of 1 cubic meter each, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine the side length of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter.
3. Calculate the volume of 1000 such cubes.
4. Compare the volume of 1000 cubes with the volume of the complete image of one cube.

Step 1: The side length of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter is:

Step 2: The side length of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter is the same as the side length of the cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter, which is 1 meter.

Step 3: The volume of 1000 such cubes is:

\[ \mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}. \]

接下来，我们找到叉积 \((\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1}) \times \mathbf{b}\)：
\[ \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2) \]

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly inside the given rectangular region, we first need to identify the boundaries of the rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are given as \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\). This means the rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\).

A point is strictly inside the rectangle if its \(x\)-coordinate is greater than \(-5\) and less than \(5\), and its \(y\)-coordinate is greater than \(-4\) and less than \(4\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\), which gives us 8 possible values.

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\). Therefore, we can substitute these values into our expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and then add the resulting vectors:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

\]
\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To solve for the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \), we start by analyzing the given information about trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), and \( \overline{AC} \) bisecting \( \angle BAD \). Additionally, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given as 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid from \(B\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \triangle ACD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).

Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), we can use the angle bisector theorem in \( \triangle ABD \). The angle bisector theorem states that the angle bisector of an angle in a triangle divides the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the adjacent sides. Therefore, if we let \(AC = d\), then the segments \(AB\) and \(BD\) are divided in the ratio \(AB : BD\).

However, we can also use the fact that \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of \( \triangle ACD \) and the base of \( \triangle ABC \). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \).

The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

The total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b) = 42
\]

Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of \( \triangle ACD \) and the base of \( \triangle ABC \), we can express the area of \( \triangle ACD \) as:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

We know that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, so:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b) = 42
\]

Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), we can use the fact that the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) because \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of \( \triangle ACD \) and the base of \( \triangle ABC \), and it bisects \( \angle BAD \).

Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Thus, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\) for \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation $\ @$ to the fractions $\frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{10}{21}$. The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, we have $\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}$ and $\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}$. So, we identify the values of $m$, $n$, $p$, and $q$ as follows:
- $m = 7$
- $n = 30$
- $p = 10$
- $q = 21$

Now, we substitute these values into the operation definition:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of $7$ and $10$:

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction $\frac{21}{30}$. The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, we multiply 70 by $\frac{7}{10}$:

\[

"1. **Identify the total number of ways to pair the points:**
   - We have 4 points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).
   - The number of ways to pair these 4 points is given by the number of perfect matchings in a complete graph \( K_4 \).
   - The formula for the number of perfect matchings in \( K_{2n} \) is \((2n-1)!!\), where \( n \) is the number of pairs.
   - For \( n = 2 \) (since we have 4 points), the number of perfect matchings is:
     \[
     (2 \cdot 2 - 1)!! = 3!! = 3 \times 1 = 3
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 3 ways to pair the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \).

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - We need to find the number of ways to pair the points such that the segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect.
   - Consider the points \( A, B, C, \) and \( D \) in a plane. For \( AB \) and \( CD \) to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern (e.g., \( A, C, B, D \) or \( A, D, B, C \)).
   - There are exactly 2 such arrangements:
     - \( A, C, B, D \)
     - \( A, D, B, C \)
   - Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability \( P \) of the segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersecting is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the largest circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the largest circle. The radius of the largest circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The shaded region's area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the largest circle, so the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The area of the shaded region is the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle plus the area of the overlapping region (which is counted twice in the area of the larger circle). However, since the smaller circle is completely inside the larger circle and the overlapping region is the area of the smaller circle, the area of the shaded region is simply the area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle:
\[
4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]
But we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\). The area of the shaded region can also be calculated as the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. The area of a sector of a circle is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2\), where \(\theta\) is the angle in degrees.

The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ}
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ}
\]
The area of the shaded region is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle:
\[
\frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} - \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \pi \theta \left( \frac{1}{90^\circ} - \frac{1}{360^\circ} \right) = \pi \theta \left( \frac{4}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{360^\circ} \right) = \pi \theta \left( \frac{3}{360^\circ} \right) = \frac{\pi \theta}{120^\circ}
\]
We know that this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\pi \theta}{120^\circ} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
By canceling \(\pi\) from both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{\theta}{120^\circ} = \frac{5}{3}

Multiplying both sides by 120, we get:

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical chair. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical chair, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in this value, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical chairs are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of one cylindrical chair:
\[ \text{Number of chairs} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function.

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.

   Each turn of the turnip is equivalent to the circumference of the turnip's wheel.

This involves calculating the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 and then subtracting the number of ways to choose 5 members that do not include at least one member from each party.

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members such that all 5 are from the same party. There are two cases to consider: all 5 members are from the Repub like party, or all 5 members are from the Demokraten party.

The number of ways to choose 5 members from the Repub like party (which has 8 members) is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. **Rewrite the left-hand side as a perfect square:**
   \[
   (x - 2)^2 = 4096
   \]

4. **Take the square root of both sides to solve for \(x - 2\):**
   \[
   \sqrt{(x - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4096}
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x - 2 = \pm 64
   \]

5. **Solve for \(x\) by adding 2 to both sides:**
   \[
   x = 2 + 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 2 - 64
   \]
   Simplifying these, we get:
   \[
   x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62
   \]

6. **Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation:**

   For \(x = 66\):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16

   This solution is incorrect.

   For \(x = -62\):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16
   \]
   This solution is also incorrect.

Since both solutions do not satisfy the original equation, there are no real solutions to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we know that:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly. Therefore, we have:

"给定一个等腰三角形 \(ABC\)，其中 \(AB = AC\)， height \(AM = 11\)，点 \(D\) 在 \(AM\) 上，使得 \(AD = 10\) 且 \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\)，我们需要找到 \(\triangle ABC\) 的周长。

首先，设 \(\angle BAC = \theta\)。那么，\(\angle BDC = 3\theta\)。由于 \(AM\) 是从 \(A\) 到 \(BC\) 的高，\(M\) 是 \(BC\) 的中点，且 \(BM = MC\)。设 \(BM = MC = x\)。因此，\(BC = 2x\)。

在 \(\triangle ABM\) 中，我们有：
\[AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}.\]

由于 \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\)，我们可以使用 \(\angle BDC\) 是 \(\triangle BDC\) 的外角这一事实，所以 \(\angle BDC = \angle ABD + \angle ACD\)。然而，由于 \(AB = AC\)，\(\angle ABD = \angle ACD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\)。

现在，考虑 \(\triangle BDM\)。由于 \(D\) 在 \(AM\) 上，且 \(AD = 10\)，\(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\)。在 \(\triangle BDM\) 中，我们有：
\[\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta.\]
\[\angle BMD = 90^\circ.\]
因此，\(\angle DBM = 90^\circ - (180^\circ - 3\theta) = 3\theta - 90^\circ.\)

在 \(\triangle BDM\) 中使用正弦定律，我们有：
\[\frac{BD}{\sin(90^\circ)} = \frac{DM}{\sin(3\theta - 90^\circ)}.\]
由于 \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\) 和 \(\sin(3\theta - 90^\circ) = -\cos(3\theta)\)，我们得到：
\[BD = \frac{1}{-\cos(3\theta)} = -\frac{1}{\cos(3\theta)}.\]

在 \(\triangle BDM\) 中使用余弦定律，我们有：
\[BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos(90^\circ) = x^2 + 1^2 = x^2 + 1.\]
因此，
\[BD = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}.\]
将两个 \(BD\) 的表达式等同，我们得到：
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 1} = \frac{1}{\cos(3\theta)}.\]
由于 \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\)，我们需要找到 \(\cos(\theta)\)。在 \(\triangle ABM\) 中使用余弦定律，我们有：
\[AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 - 2 \cdot AM \cdot BM \cdot \cos(\theta) = 121 + x^2 - 2 \cdot 11 \cdot x \cdot \cos(\theta).\]
由于 \(AB = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\)，我们得到：
\[121 + x^2 = 121 + x^2 - 22x \cos(\theta).\]
因此，
\[0 = -22x \cos(\theta) \implies \cos(\theta) = \frac{11}{x}.\]
将 \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{11}{x}\) 代入 \(\cos(3\theta)\) 的表达式中，我们得到：
\[\cos(3\theta) = 4\left(\frac{11}{x}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{11}{x}\right) = \frac{4 \cdot 11^3}{x^3} - \frac{33}{x} = \frac{5324}{x^3} - \frac{33x^2}{x^3} = \frac{5324 - 33x^2}{x^3}.\]
因此，
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 1} = \frac{x^3}{5324 - 33x^2}.\]
两边平方，我们得到：
\[x^2 + 1 = \frac{x^6}{(5324 - 33x^2)^2}.\]
解这个方程，我们找到 \(x = 6\)。因此，\(BC = 2x = 12\)，且 \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 6^2} = \sqrt{169} = 13\)。

\(\triangle ABC\) 的周长是：
\[AB + AC + BC = 13 + 13 + 12 = 38.\]

"To determine the median of the 27 numbers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the numbers:**
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]

2. **Understand the properties of the median:**
   The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set of 27 numbers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list.

3. **Assume the numbers are evenly distributed:**
   Since the problem does not provide specific numbers, we assume the numbers are evenly distributed around the median. This means the sum of the first 13 numbers is equal to the sum of the last 13 numbers.

4. **Calculate the sum of the first 13 numbers:**
   Let \(M\) be the median. The sum of the first 13 numbers is:
   \[
   \text{Sum of first 13 numbers} = \frac{2187}{2} = 1093.5
   \]

5. **Determine the median:**
   Since the sum of the first 13 numbers is 1093.5, and the sum of the last 13 numbers is also 1093.5, the median \(M\) must be the number that balances the distribution. Therefore, the median is the number that, when added to the sum of the first 13 numbers and the last 13 numbers, gives the total sum of 2187.

   Given that the sum of the first 13 numbers and the last 13 numbers is:
   \[
   1093.5 + 1093.5 = 2187
   \]

   The median \(M\) must be the number that, when added to itself, gives 2187. Therefore:
   \[
   2M = 2187

   M = \frac{2187}{2} = 1093.5

"1. **Define the function and its derivative:**
   Let \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \). We need to find the critical points by taking the derivative and setting it to zero.
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^4 + 4x^2) = 4x^3 + 8x = 4x(x^2 + 2)
   \]
   Setting the derivative equal to zero:
   \[
   4x(x^2 + 2) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + 2 = 0

   Since \( x^2 + 2 = 0 \) has no real solutions, the only critical point is \( x = 0 \).

2. **Determine the behavior of the function at the critical point:**
   Evaluate \( f(x) \) at \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0) = 0^4 + 4 \cdot 0^2 = 0
   \]

3. **Analyze the function at the boundaries of the interval:**
   We need to find the values of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches the boundaries of the interval \((-4, 2)\).

   - As \( x \to -4 \):
     \[
     f(-4) = (-4)^4 + 4(-4)^2 = 256 + 64 = 320

   - As \( x \to 2 \):
     \[
     f(2) = 2^4 + 4 \cdot 2^2 = 16 + 16 = 32

4. **Determine the intervals where \( f(x) \) lies between 0 and 21:**
   We need to find the values of \( x \) such that:
   \[
   0 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]

   - For \( x = 0 \):
     \[
     f(0) = 0

     This is the lower bound.

   - For \( x = \pm \sqrt{3} \):
     \[
     f(\sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{3})^4 + 4(\sqrt{3})^2 = 9 + 12 = 21

     \[
     f(-\sqrt{3}) = (-\sqrt{3})^4 + 4(-\sqrt{3})^2 = 9 + 12 = 21

"To solve for the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by using the given equations and some algebraic identities. The given equations are:

1. \(xyz = 4\)
2. \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\)
3. \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\)

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]
Substituting the given values, we get:
\[4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
which simplifies to:
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]
Substituting this into the earlier equation, we get:
\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

Now, consider the third given equation:
\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.\]
Using the identity \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p\), we can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\). However, a simpler approach is to use the symmetry and the fact that the equation is homogeneous. We can test simple values for \(x, y, z\) that satisfy the first equation \(xyz = 4\). One such set of values is \(x = 1, y = 1, z = 4\), but this does not satisfy the second equation. Instead, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try \(x = 1, y = 1, z = 4\) again but in a different form.

"To determine for which class the number of female bus passengers is closest to 135% of the number of male bus passengers, we need to calculate the number of female and male bus passengers in each class and then compare the ratios.

Let's start with the $10^{\text{th}}$ class, as it is the only one where the percentage of females is less than 50%, making it more likely to have a number of females that is closer to 135% of the number of males.

For the $10^{\text{th}}$ class:
- The percentage of females is 33.1%.
- The percentage of males is 66.9%.

The number of females is:
\[ 300 \times 0.331 = 99.3 \approx 99 \text{ females} \]

The number of males is:
\[ 300 \times 0.669 = 200.7 \approx 201 \text{ males} \]

Now, we need to check if 99 is approximately 135% of 201:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 201 = 1.35 \times 201 = 271.85 \]

Clearly, 99 is not close to 271.85. Let's check the other classes to see if any of them have a number of females that is closer to 135% of the number of males.

For the $9^{\text{th}}$ class:
- The percentage of females is 41.1%.
- The percentage of males is 58.9%.

The number of females is:
\[ 300 \times 0.411 = 123.3 \approx 123 \text{ females} \]

The number of males is:
\[ 300 \times 0.589 = 176.7 \approx 177 \text{ males} \]

Now, we need to check if 123 is approximately 135% of 177:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 177 = 1.35 \times 177 = 237.45 \]

Clearly, 123 is not close to 237.45. Let's check the $11^{\text{th}}$ class.

For the $11^{\text{th}}$ class:
- The percentage of females is 20.6%.
- The percentage of males is 79.4%.

The number of females is:
\[ 300 \times 0.206 = 61.8 \approx 62 \text{ females} \]

The number of males is:
\[ 300 \times 0.794 = 238.2 \approx 238 \text{ males} \]

Now, we need to check if 62 is approximately 135% of 238:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 238 = 1.35 \times 238 = 317.3 \]

Clearly, 62 is not close to 317.3. Let's check the $12^{\text{th}}$ class.

For the $12^{\text{th}}$ class:
- The percentage of females is 11.6%.
- The percentage of males is 88.4%.

The number of females is:
\[ 300 \times 0.116 = 34.8 \approx 35 \text{ females} \]

The number of males is:
\[ 300 \times 0.884 = 265.2 \approx 265 \text{ males} \]

Now, we need to check if 35 is approximately 135% of 265:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 265 = 1.35 \times 265 = 357.75 \]

Clearly, 35 is not close to 357.75. However, we can see that the closest class is the $10^{\text{th}}$ class, where the number of females (99) is closer to 135% of the number of males (201) than any other class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the field, we need to understand the shape and dimensions of the field. The field is a rectangle with two semicircles on its sides, and the total perimeter of the field (including the semicircles) is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The perimeter of the field consists of the two lengths of the rectangle, the two widths of the rectangle, and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \frac{W}{2} \), so the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( \pi W \). Therefore, the total perimeter of the field is given by:
\[ 2L + 2W + \pi W = 400. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2L + (2 + \pi)W = 400. \]
We can solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[ 2L = 400 - (2 + \pi)W, \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{(2 + \pi)W}{2}. \]

The area \( A \) of the field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \), and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{8} \pi W^2 \), so the total area of the two semicircles is \( \frac{1}{4} \pi W^2 \). Therefore, the total area \( A \) is:
\[ A = L W + \frac{1}{4} \pi W^2. \]
Substituting \( L = 200 - \frac{(2 + \pi)W}{2} \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( 200 - \frac{(2 + \pi)W}{2} \right) W + \frac{1}{4} \pi W^2, \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{(2 + \pi)W^2}{2} + \frac{1}{4} \pi W^2, \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{2W^2}{2} - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4}, \]
\[ A = 200W - W^2 - \frac{\pi W^2}{4}, \]
\[ A = 200W - W^2 \left( 1 + \frac{\pi}{4} \right). \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - 2W \left( 1 + \frac{\pi}{4} \right) = 0, \]
\[ 200 = 2W \left( 1 + \frac{\pi}{4} \right), \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{2 \left( 1 + \frac{\pi}{4} \right)} = \frac{200}{2 + \frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{200}{\frac{4 + \pi}{2}} = \frac{400}{4 + \pi}. \]

Substituting \( W = \frac{400}{4 + \pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{(2 + \pi) \frac{400}{4 + \pi}}{2} = 200 - \frac{400(2 + \pi)}{2(4 + \pi)} = 200 - \frac{200(2 + \pi)}{4 + \pi} = \frac{200(4 + \pi) - 200(2 + \pi)}{4 + \pi} = \frac{200(4 + \pi - 2 - \pi)}{4 + \pi} = \frac{200 \cdot 2}{4 + \pi} = \frac{400}{4 + \pi}. \]

So, \( L = W = \frac{400}{4 + \pi} \). The area \( A \) is:
\[ A = L W = \left( \frac{400}{4 + \pi} \right)^2 = \frac{160000}{(4 + \pi)^2}. \]

\[ 4 + \pi \approx 7.14, \]
\[ (4 + \pi)^2 \approx 7.14^2 \approx 51.0 \text{ (approximately)}, \]
\[ A \approx \frac{160000}{51} \approx 3137.25. \]

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle S\) is the right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles. Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]

We know that the sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Thus:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side \(RT\):
\[
RT^2 + ST^2 = RS^2
\]
\[
RT^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
\]
\[
RT^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2
\]
\[
RT^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2
\]
\[
RT^2 = 21k^2
\]
\[
RT = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In \(\triangle RST\), \(\angle T\) is opposite side \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{5k}{k\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{21}}

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{21}\):
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{21}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5\sqrt{21}}{21}

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the curve given by the equation \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( D(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since minimizing \( D(x, y) \) is equivalent to minimizing \( D^2(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \), we will minimize the function \( f(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 \).

First, substitute \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x) = x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]

Expand and simplify the expression:

\[
f(x) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9) = x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

To find the critical points, take the derivative of \( f(x) \) with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three critical points: \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \).

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]
\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]
\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimum distance squared is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Here, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Since \( a \) can be expressed as the square of a whole number (10 = 3^2 + 1), the values of \( a \) and \( b \) satisfy the given conditions. Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the function \( f(x) \).

### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is defined as \( f(x) = 3 - x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[
3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
\]
So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
\]
Since \( -3 \leq 3 \), this solution is valid. So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is defined as \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
\]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[
-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
\]
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid in this case.

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
\]
We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
-(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
\]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). We need to check if there are any other real roots, but since the problem is asking for the inverse and we have already found a valid solution in the first case, we can conclude that there are no valid solutions in the second case for \( f^{-1}(6) \).

### Conclusion
From the first case, we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \) and \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \). Therefore,
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to use the property of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property.

Let's denote the distances from point \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) as \( d_A, d_B, d_C, d_D, d_E, d_F \) respectively. We are given that \( d_A = 3 \), \( d_B = 7 \), \( d_C = 8 \), \( d_D = 9 \), and \( d_E = 11 \). We need to find \( d_F \).

According to the property mentioned, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is constant. Therefore, we can write:

\[ d_A^2 + d_B^2 + d_C^2 + d_D^2 + d_E^2 + d_F^2 = \text{constant} \]

\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \]

So, we have:

\[ 324 + d_F^2 = \text{constant} \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, the constant is 324 plus the square of the distance to the sixth vertex. Therefore, we can write:

\[ d_F^2 = \text{constant} - 324 \]

Since the constant is 324 plus the square of the distance to the sixth vertex, we have:

\[ d_F^2 = 324 - 324 = 0 \]

Thus, \( d_F = \sqrt{0} = 0 \).

The mass of the softball is 200 grams, and the mass of the baseball is 150 grams. Since the playtime is inversely proportional to the mass, the ratio of the playtimes will be the inverse ratio of the masses. Therefore, the ratio of the playtime of the baseball to the playtime of the softball is:

2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to determine the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)
\]

Using the fact that \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we can express \((\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3)\) as follows:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (-2)(-2) - 0 = 4
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 4 - 2 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). Using the identity for the product of the roots of a polynomial, we have:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)
\]

We can use the fact that the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\) is given by the polynomial \(P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 + 2\). The product of the roots of this polynomial is \(-2\), so:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2
\]

Now, we know that \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 2t^2 + 2 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are the values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\). By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots is 2, the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is 0, and the product of the roots is 2. Therefore, the values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 2t^2 + 2 = 0\), which are \(1 + i\sqrt{3}\), \(1 - i\sqrt{3}\), and \(-1\).

Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{1 + i\sqrt{3}, 1 - i\sqrt{3}, -1\}\). The union of these values is:

"To determine the cost of one Maltese coin, we start by defining the variables for the costs of the Maltese coin and the Jumbo-R 添加gummi. Let \( x \) be the cost of one Maltese coin in cents, and \( y \) be the cost of one Jumbo-R 添加gummi in cents. We can convert the given prices into cents for easier calculation. The first statement says that two Maltese coins and one Jumbo-R 添加gummi cost \$1.24, which is 124 cents. The second statement says that five Maltese coins and one Jumbo-R 添加gummi cost \$1.82, which is 182 cents. This gives us the following system of linear equations:

\[
2x + y = 124
\]
\[
5x + y = 182
\]

To eliminate \( y \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(5x + y) - (2x + y) = 182 - 124
\]
\[
3x = 58
\]
\[
x = \frac{58}{3} = 19.3333
\]

Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as it represents a cost in cents), we recognize that the division should yield an integer. Let's recheck the arithmetic carefully:

\[
3x = 58 \implies x = \frac{58}{3} = 19.3333

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Identify the quotient and the remainder.

Let's start with the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

This means that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9 and a remainder of 0. We can express this relationship using the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that:

\[ a = bq + r \]

where \(0 \leq r < b\).

In our case, \(a = 54\), \(b = 6\), \(q = 9\), and \(r = 0\). Plugging these values into the equation, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.0472 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total and how much they need to make up for the M germs in the books, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they have.
2. Determine how much more money they need to make up for the M germs in the books.
3. Convert the amount needed from dollars to cents.

First, let's add up the amounts each person has:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add these step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[

So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine how much more money they need to make up for the M germs in the books. Since the problem does not specify the exact amount needed, we assume they need to make up the difference from a certain amount. However, since the problem asks for the amount they have in cents, we can assume they need to make up the difference from a round amount, typically \$100 or \$200, but since it's not specified, we can just use the total they have and convert it to cents.

To convert \$126.59 to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

Then, calculate the total score for the students who scored 100 points:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, sum these total scores to get the overall total score:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given 4x4 magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

1. **Sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (2n-9) = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 + 2n - 9 = 4n - 8
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   4n - 8 = S
   \]

2. **Sum of the second row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) + 1 = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   2 + n + n - 1 + 1 = 2n + 2
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[

3. **Sum of the third row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (2n-9) = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 + 2n - 9 = 4n - 8
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   4n - 8 = S
   \]

4. **Sum of the fourth row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) + 1 = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   2 + n + n - 1 + 1 = 2n + 2
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   2n + 2 = S

5. **Sum of the first column:**

   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   n - 3 + 2 + n - 1 + 2 = 2n

   So, we have:

   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   3 + 3n = S

   So, we have:

7. **Sum of the third column:**
   \[
   (n+1) + (n-1) + (n-1) + 1 = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   n + 1 + n - 1 + n - 1 + 1 = 3n

   So, we have:
   \[
   3n = S

8. **Sum of the fourth column:**
   \[
   (2n-9) + 1 + (n-1) + 1 = S
   \]
   Simplifying the left-hand side:
   \[
   2n - 9 + 1 + n - 1 + 1 = 3n - 8
   \]
   So, we have:
   \[
   3n - 8 = S

9. **Sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):**

10. **Sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):**
    \[
    (n+1) + n + (n-1) + (2n-9) = S

    Simplifying the left-hand side:
    \[
    n + 1 + n + n - 1 + 2n - 9 = 5n - 8
    \]
    So, we have:
    \[
    5n - 8 = S

Now, we have the following equations:
\[
4n - 8 = S

We can solve for \( n \) by equating any two of these equations. Let's equate \( 4n - 8 \) and \( 2n + 2 \):
\[
4n - 8 = 2n + 2
\]
Subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
2n - 8 = 2

Add 8 to both sides:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other property of \(\omega\) is that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) and \(\omega = -1 - \omega^2\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify each term separately. Consider the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). We can rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} \cdot \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{2 + \omega + \omega^2}.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), so the denominator simplifies to:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1} = 1 + \omega^2\).

Similarly, for the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} \cdot \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega}{2 + \omega + \omega^2}.
\]
Again, since \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), the denominator simplifies to:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1} = 1 + \omega\).

Adding these two results together, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = (1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega) = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), so:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
