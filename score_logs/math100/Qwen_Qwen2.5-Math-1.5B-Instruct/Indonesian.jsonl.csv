"To determine if \(DE\) is a valid length in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we need to use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, \(DE\) is the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are \(DF\) and \(EF\).

Given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify that \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Solving for \(DE\), we get:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now, we need to verify that this value of \(DE\) satisfies the Pythagorean theorem. According to the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DE^2 = DF^2 + EF^2
\]
We already know \(DE = 10\) and \(EF = 7\). To find \(DF\), we use the fact that \(\cos D = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 D}\). Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we have:
\[
\cos D = \sqrt{1 - 0.7^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.49} = \sqrt{0.51}
\]
And since \(\cos D = \frac{DF}{DE}\), we get:
\[
\cos D = \frac{DF}{10} = \sqrt{0.51}
\]
Solving for \(DF\), we get:
\[
DF = 10 \cdot \sqrt{0.51} = 10 \cdot \sqrt{\frac{51}{100}} = 10 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{51}}{10} = \sqrt{51}
\]

Now, we can verify the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DE^2 = DF^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = (\sqrt{51})^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = 51 + 49
\]
\[
100 = 100
\]
Since the equation holds true, \(DE = 10\) is a valid length. Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \), we need to perform a rotation of the complex number \( z \) around the complex number \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction. The steps to do this are as follows:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this as:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}.\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine how many ways the 8 dudok can sit around a circular table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit next to each other, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 and the other 5 dudok) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) ways.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Therefore, the number of ways the 8 dudok can sit around a circular table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the summation:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute the binomial coefficient and simplify:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

"To solve the problem, we start with the given congruence \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). This means that \( n \) can be written in the form \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \). We need to find the remainder when the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) into the expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 2 + 2)(7k + 2 + 4)(7k + 2 + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8).
\]
Next, we simplify each term modulo 7:
\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}.
\]
So, the expression becomes:
\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}.

Now, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \) modulo 7:
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}.

Then,
\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated to return a regular pentagon to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated to coincide with itself at certain angles.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, this is \((5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ\). Each interior angle of a regular pentagon is therefore \(540^\circ / 5 = 108^\circ\).

However, we are interested in the rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon can be rotated to coincide with itself at angles that are multiples of \(72^\circ\). This is because \(360^\circ / 5 = 72^\circ\). This means that rotating the pentagon by \(72^\circ\), \(144^\circ\), \(216^\circ\), \(288^\circ\), or \(360^\circ\) will return it to its original position.

The smallest positive angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position is \(72^\circ\).

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that must be rotated to return the regular pentagon to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth point on the line that passes through the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we first need to find the equation of the line. We can do this by calculating the slope of the line using two of the given points.

The slope \(m\) of a line passing through two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:
\[ m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} \]

Using the points \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\), the slope is:
\[ m = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = \frac{5}{1} = 5 \]

Now that we have the slope, we can use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is:
\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]

Using the point \((5, 3)\) and the slope \(m = 5\), the equation of the line is:
\[ y - 3 = 5(x - 5) \]
\[ y - 3 = 5x - 25 \]
\[ y = 5x - 22 \]

We know that the point \((x, y)\) lies on this line, so it must satisfy the equation \(y = 5x - 22\). Since \(x > 7\), we can choose any value for \(x\) greater than 7 and find the corresponding \(y\). For simplicity, let's choose \(x = 8\):
\[ y = 5(8) - 22 = 40 - 22 = 18 \]

So, the coordinates of the fourth point are \((8, 18)\). To find the value of \(x + y\):
\[ x + y = 8 + 18 = 26 \]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:

"Given that \(\triangle ABC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

First, recall the definitions of the trigonometric functions in a right triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute the definitions of \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\):
\[
\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}
\]
Let the length of the adjacent side be \(x\). Then the length of the opposite side is \(2x\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the hypotenuse:
\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{x^2 + (2x)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4x^2} = \sqrt{5x^2} = x\sqrt{5}

Now, we can find \(\tan A\):

"To analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine its vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
This quadratic equation can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
So, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to examine the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Therefore,
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the calculation. Let's start by expressing the given expression in a form that makes it easier to compute.

First, notice that \(99\) can be written as \(100 - 1\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, so the largest singular value is

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity, which means \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). This implies that \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, we use the fact that \( z^5 = 1 \) to simplify \( \frac{1}{z} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} \). Since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( z^4 = \frac{1}{z} \) and \( z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2} \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[ z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1. \]

Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, we subtract the two base 10 numbers:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to determine the coefficients for the powers of 9. We start by finding the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36. The powers of 9 are \(9^0 = 1\), \(9^1 = 9\), and \(9^2 = 81\) (which is too large).

We divide 36 by 9:

\]
This simplifies to:
\[

\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one tree in terms of squigs. Let's denote the weight of one tree as \( T \), the weight of one squig as \( S \), and the weight of one goolee as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One tree is equal in weight to three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two trees and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the weight of one tree in terms of squigs. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Now, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Simplify the equation:
\[
T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
\[
T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
3T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
T = \frac{4S}{3}
\]

Thus, the weight of one tree is \(\frac{4}{3}\) squigs. Therefore, the number of trees that are equal in weight to one squig is:
\[

So, the number of trees that are equal in weight to one squig is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) is equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product of the two polynomials and then compare the coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

For \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

For \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

For \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

First, solve for \(a\) from the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t\):
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in the equation for \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 26 \implies 6 + 20 = 26 \implies 26 = 26

Finally, verify the equation for \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -8 \implies -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \implies -8 = -8
\]

All the equations are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the given information about the rate at which the volume of water is added and the rate at which the water level rises.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the water is being added at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and the water level is rising at a rate of 1 meter per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is equal to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (which is \( \pi r^2 \)) multiplied by the rate at which the water level rises (which is 1 meter per hour).

So, we can write:
\[ \pi r^2 \cdot 1 = 20\pi \]
This simplifies to:
\[ \pi r^2 = 20\pi \]
By dividing both sides by \( \pi \), we get:
\[ r^2 = 20 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[ r = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its behavior.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of the function at \(x = a\). The function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\) if:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]
This means:
\[
a \cdot a + 2a = a \cdot a^2.
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(a\), we get:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]
This gives us the solutions:
\[
a = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 - a - 2 = 0.
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(a^2 - a - 2 = 0\), we get:
\[
a = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm 3}{2}.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
a = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad a = -1.
\]
Since \(a\) is a positive integer, we discard \(a = -1\) and \(a = 0\). Therefore, the only possible value for \(a\) is 2.

Next, we need to verify that \(a = 2\) ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once. For \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[

\[
f(2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8 \quad \text{and} \quad f(2) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8.
\]
This ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = 2\) and does not intersect any horizontal line more than once.

"To determine if the given equation represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \(r\) is the radius.

The given equation is:
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\]

First, we complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

For the \(x\) terms:
\[x^2 - 10x\]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25\]
This can be written as:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25\]

For the \(y\) terms:
\[y^2 + 6y\]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9\]
This can be written as:
\[(y + 3)^2 - 9\]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\]

For the equation to represent a circle with a radius of 1, the right side must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\):
\[34 - c = 1\]

"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + 1 - \lambda) = 0.
\]
This equation has solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This simplifies to \(0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda\), which is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a valid fixed point for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to check if there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which is true. If \(x = 1\), then \(f(f(1)) = \lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda + \lambda) = 0\), which is also true. For \(x \in (0,1)\), we can divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), the cubic equation must have a root in \((0,1)\). The discriminant of the quadratic equation \(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 = 0\) is \(\lambda^2 - 4\lambda\), which is non-negative for \(\lambda \geq 4\). However, for \(\lambda < 4\), the quadratic equation has real roots, and we need to check if the cubic equation has a root in \((0,1)\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and the cubic equation, we find that for \(\lambda \in [1,4]\), there always exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To solve for the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) is given by the expression

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formulas, we can rewrite the terms involving products of cosines and sines. Notice that:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]

So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formulas again, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ.
\]

So the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

By further simplifying, we find that the expression simplifies to \(\tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to divide a hyperbola into two parts, we need to understand the properties and structure of a hyperbola. A hyperbola is a type of conic section that is defined as the set of all points in a plane such that the absolute value of the difference of the distances from two fixed points (foci) is constant.

When we talk about dividing a hyperbola into two parts, we are typically referring to the number of ways we can split the hyperbola into two distinct regions. However, a hyperbola is a single, continuous curve and does not have any breaks or points of division that would create separate regions. Therefore, the only way to ""divide"" a hyperbola is to consider it as a single whole.

If we interpret the question in a more abstract sense, such as how many parts we can create by drawing lines or curves on the hyperbola, the simplest way to divide it would be to draw a single line that intersects the hyperbola at two points. This line would split the hyperbola into two separate regions. However, if we are considering the hyperbola itself as a single unit, there is only one way to consider it as a whole.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum value might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
Now, we need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \).

To find the critical points of \( g(x) \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We also need to check the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{10 - 2\sqrt{5}}}{4}. \]

However, we can use the fact that \( z \) is a root of unity for some specific angle. The angle \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), and we need to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). By properties of roots of unity, we know that \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

Since \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), and knowing the periodicity of the cosine function, we can use the fact that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(85\theta \mod 360^\circ) \). Given the specific value of \( \cos\theta \), we can determine that \( \cos(85\theta) = -1 \) (this is a known result for this specific angle). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2(-1) = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the given triangle \(ABC\).

1. **Identify the centroid \(G\):**
   The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Determine the position of \(G\) relative to \(BC\):**
   Since \(G\) is the centroid, the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) will intersect \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(M\) and \(N\) respectively, such that \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\) in the same ratio as \(G\) divides the medians. Specifically, \(M\) and \(N\) will divide \(AB\) and \(AC\) in the ratio 2:1.

3. **Calculate the area of \(\triangle WMN\):**
   The line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and divides \(\triangle ABC\) into two regions: a smaller triangle \(\triangle WMN\) and a trapezoid. Since \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\) in the ratio 2:1, the smaller triangle \(\triangle WMN\) is similar to \(\triangle ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{1}{3}\) (because the height from \(W\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\)).

   The area of a similar triangle is proportional to the square of the similarity ratio. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle WMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

4. **Calculate the area of \(\triangle WMN\):**
   Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle WMN\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle WMN = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16

"To determine the probability that at least one of the two buses selected from the 3 buses is a math bus, we can use the complementary probability approach. This involves calculating the probability that neither of the two buses selected is a math bus and then subtracting this probability from 1.

First, let's identify the total number of buses and the number of buses that are not math buses:
- Total buses: 3
- Math buses: 1
- Non-math buses: 2

The total number of ways to choose 2 buses out of 3 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial. So, the total number of ways to choose 2 buses out of 3 is:
\[ \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!1!} = 3 \]

The number of ways to choose 2 non-math buses out of the 2 non-math buses is:
\[ \binom{2}{2} = \frac{2!}{2!0!} = 1 \]

The probability that neither of the two buses selected is a math bus is the number of ways to choose 2 non-math buses divided by the total number of ways to choose 2 buses:
\[ P(\text{neither is a math bus}) = \frac{\binom{2}{2}}{\binom{3}{2}} = \frac{1}{3} \]

Therefore, the probability that at least one of the two buses selected is a math bus is the complement of the above probability:
\[ P(\text{at least one is a math bus}) = 1 - P(\text{neither is a math bus}) = 1 - \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3} \]

So, the probability that at least one of the two buses selected is a math bus is:

"To determine the fifth term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to use the information given about the fourth and eighth terms. Let's denote the first term of the arithmetic sequence by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:
\[ a_4 = a + 3d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a + 7d = 500 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \( a + 3d = 200 \)
2. \( a + 7d = 500 \)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a + 7d) - (a + 3d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 4d = 300 \]
\[ d = 75 \]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[ a + 3(75) = 200 \]
\[ a + 225 = 200 \]
\[ a = 200 - 225 \]
\[ a = -25 \]

Now that we have \(a = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the fifth term (\(a_5\)) using the general formula:
\[ a_5 = a + 4d \]
\[ a_5 = -25 + 4(75) \]
\[ a_5 = -25 + 300 \]
\[ a_5 = 275 \]

   \[
   2^2 = 4
   \]
   \[
   5^7 = 78125

   Let's do the division step-by-step:

   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 21 \) zero times, so we write \( 0. \) and add a zero to \( 21 \), making it \( 210 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 210 \) zero times, so we write another zero and add another zero, making it \( 2100 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 2100 \) zero times, so we write another zero and add another zero, making it \( 21000 \).

   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 210000 \) zero times, so we write another zero and add another zero, making it \( 2100000 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 2100000 \) six times (since \( 312500 \times 6 = 1875000 \)), so we write \( 6 \) and subtract \( 1875000 \) from \( 2100000 \), leaving a remainder of \( 225000 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 225000 \) zero times, so we write another zero and add another zero, making it \( 2250000 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 2250000 \) zero times, so we write another zero and add another zero, making it \( 22500000 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 22500000 \) seven times (since \( 312500 \times 7 = 2187500 \)), so we write \( 7 \) and subtract \( 2187500 \) from \( 22500000 \), leaving a remainder of \( 62500 \).
   - \( 312500 \) goes into \( 62500 \) zero times, so we write another zero and add another zero, making it \( 625000 \).

"To determine the value of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect number of the \( n \)-th type, we need to understand the properties of perfect numbers. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

The general form of even perfect numbers is given by:
\[ 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) \]
where \( 2^p - 1 \) is a Mersenne prime. This means that \( p \) must be a prime number, and \( 2^p - 1 \) must also be a prime number.

Given that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect number, we need to find the value of \( n \) such that:
\[ 2^{24} = 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) \]

By comparing the two expressions, we can see that:
\[ p-1 = 23 \]
\[ p = 24 \]

However, \( p \) must be a prime number. Since 24 is not a prime number, \( 2^{24} \) cannot be a perfect number in the form \( 2^{p-1}(2^p - 1) \).

Therefore, there is no value of \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect number of the \( n \)-th type. The problem statement must have an error or a different interpretation. Given the standard form of perfect numbers, the correct interpretation should be that \( 2^{24} \) is not a perfect number at all.

Thus, the correct answer is:

"To determine the number of nickels that secara miliki, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things:
1. The total value of the coins is 75 cent.
2. The value of the dimes and nickels combined is 75 cent.

The value of the dimes is \( 10d \) cent (since each dime is worth 10 cent), and the value of the nickels is \( 5n \) cent (since each nickel is worth 5 cent). Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[ 10d + 5n = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

We need to find the number of nickels, \( n \). To do this, we need to express \( n \) in terms of \( d \):
\[ n = 15 - 2d \]

Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 15 - 2d \) must also be a non-negative integer. This means that \( d \) can be any integer from 0 to 7 (because if \( d \) were 8 or more, \( 15 - 2d \) would be negative).

Let's check the possible values of \( d \) and the corresponding values of \( n \):

- If \( d = 0 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 0 = 15 \).
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 1 = 13 \).
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 2 = 11 \).
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \).
- If \( d = 4 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 4 = 7 \).
- If \( d = 5 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \).
- If \( d = 6 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 6 = 3 \).

"To determine the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of 450. The number 450 can be factored into prime factors as follows:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's break this down:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be a multiple of 9.
3. **Divisibility by 25**: The last two digits of the number must be 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.

Given these conditions, we need to find the smallest number consisting only of the digits 0 and 1 that ends in 00 and has a digit sum that is a multiple of 9. Let's start by constructing such a number:

- The number must end in 00, so we can write it as \( \overline{a_1a_2\ldots a_n00} \).
- The sum of the digits \( a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_n \) must be a multiple of 9.

We need to find the smallest \( n \) such that the sum of \( n \) ones (since each \( a_i \) is either 0 or 1) is a multiple of 9. The smallest such \( n \) is 9, because \( 1 + 1 + \ldots + 1 = 9 \) (9 ones).

Therefore, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 11111111100. Let's verify:

- The sum of the digits is \( 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 9 \), which is a multiple of 9.

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify the expression. This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). So the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\cos 10^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines and cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

So the original expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

1. **Understanding Cylindrical Coordinates**:
   - \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
   - \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
   - \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

2. **Interpreting the Equation \(z = c\)**:
   - The equation \(z = c\) means that for any point on the surface, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\).
   - This implies that the surface is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and is located at a constant height \(c\) above the \(xy\)-plane.

3. **Visualizing the Surface**:
   - Since the \(z\)-coordinate is constant, the surface extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions, but it remains at a fixed height \(c\).
   - This describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

4. **Identifying the Shape**:
   - A plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and at a constant height \(c\) above it is essentially a horizontal plane.
   - In the context of the given options, a horizontal plane is often referred to as a ""horizontal plane"" or simply a ""plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane"".

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the magnitude of their cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To determine the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49.
\]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x+5) = 0 \). If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). This is because if \( f(r_i) = 0 \), then \( g(r_i - 5) = f((r_i - 5) + 5) = f(r_i) = 0 \).

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the cotangent function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to handle the second and third terms. We will use the identity for the sine of a double angle:
\[
\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = (2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2 = 4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we can express \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}\) as:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 20^\circ\right)^2} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

For the third term, we use the identity for the sine of a triple angle:
\[
\sin 3x = 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\sin^2 40^\circ = (2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 = 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we can express \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}\) as:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 40^\circ\right)^2} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we can sum the three terms:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), we get:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} \quad \text{and} \quad \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3 \tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3 \tan^2 x}\), we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3 \tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3 \tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Solving this equation, we find that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 4 = 7.

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:

\[

\]

We are given that the sum of all the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

First, we solve for \( n-2 \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \( n-2 \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

3. **Rearrange the equation**: To solve for \( t \), we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **Solve the quadratic congruence**: We use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
   \[
   t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}

   Simplifying inside the square root:
   \[
   t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}

   \[
   t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}

   \[
   t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}

   \[
   t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}

5. **Find the integer solutions**: Since \( t \) must be an integer, we need \( \sqrt{2} \) to be an integer. However, \( \sqrt{2} \) is not an integer. Therefore, we need to find another approach.

6. **Check for integer solutions directly**: We test values of \( t \) from 1 to 22 to see if they satisfy the original congruence \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

   - For \( t = 1 \):
     \[
     1(1 + 2) = 3 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}

   - For \( t = 2 \):
     \[
     2(2 + 2) = 8 \not\equiv 1 \pmod{23}

   - For \( t = 3 \):
     \[

Notice that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) from the parametric equations of the lines. The vector connecting these points is:

The distance between two parallel lines is the length of the projection of this vector onto the normal vector of the direction vector of the lines. The normal vector to the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) can be found by taking the cross product of this vector with any other vector that is not parallel to it.

The normal vector to the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) can be taken as \(\begin{pmatrix} 9 \\ 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\) (by taking the cross product with \(\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\)). The unit vector in this direction is:

   - The x-coordinates range from \(-5\) to \(5\).
   - The y-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\).

2. **Count the integer x-coordinates within the range:**
   - The integer x-coordinates are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}
\]

We know from the problem statement that:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) passes through the midpoints of the two diagonals of \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the area of \(\triangle ACD\) as \(x\) and the area of \(\triangle ABC\) as \(y\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), the trapezium \(ABCD\) can be divided into two triangles, \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), and a rectangle or parallelogram in the middle. The area of the trapezium is the sum of the areas of these two triangles:
\[
x + y = 42.
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as one of its legs. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD.
\]

The line segment \(\overline{AC}\) passes through the midpoints of the diagonals of \(\angle BAD\), which implies that \(\overline{AC}\) is the median of the trapezium. This means that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is equal to the area of \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
x = y.
\]

Substituting \(y = x\) into the equation \(x + y = 42\), we get:
\[
x + x = 42,
\]
\[

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}

4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

First, identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\):
- \(m = 7\)
- \(n = 30\)
- \(p = 10\)
- \(q = 21\)

Now, substitute these values into the operation definition:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)

Next, perform the multiplication inside the parentheses:
\[

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen at random and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that two chords ( segments \(AB\) and \(CD\)) intersect when four points are chosen randomly on a circle.

2. **Visualize the Circle and Points**: Imagine a circle with four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on its circumference. The chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged such that one pair of points from each chord are on opposite sides of the other pair of points.

3. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first chord, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second chord. This is given by:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]
   However, since the order of the chords does not matter, we divide by 2 to avoid double-counting:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   So, there are 3 distinct ways to arrange the points such that the chords intersect.

4. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 3 distinct arrangements, only 1 will result in the chords intersecting. This is because if we label the points in a clockwise order as \(A, B, C, D\), the only way the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is if the points are arranged as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

5. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) in degrees. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The radii of the two circles are 1 and 2.
   - The total area of the annular region (the region between the two circles) that is shaded is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

2. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
   \[
   \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the smaller circle:**
   The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
   \[
   \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the annular region:**
   The area of the annular region is the difference between the area of the larger circle and the area of the smaller circle:
   \[
   4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
   \]

5. **Determine the shaded area:**
   The shaded area is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
   \[
   \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

6. **Relate the shaded area to the angle \( \angle ADC \):**
   The shaded area is a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. The area of a sector of a circle is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \text{area of the circle}\), where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.

   Let \( \theta \) be the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \). The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi
   \]
   The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi
   \]
   The shaded area is the difference between these two areas:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi - \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times (4\pi - \pi) = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 3\pi
   \]
   We know this shaded area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 3\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Simplify the equation by canceling \(\pi\) from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 3 = \frac{5}{3}

   Solve for \(\theta\):
   \[
   \theta = \frac{5}{3} \times \frac{360^\circ}{3} = \frac{5 \times 360^\circ}{9} = 200^\circ

First, let's calculate the volume of one cylindrical glass. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical glass, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in this value, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, to find out how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill the spherical tank, we divide the volume of the tank by the volume of one glass:

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.

Next, we need to find the product of these two sine values:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We need to find the largest of these six rational numbers. To do this, we will assume that five of the numbers are equal to 1, and the sixth number is the largest. This is a reasonable assumption because it simplifies the problem and allows us to maximize the value of the sixth number.

Let \(a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 = 1\). Then:
\[
a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot a_4 \cdot a_5 \cdot a_6 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot a_6 = a_6 = 120
\]

Now, we check if the sum of these numbers equals 144:
\[
a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 120 = 126
\]

Since 126 is less than 144, we need to increase the value of \(a_6\) while keeping the product equal to 120. Let's try increasing \(a_6\) to 144 and adjust the other numbers accordingly.

If \(a_6 = 144\), then:
\[
a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot a_4 \cdot a_5 \cdot 144 = 120
\]

Solving for the product of the other five numbers:
\[
a_1 \cdot a_2 \cdot a_3 \cdot a_4 \cdot a_5 = \frac{120}{144} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Since we want to maximize \(a_6\), we set \(a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = a_4 = a_5 = \sqrt[5]{\frac{5}{6}}\). However, this approach is complex and not straightforward. Instead, we can use a simpler method by assuming the numbers are close to each other.

Let's try another approach by assuming the numbers are close to 24. If we assume the numbers are 24, 24, 24, 24, 24, and \(x\), then:
\[
24 \cdot 24 \cdot 24 \cdot 24 \cdot 24 \cdot x = 120
\]

Solving for \(x\):
\[
24^5 \cdot x = 120
\]
\[
x = \frac{120}{24^5}
\]

This value is very small and not practical. Therefore, we need to find a more practical solution.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   (\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. **Simplify the left-hand side of the equation:**
   Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
   \[
   (x - 2)^2 = 4096
   \]

4. **Take the square root of both sides to solve for \(x - 2\):**
   \[
   \sqrt{(x - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4096}
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   |x - 2| = 64

5. **Solve the absolute value equation:**
   The absolute value equation \(|x - 2| = 64\) has two solutions:

Therefore, the expression becomes:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), and point \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( AB = AC \), \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

Next, we use the fact that \( D \) is on \( \overline{AM} \) and \( AD = 10 \), so \( DM = 1 \). We will use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \) and \( \triangle ABC \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\angle BDC = 3\theta, \quad \angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}
\]
Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{CD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)}
\]
Since \( BD = CD \), we have:
\[
BC = 2BD \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)
\]

In \( \triangle ABC \), we have:
\[
\angle BAC = \theta, \quad \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}
\]
Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABC \):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{AC}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)}
\]
Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[
BC = 2AB \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( BC \):
\[
2BD \sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right) = 2AB \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]
Since \( AB = AC \) and \( BD = \frac{BC}{2} \), we have:
\[
BC = 2 \cdot 11 \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = 22 \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

Now, we need to find \( \theta \). Using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle, we can use the fact that the sum of the angles in a triangle is \( 180^\circ \). From the geometry of the problem, we can deduce that \( \theta = 36^\circ \).

Therefore, \( \angle BAC = 36^\circ \), and \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 72^\circ \). The sides of the triangle are in the golden ratio, so \( AB = AC = \frac{11}{\phi} \) and \( BC = 11 \), where \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{\phi} + 11 = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}} + 11 = 2 \cdot \frac{22}{1 + \sqrt{5}} + 11 = 2 \cdot \frac{22(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} + 11 = 11(3 - \sqrt{5}) + 11 = 11(4 - \sqrt{5}) = 22

"To determine the median of 27 positive integers whose product is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We have 27 positive integers whose product is \(3^7\). We need to find the median of these integers.

2. **Prime factorization**: Since the product of the integers is \(3^7\), each integer must be a power of 3. Let the integers be \(3^{a_1}, 3^{a_2}, \ldots, 3^{a_{27}}\). The product of these integers is:
   \[
   3^{a_1} \cdot 3^{a_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot 3^{a_{27}} = 3^{a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{27}}

   Given that this product equals \(3^7\), we have:

3. **Determine the median**: The median of a set of 27 numbers is the 14th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. To find the median, we need to consider the possible values of \(a_i\) that sum to 7.

4. **Distribute the sum**: Since \(a_i\) are non-negative integers, we need to distribute the sum 7 among 27 integers. The simplest way to do this is to have some integers equal to 1 and the rest equal to 0. This is because having any integer greater than 1 would make the sum of the integers greater than 7.

5. **Calculate the distribution**: Let \(k\) be the number of integers equal to 1. Then the remaining \(27 - k\) integers must be 0. The sum of these integers is:
   \[
   k \cdot 1 + (27 - k) \cdot 0 = k

   We need \(k = 7\). Therefore, we have 7 integers equal to 1 and 20 integers equal to 0.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2.\]
We can complete the square for the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\):
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4.\]
This transformation is useful because it allows us to analyze the expression more easily. Now, we need to solve the inequality:
\[-4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21.\]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25.\]
Next, we take the square root of all parts of the inequality. Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always non-negative, we only need to consider the positive square root:
\[0 < x^2 + 2 < 5.\]
Subtracting 2 from all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-2 < x^2 < 3.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the left part of the inequality \(-2 < x^2\) is always true. Therefore, we only need to consider the right part:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we will use algebraic identities and substitutions.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
4 - 12 = -8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 3sp.
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
s^3 - 3sp + 8 = 0.
\]

Next, we use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We can factor this expression as:
\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = xy(x + y) + xz(x + z) + yz(y + z).
\]
Using the identity \(x + y + z = s\), we can rewrite it as:
\[
xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 12.
\]
Given that this expression equals 12, we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12.
\]
Solving for \(sp\), we get:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(s^3 - 3sp + 8 = 0\),
2. \(sp = 24\).

Substituting \(sp = 24\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
s^3 - 3 \cdot 24 + 8 = 0,
\]
\[
s^3 - 72 + 8 = 0,
\]
\[
s^3 - 64 = 0,

s^3 = 64,

\[
s = 4.

Now, substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(sp = 24\), we get:

p = 6.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the trapezoid, we need to analyze the given information and use the properties of the trapezoid.

The trapezoid has two sides that are 3 meters each (as indicated by the filled-in rectangle) and two semicircles with a diameter of 2 meters each. The perimeter of the trapezoid is given as 400 meters.

First, let's denote the lengths of the two parallel sides of the trapezoid as \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(a > b\)), and the height of the trapezoid as \(h\). The height \(h\) is equal to the diameter of the semicircles, which is 2 meters.

The perimeter of the trapezoid is the sum of the lengths of all its sides:
\[a + b + 2 \times 3 = 400\]
\[a + b + 6 = 400\]
\[a + b = 394\]

The area \(A\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[A = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h\]

\[A = \frac{1}{2} \times 394 \times 2\]

First, we need to find \(\cos{RST}\). Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we can use the Pythagorean identity to find \(\cos{R}\). The Pythagorean identity states that \(\sin^2{\theta} + \cos^2{\theta} = 1\). Substituting \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) into the identity, we get:

"To find the largest prime factor of the difference between the smallest positive integer and the largest positive integer on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to determine the range of \( y \) values for all real \( x \).

First, let's analyze the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \). The term \( x^2 - 3 \) is a quadratic function that opens upwards, and its minimum value occurs at \( x = 0 \). At \( x = 0 \), the value of \( y \) is:
\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
As \( x \) moves away from 0 in either direction, \( x^2 \) increases, and thus \( y \) increases without bound. Therefore, the range of \( y \) is \( \left[ -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}, \infty \right) \).

The smallest positive integer on the graph is the smallest positive integer greater than \( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Since \( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \approx -2.121 \), the smallest positive integer is 1.

The largest positive integer on the graph is unbounded, but for practical purposes, we consider the largest integer that is still on the graph. As \( x \) increases, \( y \) increases without bound, but the largest integer that is still on the graph is the largest integer less than or equal to the maximum value of \( y \) for some finite \( x \). However, since there is no upper bound, we consider the largest integer that is still on the graph for practical purposes, which is effectively the largest integer that is still on the graph for some finite \( x \).

The difference between the smallest positive integer and the largest positive integer on the graph is:
\[
1 - \left( \text{largest integer on the graph} \right)
\]
Since the largest integer on the graph is effectively the largest integer that is still on the graph for some finite \( x \), we consider the largest integer that is still on the graph for practical purposes, which is 1. Therefore, the difference is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the piecewise function \( f(x) \).

### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 0 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factor out \( x \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0
   \]
   Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]
   Factor the quadratic:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we have \( x = -1 \), but this also does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no solutions in this case.

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)

1. **Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. **Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( f(x) = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Let's test \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   -3^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) = -27 + 18 + 9 = 0 \neq 6
   \]
   Let's test \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2(4)^2 + 3(4) = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6
   \]
   Let's test \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   -5^3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5) = -125 + 50 + 15 = -60 \neq 6
   \]
   Since these values do not satisfy the equation, and given the complexity of solving the cubic equation, we conclude that there are no simple solutions in this case.

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Final Answer
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To determine the weight of the baseball that Jack can throw, we need to use the given information about the relationship between the weight of the ball and the force required to throw it. The problem states that the weight of the ball is proportional to the force required to throw it. This means that the ratio of the weight of the ball to the force required to throw it is constant.

Let's denote the weight of the ball by \( w \) and the force required to throw it by \( F \). According to the problem, the weight of the softball ball is 200 grams and the weight of the baseball is what we need to find. The force required to throw the softball ball is the same as the force required to throw the baseball, which is 150 grams.

We can set up the proportion based on the given information:
\[
\frac{w_{\text{softball}}}{F_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{w_{\text{baseball}}}{F_{\text{baseball}}}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\frac{200}{F_{\text{softball}}} = \frac{w_{\text{baseball}}}{150}
\]
Since the force required to throw the softball ball is the same as the force required to throw the baseball, we can say \( F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) grams. Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\frac{200}{150} = \frac{w_{\text{baseball}}}{150}
\]
To find \( w_{\text{baseball}} \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
200 \times 150 = 150 \times w_{\text{baseball}}
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
30000 = 150 \times w_{\text{baseball}}
\]
Solving for \( w_{\text{baseball}} \) by dividing both sides by 150:
\[
w_{\text{baseball}} = \frac{30000}{150} = 200

Therefore, the weight of the baseball that Jack can throw is \(\boxed{200}\) grams.","[200, '200']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine which digit is the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8, and then compare the digits.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits in the same positions:

- The first digit from the left in both representations is 1.
- The second digit from the left in base 7 is 5, and in base 8 is 1.
- The third digit from the left in base 7 is 5, and in base 8 is 6.
- The fourth digit from the left in base 7 is 6, and in base 8 is 5.

The only digit that is the same in both representations is the first digit, which is 1.

Thus, the digit that is the same in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",3,"[3, '3']",False

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to understand that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the greatest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}

Simplify the numerator and the denominator:

\[

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we know the following relationships among the roots:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. That is,

\[ S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \]
\[ S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \]
\[ S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3. \]

We know from Vieta's formulas that the sum of all pairwise products of the roots is zero:

\[ \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0. \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0. \]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can use the identity for the product of the roots taken three at a time:

\[ (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 \left( \frac{1}{\alpha_4} + \frac{1}{\alpha_3} + \frac{1}{\alpha_2} + \frac{1}{\alpha_1} \right)^2. \]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials. Let's assume the polynomial can be factored as:

\[ x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + ax + b)(x^2 + cx + d). \]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[ x^4 + (a+c)x^3 + (ac+b+d)x^2 + (ad+bc)x + bd. \]

By comparing coefficients with the original polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\), we get:

1. \(a + c = 2\)
2. \(ac + b + d = 0\)
3. \(ad + bc = 0\)
4. \(bd = 2\)

From the first equation, we have \(c = 2 - a\). Substituting \(c = 2 - a\) into the second equation, we get:

\[ a(2 - a) + b + d = 0 \implies 2a - a^2 + b + d = 0 \implies b + d = a^2 - 2a. \]

From the third equation, we have:

\[ ad + b(2 - a) = 0 \implies ad + 2b - ab = 0 \implies ad - ab = -2b \implies a(d - b) = -2b. \]

From the fourth equation, we have \(bd = 2\). Let's solve these equations. If we assume \(b = 1\) and \(d = 2\), then:

\[ 1 \cdot 2 = 2, \]
\[ 1 + 2 = a^2 - 2a \implies 3 = a^2 - 2a \implies a^2 - 2a - 3 = 0 \implies (a-3)(a+1) = 0. \]

So, \(a = 3\) or \(a = -1\). If \(a = 3\), then \(c = -1\), and if \(a = -1\), then \(c = 3\). Therefore, the factorization is:

\[ x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + 3x + 1)(x^2 - x + 2). \]

The roots of \(x^2 + 3x + 1 = 0\) are \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2\) and the roots of \(x^2 - x + 2 = 0\) are \(\alpha_3, \alpha_4\). Using the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ \alpha_1, \alpha_2 = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]
\[ \alpha_3, \alpha_4 = \frac{1 \pm \sqrt{-7}}{2} = \frac{1 \pm i\sqrt{7}}{2}. \]

Now, we can find \(S_1, S_2, S_3\):

\[ S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \left( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2} \right) = \frac{9 - 5}{4} + \frac{1 + 7}{4} = 1 + 2 = 3, \]
\[ S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = \left( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2} \right) = \frac{(-3 + \sqrt{5})(1 + i\sqrt{7}) + (-3 - \sqrt{5})(1 - i\sqrt{7})}{4} = \frac{-3 - 3i\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5} + i\sqrt{35} - 3 + 3i\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5} + i\sqrt{35}}{4} = \frac{-6 + 2i\sqrt{35}}{4} = -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2}, \]
\[ S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \left( \frac{-3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 - i\sqrt{7}}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{-3 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) \left( \frac{1 + i\sqrt{7}}{2} \right) = \frac{(-3 + \sqrt{5})(1 - i\sqrt{7}) + (-3 - \sqrt{5})(1 + i\sqrt{7})}{4} = \frac{-3 + 3i\sqrt{7} + \sqrt{5} - i\sqrt{35} - 3 - 3i\sqrt{7} - \sqrt{5} - i\sqrt{35}}{4} = \frac{-6 - 2i\sqrt{35}}{4} = -\frac{3}{2} - \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2}. \]

The product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) is:

\[ S_1 S_2 S_3 = 3 \left( -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2} \right) \left( -\frac{3}{2} - \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2} \right) = 3 \left( \left( -\frac{3}{2} \right)^2 - \left( \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2} \right)^2 \right) = 3 \left( \frac{9}{4} + \frac{35}{4} \right) = 3 \left( \frac{44}{4} \right) = 3 \cdot 11 = 33. \]

Therefore, the set \(\{S_1, S_2, S_3\}\) is \(\{3, -\frac{3}{2} + \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2}, -\frac{3}{2} - \frac{i\sqrt{35}}{2}\}\), and the product of the elements is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False
"To determine the cost of one pen and one Jumbo pencils, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one pen in dollars.
- Let \( j \) be the cost of one Jumbo pencil in dollars.

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( p + j = 1.24 \)
2. \( 2p + j = 1.82 \)

We can solve this system step by step. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( j \):
\[ (2p + j) - (p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 2p + j - p - j = 0.58 \]
\[ p = 0.58 \]

So, the cost of one pen is \( \$0.58 \). To find the cost of one Jumbo pencil, we substitute \( p = 0.58 \) back into the first equation:
\[ 0.58 + j = 1.24 \]
\[ j = 1.24 - 0.58 \]
\[ j = 0.66 \]

So, the cost of one Jumbo pencil is \( \$0.66 \). However, the problem asks for the cost of a single pen, which we have already determined to be \( \$0.58 \).

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's do the division step by step.

1. First, we note that 500 is larger than 137, so the integer part of the quotient is 0. We can write this as:
   \[
   137 \div 500 = 0. \text{(we need to find the decimal part)}
   \]

2. To find the decimal part, we can multiply 137 by 10 to get 1370, and then divide by 500:
   \[
   1370 \div 500 = 2.74
   \]
   Here, 500 goes into 1370 two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)), leaving a remainder of \(1370 - 1000 = 370\).

3. Next, we take the remainder 370 and multiply it by 10 to get 3700, and then divide by 500:
   \[
   3700 \div 500 = 7.4
   \]
   Here, 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)), leaving a remainder of \(3700 - 3500 = 200\).

4. Finally, we take the remainder 200 and divide by 500:
   \[
   200 \div 500 = 0.4
   \]
   Here, 500 goes into 200 zero times, and the remainder is 200, which is less than 500.

Combining all these parts, we get:
\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The digits in the decimal representation are 2, 7, and 4. The digit that is not zero is 7.

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to either of the sides \(AB\) or \(AD\).

First, let's establish the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\):
- \(A = (-a, a)\)
- \(B = (a, a)\)
- \(C = (a, -a)\)
- \(D = (-a, -a)\)

The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

Next, we need to find the regions within the rectangle where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any of the sides. The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the side \(AB\) (which is the line \(y = a\)) is:
\[
|y - a|
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the side \(AD\) (which is the line \(x = a\)) is:
\[

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < |y - a| \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < |x - a|
\]

Since \(x\) and \(y\) are both between \(-a\) and \(a\), we can simplify the absolute values:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < a - y \quad \text{and} \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < a - x
\]

Squaring both sides of these inequalities, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (a - y)^2 \quad \text{and} \quad x^2 + y^2 < (a - x)^2

Expanding and simplifying these inequalities:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < a^2 - 2ay + y^2 \implies x^2 < a^2 - 2ay
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < a^2 - 2ax + x^2 \implies y^2 < a^2 - 2ax
\]

Rearranging these inequalities:
\[
x^2 + 2ay < a^2 \quad \text{and} \quad y^2 + 2ax < a^2

These inequalities describe the region inside the rectangle where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the sides. This region is a smaller square centered at the origin with side length \(a\sqrt{2}\).

Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, the remainder is 0. Therefore, we can write:

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \), which is less than 4.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7 \), which is greater than 4, we use the first case of the function definition.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.7 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4, we use the first case of the function definition.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Next, we will find the sum of the second row:

\[
S = (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6

Since both expressions represent the same sum \( S \), we set them equal to each other:

Solving for \( n \):

The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify each term separately. Consider the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). We can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, but since \(\omega\) is a root of unity, we can use the property of cube roots of unity directly. Notice that:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{0 + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega^2}{1} = 1 + \omega^2
\]

Similarly, for the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\):

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1 + \omega}{(1 + \omega^2)(1 + \omega)} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega}{0 + 1} = \frac{1 + \omega}{1} = 1 + \omega
\]

Adding these two results together, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = (1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega) = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]

Since \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) (from the property of cube roots of unity), we have:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the maximum distance that can be traveled by moving from one of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) to another, passing through exactly two other points, we need to calculate the distances between all pairs of points and then find the maximum possible distance.

First, let's list the given distances:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We need to consider all possible paths that involve passing through exactly two other points. The possible paths and their distances are:
1. \(A \to B \to C \to D\)
2. \(A \to B \to D \to C\)
3. \(A \to C \to B \to D\)
4. \(A \to C \to D \to B\)
5. \(A \to D \to B \to C\)
6. \(A \to D \to C \to B\)
7. \(B \to A \to C \to D\)
8. \(B \to A \to D \to C\)
9. \(B \to C \to A \to D\)
10. \(B \to C \to D \to A\)
11. \(B \to D \to A \to C\)
12. \(B \to D \to C \to A\)
13. \(C \to A \to B \to D\)
14. \(C \to A \to D \to B\)
15. \(C \to B \to A \to D\)
16. \(C \to B \to D \to A\)
17. \(C \to D \to A \to B\)
18. \(C \to D \to B \to A\)
19. \(D \to A \to B \to C\)
20. \(D \to A \to C \to B\)
21. \(D \to B \to A \to C\)
22. \(D \to B \to C \to A\)
23. \(D \to C \to A \to B\)
24. \(D \to C \to B \to A\)

However, we can simplify this by calculating the distances for the direct paths and the paths that involve exactly two other points. The direct paths are:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

Now, let's consider the paths that involve exactly two other points:
- \(A \to B \to C \to D = AB + BC + CD = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15\)
- \(A \to B \to D \to C = AB + BD + DC = 5 + 3 + 4 = 12\)
- \(A \to C \to B \to D = AC + CB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\)
- \(A \to C \to D \to B = AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\)
- \(A \to D \to B \to C = AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 6 = 14\)
- \(A \to D \to C \to B = AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 6 = 15\)

From the above calculations, the maximum distance is 15. Therefore, the maximum distance that can be traveled is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",13,"[13, '13']",False
