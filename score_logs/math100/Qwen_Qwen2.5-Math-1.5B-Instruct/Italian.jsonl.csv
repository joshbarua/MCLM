"In the given right triangle \( \triangle DEF \), we know the following:
- \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \) (right angle)
- \( \sin D = 0.7 \)
- \( EF = 7 \)

We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin \theta = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In this case, \( \angle D \) is opposite to side \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DE \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE}
\]
Given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \), we substitute these values into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]

To solve for \( DE \), we rearrange the equation:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7}
\]

Next, we perform the division:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = \frac{7}{\frac{7}{10}} = 7 \times \frac{10}{7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \( DE \) is:

"To find the complex number \( w \) when \( z \) is rotated around \( c \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) in the clockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)
   \]
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + (- (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i)

   \[
   z' = \sqrt{2} - (3\sqrt{2} + 3 - 3)i
   \]
   \[
   z' = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) in the clockwise direction:**
   A clockwise rotation by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
   \[
   e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(-\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}}
   \]
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \left(-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \left(-i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)

   \[
   w = (4 - 4i) + (2 - 3i)

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this as:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}.\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) different ways.

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements**: Multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k) - 2k}
\]

Simplify the exponent of \(x\):

\[
3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-15}
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient and the powers:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10)^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} = 1000 \times -\frac{1}{8} = -125

Thus, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to determine if the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7. Let's substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression.

First, we calculate each term in the expression modulo 7:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 7k + 2 + 2 \equiv 7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 7k + 2 + 4 \equiv 7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 7k + 2 + 6 \equiv 7k + 8 \equiv 7k + 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we substitute these results back into the original expression:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 24 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify \( 24 \pmod{7} \):
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \implies 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \( 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \), the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is not divisible by 7. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees that a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center and still look the same.

The total degrees in a full rotation is 360 degrees. Since a regular pentagon has 5 sides, it can be rotated to 5 different positions that look the same. Therefore, the smallest angle of rotation that will make the pentagon coincide with its original position is the full rotation divided by the number of sides (or positions).

The calculation is as follows:
\[
\text{Minimum rotation} = \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Thus, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). This means we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the coordinates. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex \(D\) is such that the coordinates satisfy the condition \(x > 7\). Let's re-calculate the coordinates of \(D\) correctly.

The correct coordinates of \(D\) should be:
\[
D(8, 1)
\]

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 1 = 9
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",17,"[17, '17']",False

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero. The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero and the numerator is non-zero.

First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the function can be rewritten as:
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}. \]
The vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, which are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

First, observe that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be expressed as:

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues:
\[
\sigma_1 = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}, \quad \sigma_2 = \sqrt{\frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}}

The operator norm of \( A \) is the largest singular value:

In this problem, the base is 1 and the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number, but it is still an integer. Therefore, we can apply the property of exponents mentioned above directly:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), it follows that \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, we subtract the two base 10 numbers:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine how many trees are equivalent to the weight of one goolee, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the weight of one tree and one goolee.
2. Use the given information to find the weight of one tree in terms of the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we know:
- One tree has the same weight as three squigs and one goolee.
- One tree has the same weight as eight squigs.

Let's denote the weight of one tree as \( T \), the weight of one squig as \( S \), and the weight of one goolee as \( G \).

From the information given, we can write the following equations:
\[ T = 3S + G \]
\[ T = 8S \]

Since both expressions are equal to \( T \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[ 3S + G = 8S \]

To find the weight of one goolee in terms of the weight of one squig, we can solve for \( G \):
\[ G = 8S - 3S \]
\[ G = 5S \]

This tells us that the weight of one goolee is equal to the weight of five squigs. Therefore, the number of trees that are equivalent to the weight of one goolee is:
\[ \frac{G}{S} = \frac{5S}{S} = 5 \]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare coefficients.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately:

\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into equations 2 and 3:

For equation 2:

\[
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]

For equation 3:

\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8

Both equations are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical container, we need to use the information given about the volume of water added and the rate at which the price of water changes.

First, let's denote the radius of the cylindrical container by \( r \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. However, since the height is not given, we can use the information about the rate at which the price of water changes to find the radius.

The man buys water at a rate of 7 meters per hour, and the volume of water added per hour is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters. The price of water is 20 meters per hour, and the man buys water at a rate of 7 meters per hour. The net rate of change in the price of water is:
\[ 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ meters per hour} \]

The volume of water added per hour is the product of the rate of water addition and the height of the cylinder:
\[ 20\pi = \text{rate of water addition} \times \text{height of the cylinder} \]
\[ 20\pi = 7 \times h \]
\[ h = \frac{20\pi}{7} \text{ meters} \]

Now, we can use the volume formula of the cylinder to find the radius:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \left( \frac{20\pi}{7} \right) \]
\[ 20\pi = \frac{20\pi^2 r^2}{7} \]
\[ 20 = \frac{20\pi r^2}{7} \]
\[ 1 = \frac{\pi r^2}{7} \]
\[ 7 = \pi r^2 \]

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function at the point where the two pieces of the function meet, i.e., at \(x = a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{se } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{se } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

At \(x = a\), the value of the function from the left side (i.e., \(x < a\)) is:
\[ f(a^-) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

The value of the function from the right side (i.e., \(x \geq a\)) is:
\[ f(a^+) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

For the graph to intersect every vertical line at least once, the value of the function from the left side at \(x = a\) must be less than or equal to the value of the function from the right side at \(x = a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3. \]

Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]

To solve this inequality, we need to determine the intervals where the product \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is non-negative. The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

We test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the product in that interval:
- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 < 0\).
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0\).
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1-2)(1+1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 < 0\).
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3-2)(3+1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 > 0\).

The inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) is satisfied in the intervals \([-1, 0]\) and \([2, \infty)\). Since we are looking for the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph intersects every vertical line at least once, we take the maximum value in the interval \([2, \infty)\), which is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

We are given that the radius is 1, so:
\[ r = 1 \]
\[ r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The second solution \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is valid only if it lies in the interval \([0,1]\). This means:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
The left inequality is always true for \(\lambda > 0\). The right inequality gives:
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0,
\]
which is always true. Therefore, the only restriction is that \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which is true. If \(x = 1\), then \(f(f(1)) = 0\), which is not equal to 1. For \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 1\), the cubic equation must have a root in \((0,1)\). The discriminant of the cubic equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\) must be non-negative. However, a simpler approach is to consider the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and its fixed points.

For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). We need to check if there is an \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 4x(1 - x)(1 - x)^2 = 4x(1 - x)^3.
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
4x(1 - x)^3 = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
4(1 - x)^3 = 1 \implies (1 - x)^3 = \frac{1}{4} \implies 1 - x = \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{4}} \implies x = 1 - \frac{1}{\sqrt[3]{4}}.
\]
This value of \(x\) is in the interval \((0,1)\), so \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution.

For \(\lambda = 4\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2.
\]
The fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). We need to check if there is an \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 16x(1 - x)^3.
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
16x(1 - x)^3 = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
16(1 - x)^3 = 1 \implies (1 - x)^3 = \frac{1}{16} \implies 1 - x = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
This value of \(x\) is a fixed point, so \(\lambda = 4\) is not a solution.

Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is \(\lambda = 2\).

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Notice that:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine. Notice that:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

By simplifying further, we find that the expression simplifies to \(\tan 35^\circ\). Therefore, \(\theta = 35^\circ\).

"To determine how many digits the number \(42!\) has, we can use the property of logarithms. Specifically, the number of digits \(d\) of a number \(n\) is given by the formula:

\[ d = \lfloor \log_{10} n \rfloor + 1 \]

Here, \(n = 42!\). Therefore, we need to find \(\log_{10} (42!)\).

Using the property of logarithms that \(\log_{10} (a \cdot b) = \log_{10} a + \log_{10} b\), we can express \(\log_{10} (42!)\) as:

\[ \log_{10} (42!) = \log_{10} (1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdot \ldots \cdot 42) = \sum_{k=1}^{42} \log_{10} k \]

We can approximate this sum using the integral of \(\log_{10} x\) from 1 to 42. The integral of \(\log_{10} x\) is:

\[ \int \log_{10} x \, dx = \frac{x \log_{10} x - x}{\ln 10} \]

Evaluating this integral from 1 to 42, we get:

\[ \int_1^{42} \log_{10} x \, dx = \left[ \frac{x \log_{10} x - x}{\ln 10} \right]_1^{42} = \frac{42 \log_{10} 42 - 42}{\ln 10} - \frac{1 \log_{10} 1 - 1}{\ln 10} = \frac{42 \log_{10} 42 - 42 + 1}{\ln 10} = \frac{42 \log_{10} 42 - 41}{\ln 10} \]

Using the approximate values \(\log_{10} 42 \approx 1.6232\) and \(\ln 10 \approx 2.3026\), we get:

\[ \log_{10} (42!) \approx \frac{42 \cdot 1.6232 - 41}{2.3026} = \frac{68.1744 - 41}{2.3026} = \frac{27.1744}{2.3026} \approx 11.7999 \]

Therefore, the number of digits in \(42!\) is:

\[ d = \lfloor 11.7999 \rfloor + 1 = 11 + 1 = 12 \]

So, the number of digits in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{57}\).","[57, '57']",9,"[9, '9']",False
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
Now, we need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \).

To find the critical points of \( g(x) \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We also need to check the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

Now, we evaluate \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]

The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1, which occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is also 1, and it is achieved when \( x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, let's find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The vectors are:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated as follows:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The given equation then becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

This is equivalent to:

\[ 2 \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

So,

\[ \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2 \cos 85\theta \]

To find \( \cos 85\theta \), we need to determine the angle \( \theta \). The value \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a specific cosine value that corresponds to a particular angle. However, we can use the fact that \( \cos \theta \) is a root of a specific polynomial equation derived from the original equation. The polynomial equation for \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is:

\[ z^2 - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} z + 1 = 0 \]

The roots of this quadratic equation are:

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{2\sqrt{5} - 10}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{2\sqrt{5} - 10}}{4} \]

However, we can use the periodicity of the cosine function. Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we know that \( \cos 85\theta = \cos (85\theta \mod 360^\circ) \). Given the symmetry and periodicity of the cosine function, we can deduce that \( \cos 85\theta = \cos 34\theta \) because \( 85 \equiv 34 \pmod{360} \) in terms of the cosine function's periodicity. Since \( \cos 34\theta = \cos (360^\circ - 2\theta) = \cos 2\theta \), and knowing that \( \cos 2\theta = 2 \cos^2 \theta - 1 \), we get:

\[ \cos 2\theta = 2 \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right)^2 - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{16} \right) - 1 = 2 \left( \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{16} \right) - 1 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{8} - 1 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 8}{8} = \frac{-2 + 2\sqrt{5}}{8} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2 \cos 85\theta = 2 \left( \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \right) = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]

"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of the centroid and the fact that the line passing through the centroid and parallel to one side of the triangle divides the other two sides proportionally.

1. **Identify the properties of the centroid and the line parallel to \(BC\):**
   - The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.
   - A line passing through the centroid and parallel to one side of the triangle divides the other two sides proportionally. This means that if the line is parallel to \(BC\) and intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), then \(M\) and \(N\) divide \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively in the ratio 2:1.

2. **Determine the area of \(\triangle WMN\):**
   - Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the line \(MN\) divides \(\triangle ABC\) into two regions: a smaller triangle \(\triangle WMN\) and a trapezoid \(BMNC\).
   - The smaller triangle \(\triangle WMN\) is similar to \(\triangle ABC\) because \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\). The ratio of the sides of \(\triangle WMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is 1:3 (since \(G\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio, and \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and divides \(AB\) and \(AC\) in the ratio 2:1).
   - The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle WMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

3. **Calculate the area of \(\triangle WMN\):**
   - The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle WMN\) is \(\frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16\).

"In a sequence of arithmetic progression (AP), the difference between consecutive terms is constant. Let's denote the first term of the sequence by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

Given:
- The 5th term (\(a_5\)) is 200.
- The 8th term (\(a_8\)) is 500.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]

Using the information given:
\[ a_5 = a + 4d = 200 \]
\[ a_8 = a + 7d = 500 \]

We can set up a system of linear equations:
1. \( a + 4d = 200 \)
2. \( a + 7d = 500 \)

To find \(d\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 3d = 300 \]
\[ d = 100 \]

Now, substitute \(d = 100\) back into the first equation to find \(a\):

\[ a + 400 = 200 \]
\[ a = 200 - 400 \]
\[ a = -200 \]

Now that we have \(a = -200\) and \(d = 100\), we can find the 6th term (\(a_6\)):
\[ a_6 = a + 5d \]

"To determine how many integers between 100 and 150 are multiples of both 100 and 150, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of 100 and 150 and then identify the multiples of this LCM that fall within the given range.

First, let's find the LCM of 100 and 150. The prime factorizations of 100 and 150 are:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:

Clearly, the only multiple of 300 that lies between 100 and 150 is 300 itself, but 300 is not between 100 and 150. Therefore, there are no integers between 100 and 150 that are multiples of both 100 and 150.

We need to find the number of nickels, \( n \). To do this, we need to express \( n \) in terms of \( d \):

"To determine the smallest multiple of 450 that ends in 2 zeros, we need to understand that a number ending in 2 zeros is a multiple of 100. Therefore, we need to find the smallest multiple of 450 that is also a multiple of 100.

First, let's find the least common multiple (LCM) of 450 and 100. We start by finding the prime factorizations of the two numbers:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[ \text{LCM} = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 9 \times 25 = 900 \]

So, the smallest multiple of 450 that ends in 2 zeros is 900. To verify, we can divide 900 by 450:
\[ 900 \div 450 = 2 \]
Since 2 is an integer, 900 is indeed a multiple of 450.

"To determine the probability that the coin is in a winning position in a game of chance, we need to analyze the conditions given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The first number rolled determines the remainder when divided by 4, which can be 1, 2, or 3.
   - The second number rolled determines the remainder when divided by 5, which can be 1, 2, 3, or 4.
   - The coin is in a winning position if the sum of the remainders is 5.

2. **Identifying the Winning Combinations:**
   - We need to find all pairs \((a, b)\) where \(a\) is the remainder when the first number is divided by 4, and \(b\) is the remainder when the second number is divided by 5, such that \(a + b = 5\).
   - The possible values for \(a\) are 1, 2, and 3.
   - The possible values for \(b\) are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
   - Let's list the pairs \((a, b)\) that satisfy \(a + b = 5\):
     - If \(a = 1\), then \(b = 4\).
     - If \(a = 2\), then \(b = 3\).
     - If \(a = 3\), then \(b = 2\).
   - So, the winning pairs are \((1, 4)\), \((2, 3)\), and \((3, 2)\).

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Possible Outcomes:**
   - There are 3 possible values for \(a\) and 4 possible values for \(b\).

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ

We can group the terms as follows:

(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)

This can be rewritten as:

\[

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to express \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). However, we can also use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines. The product of sines can be simplified using the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

This result can be derived using the multiple angle formulas or complex numbers, but for the sake of this problem, we will use this known result. Therefore, the original expression becomes:

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

1. **Understanding Cylindrical Coordinates**:
   - \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
   - \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
   - \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

2. **Interpreting the Equation \(z = c\)**:
   - The equation \(z = c\) means that for any point in space, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).
   - This describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and is located at a constant height \(c\) above the \(xy\)-plane.

3. **Visualizing the Shape**:
   - If we fix \(z = c\), the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\) can vary freely, meaning that the equation describes an infinite set of points that lie on a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane at height \(c\).
   - This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, making it a flat, two-dimensional surface.

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the cross product.

Given:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2, \quad \|\mathbf{b}\| = 7, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Next, we substitute the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\):
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:
\[

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The function \( g(x) \) is defined as:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

To find the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to solve:
\[ g(x) = 0 \]
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]

Let \( y = x + 5 \). Then:
\[ f(y) = 0 \]

The roots of \( f(y) = 0 \) are the same as the roots of \( f(x) = 0 \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are obtained by shifting the roots of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

Let the roots of \( f(x) = 0 \) be \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Then the roots of \( g(x) = 0 \) are:
\[ \alpha - 5, \beta - 5, \gamma - 5 \]

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean identity for secant and tangent:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity to \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]

Now, consider the expression \(\csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ\). Using the Pythagorean identity for cosecant and cotangent:
\[
\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta
\]
we have:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Adding these together:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ) = 2 + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Now, we combine all parts of the original expression:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (2 + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Simplify the expression:
\[
= 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 2 + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

To find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\), we use the known trigonometric identity:
\[
\tan^2 \theta + \cot^2 (90^\circ - \theta) = \tan^2 \theta + \tan^2 \theta = 2 \tan^2 \theta
\]

However, this identity is not directly applicable here. Instead, we use the known result from trigonometric tables or advanced trigonometric identities that:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12

"To determine if Qu bi lati could have a convex polygon with the sum of all but one of its interior angles being \(1070^\circ\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = 180(n-2)
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(x\) be the measure of the one interior angle that is not \(1070^\circ\). The sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is then:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]
   According to the formula for the sum of the interior angles, we have:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x = 180(n-2)
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 180(n-2) - 1070
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for \(x\):**
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < x < 180
   \]
   Substitute the expression for \(x\) into this inequality:
   \[
   0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   0 < 180(n-2) - 1070
   \]
   Add 1070 to both sides:
   \[
   1070 < 180(n-2)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Now, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
   \]
   Add 1070 to both sides:
   \[
   180(n-2) < 1250
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

6. **Combine the results:**
   From the two parts of the inequality, we get:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, \(n = 8\).

7. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   180(8-2) = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), then the measure of the remaining angle is:
   \[
   1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
   \]
   Since \(10^\circ\) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, the solution is correct.

Therefore, Qu bi lati could have a convex polygon with the sum of all but one of its interior angles being \(1070^\circ\). The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( t \) such that \( t \) is odd, \( 0 < t < 23 \), and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

First, let's rewrite the congruence:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By checking the squares of the integers from 1 to 22, we find that:
\[ 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -18 \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]

We need to check which of these solutions are odd and satisfy the original conditions. Both 17 and 4 are odd, but we need to check if they satisfy \( t + 2 \) being the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
We need to check if 19 is the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23. This means we need to check if:
\[ 17 \cdot 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Since \( 323 = 14 \cdot 23 + 1 \), we have:
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, 19 is indeed the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23.

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
We need to check if 6 is the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23. This means we need to check if:
\[ 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
Since \( 24 = 1 \cdot 23 + 1 \), we have:
\[ 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, 6 is indeed the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23.

Both 17 and 4 are valid solutions, but the problem asks for an odd integer. Both 17 and 4 are odd, so either one is a valid solution. However, typically in such problems, we look for the smallest positive solution, which is 17.

Therefore, the solution is:

We need to find the 2003rd term of the sequence. Substituting the values of \(a_1\) and \(d\) into the formula, we get:

\[a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2\]

First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[2003 - 1 = 2002\]

Next, multiply 2002 by 2:

\[2002 \cdot 2 = 4004\]

Finally, add 1 to 4004:

\[1 + 4004 = 4005\]

Therefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence is \(\boxed{4005}\).","[4005, '4005']",4005,"[4005, '4005']",True
"Per find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

First, we calculate \( f(5) \):
\[

\[

Next, we subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by simplifying the expression inside the sine function.

First, recall that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\). This is because if \(\theta = \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right)\), then \(\cot \theta = \frac{1}{x}\), which implies \(\tan \theta = x\), so \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\). Therefore, the equation simplifies to:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( 2 \tan^{-1} (x) \right).
\]
We know that \(\sin (2 \theta) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta\). Let \(\theta = \tan^{-1} (x)\), so \(\sin \theta = \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\) and \(\cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}}\). Then:
\[
\sin (2 \tan^{-1} (x)) = 2 \sin \theta \cos \theta = 2 \left( \frac{x}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+x^2}} \right) = \frac{2x}{1+x^2}.
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\frac{2x}{1+x^2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\]
To solve for \(x\), we cross-multiply to get:
\[
6x = 1 + x^2.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a quadratic equation:
\[
x^2 - 6x + 1 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -6\), and \(c = 1\):
\[
x = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{36 - 4}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm \sqrt{32}}{2} = \frac{6 \pm 4\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \pm 2\sqrt{2}.
\]
Thus, the solutions are \(x = 3 + 2\sqrt{2}\) and \(x = 3 - 2\sqrt{2}\). The problem asks for the sum of the solutions, so we add these two values:
\[
(3 + 2\sqrt{2}) + (3 - 2\sqrt{2}) = 6.

"To determine if the two lines are parallel and to find the distance between them, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check if the lines are parallel:**
   Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, the lines are parallel.

2. **Find the distance between the lines:**
   The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:
   \[
   d = \frac{\left| \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \right|}{\left\| \mathbf{d} \right\|}
   \]
   where \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

   Let \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). The direction vector \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

   First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):
   \[
   \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}
   \]

   Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\):
   \[
   \left\| \mathbf{d} \right\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
   \]

   Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):
   \[
   \left| \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \right| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-7)^2 + (-5)^2} = \sqrt{64 + 49 + 25} = \sqrt{138}

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

We know from the problem statement that:

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on a circle.
   - We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Insight:**
   - For two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment crosses the other.
   - This happens if and only if the points are arranged in an alternating order, i.e., the points can be labeled in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations).

3. **Counting the Total Arrangements:**
   - The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of distinct cyclic permutations of 4 points, which is \((4-1)! = 3! = 6\).

4. **Counting the Favorable Arrangements:**
   - We need to count the number of ways to arrange the points such that the segments intersect.
   - There are exactly 2 such arrangements for each set of 4 points: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\).

   - The probability is the ratio of the number of favorable arrangements to the total number of arrangements.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric configuration and the relationship between the areas of the shapes involved. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the shapes and their areas:**
   - We have a circle with radius \( r = 1 \) and a square inscribed in it with side length \( s = \sqrt{2} \).
   - The area of the circle is \( \pi r^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi \).
   - The area of the square is \( s^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2 \).

2. **Understand the given condition:**
   - The area of the region ombre (the area of the circle minus the area of the square) is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle.
   - The area of the region ombre is \( \pi - 2 \).
   - According to the problem, \( \pi - 2 = \frac{5}{12} \pi \).

3. **Solve for \( \pi \):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \( \pi \):
     \[
     \pi - \frac{5}{12} \pi = 2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{12}{12} \pi - \frac{5}{12} \pi = 2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{7}{12} \pi = 2
     \]
     \[
     \pi = \frac{24}{7}
     \]
   - This step is just to verify the consistency of the problem's setup, but we don't need the exact value of \( \pi \) to find the angle.

4. **Determine the angle \( \angle ADC \):**
   - The problem states that the area of the region ombre is \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle, which implies that the angle \( \angle ADC \) must be such that the area of the ombre is consistent with this condition.
   - The angle \( \angle ADC \) is the angle subtended by the arc of the circle that forms the ombre. Since the ombre is the area of the circle minus the area of the square, the angle \( \angle ADC \) must be such that the area of the ombre is \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the circle.
   - The angle \( \angle ADC \) is \( 90^\circ \) because the square is inscribed in the circle, and the angle subtended by the arc of the circle that forms the ombre is \( 90^\circ \).

Therefore, the angle \( \angle ADC \) is \(\boxed{90}\).","[90, '90']",120,"[120, '120']",False
"To determine how many of the becher d'acids are needed to fill a spherical beaker with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the becher d'acids and the spherical beaker and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the becher d'acids. The becher d'acids is a cylinder with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm. The volume \( V_{\text{cylinder}} \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Substituting the given values:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical beaker. The volume \( V_{\text{sphere}} \) of a sphere is given by the formula:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. Substituting the given radius of 6 cm:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cm}^3
\]

Now, we need to find out how many becher d'acids are required to fill the spherical beaker. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical beaker by the volume of one becher d'acids:
\[
\text{Number of becher d'acids} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4

Therefore, the number of becher d'acids needed to fill the spherical beaker is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcomittees and then subtracting the number of subcomittees that do not meet the requirement (i.e., those that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 members from the 14 members (8 from the first party and 6 from the second party). This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the first party (which has 8 members) and the number of ways to choose 5 members all from the second party (which has 6 members).

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6

The number of subcomittees that do not meet the requirement (all members from one party) is the sum of the two combinations calculated above.

\[
\binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} = 56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract the number of subcomittees that do not meet the requirement from the total number of subcomittees to get the number of subcomittees that include at least one member from each party.

\[
\binom{14}{5} - \left( \binom{8}{5} + \binom{6}{5} \right) = 2002 - 62 = 1940

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting equation for \(x\).

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

Now, solve for \(x\) by taking the square root of both sides. Remember that taking the square root gives us both the positive and negative roots:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

x = 64 + 2 = 66

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and the altitude \(AM = 11\), and point \(D\) is on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), and \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

In triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}.\]

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BAC = \theta\), we can use the fact that \(\angle BDC\) is an external angle to triangle \(BDM\) at \(D\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle MDC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta\). Let \(\angle MDC = \alpha\). Then:
\[3\theta = 90^\circ - \theta + \alpha \implies \alpha = 4\theta - 90^\circ.\]

Now, consider triangle \(BDM\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\), \(AD = 10\) and \(DM = 1\), we have:
\[BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}.\]

Using the Law of Sines in triangle \(BDM\):
\[\frac{BD}{\sin(90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{DM}{\sin(4\theta - 90^\circ)} \implies \frac{\sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{-\cos 4\theta} \implies \sqrt{x^2 + 1} = -\cos \theta \cdot \frac{1}{\cos 4\theta}.\]

Using the double-angle and triple-angle identities, we get:
\[\cos 4\theta = 8\cos^4 \theta - 8\cos^2 \theta + 1.\]
Let \(y = \cos \theta\). Then:
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 1} = -y \cdot \frac{1}{8y^4 - 8y^2 + 1}.\]

Since \(\cos 4\theta = 2\cos^2 2\theta - 1 = 2(2\cos^2 \theta - 1)^2 - 1 = 8\cos^4 \theta - 8\cos^2 \theta + 1\), we have:
\[\sqrt{x^2 + 1} = -y \cdot \frac{1}{8y^4 - 8y^2 + 1}.\]

By solving the equation, we find that \(x = 5\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 10\), and \(AB = AC = \sqrt{11^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{121 + 25} = \sqrt{146} = 13\).

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:

   The sum of 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as:
   \[
   S = n + (n+1) + (n+2) + \cdots + (n+26)
   \]
   This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(n\) and the last term \(n+26\). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{\text{number of terms}}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})

   S = \frac{27}{2} \times (n + (n+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2n + 26) = 27 \times (n + 13)
   \]
   We know that the sum is \(3^7\), so:
   \[
   27 \times (n + 13) = 3^7
   \]
   Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   3^3 \times (n + 13) = 3^7

   Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's consider the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\). Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative because it is a sum of squares. Specifically, we can rewrite it as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = x^2(x^2 + 4).\]
Since \(x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), and \(x^2 + 4 > 0\) for all real \(x\), it follows that \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\).

Now, let's analyze the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), the left part of the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true because \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) is greater than \(-4\). Therefore, we only need to focus on the right part of the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 < 21.\]

To find the values of \(x\) that satisfy this inequality, we need to solve the equation:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = 21.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y = 21.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have:
\[x^2 = 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[x = \pm \sqrt{3}.\]
This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the previous equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, consider the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.

This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = 12,

We can factor this as:
\[
xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y) = xy(y+z) + xz(x+y) + yz(x+y).
\]
We can use the identity:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
or
\[
12 = sp - 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s \left( s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s} \right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s \left( s^2 - \frac{72}{s} \right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
or
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine the degree at which the number of 9th Graders who take the bus is more expensive than 135% of the number of 10th Graders who take the bus, we need to calculate the number of 9th Graders and 10th Graders who take the bus for each degree and compare them.

Let's denote the number of 9th Graders who take the bus as \( M_9 \) and the number of 10th Graders who take the bus as \( M_{10} \). We need to find the degree where \( M_9 > 1.35 \times M_{10} \).

The number of 9th Graders who take the bus is given by:
\[ M_9 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \]
Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 123.3 to 123.

The number of 10th Graders who take the bus is given by:
\[ M_{10} = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \]
Rounding 103.2 to the nearest whole number, we get 103.

Now, we need to check if \( M_9 > 1.35 \times M_{10} \):
\[ 1.35 \times 103 = 139.05 \]
Since 123 is less than 139.05, the 9th Graders do not meet the condition for the 10th Degree.

Next, let's check the 11th Degree. The number of 11th Graders who take the bus is:
\[ M_{11} = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \]
Rounding 61.8 to the nearest whole number, we get 62.

The number of 10th Graders who take the bus is still 103. Now, we need to check if \( M_{11} > 1.35 \times M_{10} \):
\[ 1.35 \times 103 = 139.05 \]
Since 62 is less than 139.05, the 11th Graders do not meet the condition for the 11th Degree.

Finally, let's check the 12th Degree. The number of 12th Graders who take the bus is:
\[ M_{12} = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \]
Rounding 34.8 to the nearest whole number, we get 35.

The number of 10th Graders who take the bus is still 103. Now, we need to check if \( M_{12} > 1.35 \times M_{10} \):
\[ 1.35 \times 103 = 139.05 \]
Since 35 is less than 139.05, the 12th Graders do not meet the condition for the 12th Degree.

Since the 9th Graders do not meet the condition for the 10th Degree and the 11th and 12th degrees also do not meet the condition, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to check the degrees in reverse order, starting from the 10th Degree and going backwards.

For the 10th Degree, we already calculated that \( M_{10} = 103 \) and \( M_{11} = 62 \). Since 62 is less than 139.05, the 11th Graders do not meet the condition for the 10th Degree.

For the 11th degree, we already calculated that \( M_{11} = 62 \) and \( M_{12} = 35 \). Since 35 is less than 139.05, the 12th Graders do not meet the condition for the 11th degree.

Therefore, the correct degree is the 10th Degree, where the number of 9th Graders who take the bus is less than 135% of the number of 10th Graders who take the bus.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the area of the largest possible field, we need to maximize the area of the shape described, which consists of a rectangle with two semicircles on its ends. The total perimeter of the field is given as 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of the semicircles.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width of the rectangle (which is also the diameter of the semicircles) by \( W \). The perimeter of the field can be expressed as the sum of the lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2\pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \frac{\pi W}{2} \), so the total perimeter is:

\[ L + L + \frac{\pi W}{2} + \frac{\pi W}{2} = 2L + \pi W = 400 \]

We can solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ 2L + \pi W = 400 \]
\[ 2L = 400 - \pi W \]
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \), and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{W^2}{4} = \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \), so the total area of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{\pi W^2}{8} = \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \). Therefore, the total area \( A \) is:

\[ A = L W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]
\[ A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{2\pi W^2}{4} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]
\[ A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]

To find the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:

\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0 \]
\[ 200 = \frac{\pi W}{2} \]
\[ W = \frac{400}{\pi} \]

Now we substitute \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):

\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \times \frac{400}{\pi} \]
\[ L = 200 - 200 \]
\[ L = 100 \]

Finally, we substitute \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) into the area formula:

\[ A = 100 \times \frac{400}{\pi} + \frac{\pi \left( \frac{400}{\pi} \right)^2}{4} \]
\[ A = \frac{40000}{\pi} + \frac{\pi \times 160000}{4\pi^2} \]
\[ A = \frac{40000}{\pi} + \frac{40000}{\pi} \]
\[ A = \frac{80000}{\pi} \]

1. **Identify the sides of the triangle:**
   - Since \(\angle RST\) is a right angle, \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\).
   - Let \(ST = 5\) (the hypotenuse).
   - Let \(RS = 2\) (the side opposite \(\angle R\)).

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RT\):**

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the curve given by the equation \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Substituting \( y \) from the curve equation into the distance function, we get:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

Expanding the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[ D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we can minimize the function inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

This gives us the critical points \( x = 0 \) and \( x = \pm \sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

For \( x = 0 \):

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]

For \( x = \sqrt{2} \) and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \), so the minimum value of \( D \) is:

\[ D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \]

Thus, the minimum distance from the origin to the curve is \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), and we have \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0.
   \]
   We can factor out \( x \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0.
   \]
   The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this range. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( f(x) = 0 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.
   \]
   We need to solve the cubic equation:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0.
   \]
   By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0.
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). We need to check if there are any other real roots, but since we are only interested in the real root in the domain \( x > 3 \), we can conclude that there are no real roots in this domain.

So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

"Given that the distances from a point \( P \) to five of the vertices of a regular octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's recall the structure of a regular octahedron. It has 8 faces, 12 edges, and 6 vertices. The vertices can be divided into two sets of 4 vertices each, with each set forming a tetrahedron and the two sets being orthogonal to each other. If we place the octahedron in a coordinate system with vertices at \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\), then the distance between any two vertices is either \(\sqrt{2}\) or 2.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A = (1, 0, 0) \), \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \), \( C = (0, 1, 0) \), \( D = (0, -1, 0) \), \( E = (0, 0, 1) \), and \( F = (0, 0, -1) \). The distance from \( P \) to these vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance to the sixth vertex.

Since the octahedron is symmetric, the distances from \( P \) to the vertices must satisfy the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that are not adjacent is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices. This is a consequence of the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

Let's denote the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex as \( x \). The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 324 + x^2. \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices that are not adjacent is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices. This means that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to any four vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the other two vertices.

Therefore, we have:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = 121 + x^2. \]
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 = 204 = 121 + x^2. \]
\[ x^2 = 83. \]
\[ x = \sqrt{83}. \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{66},[],False

Given that both Jack and Jen apply the same force to their balls, we can set up the equation for each case and then compare the accelerations.

First, let's denote the force applied by both Jack and Jen as \(F\).

For the p left by the softball:
- Mass of the softball (\(m_{\text{softball}}\)) = 200 g = 0.2 kg
- Acceleration of the softball (\(a_{\text{softball}}\)) = \(a_{\text{softball}}\)

Using Newton's second law:
\[ F = m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]
\[ F = 0.2 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} \]

For the p left by the baseball:
- Mass of the baseball (\(m_{\text{baseball}}\)) = 150 g = 0.15 kg
- Acceleration of the baseball (\(a_{\text{baseball}}\)) = \(a_{\text{baseball}}\)

Using Newton's second law:
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]
\[ F = 0.15 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

Since the force \(F\) is the same for both the softball and the baseball, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
\[ 0.2 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 0.15 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the accelerations, we solve for \(a_{\text{softball}}\) in terms of \(a_{\text{baseball}}\):
\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{0.15}{0.2} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]
\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{15}{20} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]
\[ a_{\text{softball}} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

This means that the acceleration of the softball is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the acceleration of the baseball. Therefore, the acceleration of the baseball is \(\frac{4}{3}\) times the acceleration of the softball.

First, let's convert \(121_3\) to base 10:
\[
121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}

Now, we need to find the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\).

\[

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

Now, we compare the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\):
- Base 7: \(1556_7\)
- Base 8: \(1165_8\)

We see that the numbers \(121_3\) and \(413_5\) are not the same as the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\). Therefore, the number of common digits between the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is 0.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), where \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) and \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we can use a useful property of polynomials. The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \), which is the same as \( f(0) \) because \( g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0) \).

Now, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \):

"Per determinare la distanza fromo $(6, 0)$ all'retta $y = 2x - 2$, usate la formula per la distanza fromo a un segmento. Distances from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a line $Ax + By + C = 0$ are given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line $y = 2x - 2$ in the standard form $Ax + By + C = 0$. 

Starting with $y = 2x - 2$, we rearrange it to:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, $A = 2$, $B = -1$, and $C = -2$. The point is $(6, 0)$. Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) - 2 = 12 - 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is $|10| = 10$. Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the distance is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by $\sqrt{5}$:

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point $(6, 0)$ to the line $y = 2x - 2$ is:

"Given the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we know that the roots are \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\). By Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\[

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\).

First, let's consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\). This polynomial can be derived from the original polynomial by considering the product of the roots taken two at a time. The polynomial is:
\[
P(x) = x^6 - (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)x^5 + \cdots.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\), the polynomial simplifies to:
\[
P(x) = x^6 + \cdots.
\]

Now, we need to find the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time for the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these roots by \(A = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(B = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(C = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). We need to find \(A + B + C\).

We know that:
\[
A + B + C = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
A + B + C = \alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4.
\]
Using the fact that \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we can substitute \(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - \alpha_1\). Therefore:
\[
A + B + C = \alpha_1(-2 - \alpha_1) + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4.
\]
We know that \(\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4}{\alpha_1} = \frac{2}{\alpha_1}\). Therefore:
\[
A + B + C = -2\alpha_1 - \alpha_1^2 + \frac{2}{\alpha_1}.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\) is a root of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(\alpha_1^4 + 2\alpha_1^3 + 2 = 0\), or \(\alpha_1^4 = -2\alpha_1^3 - 2\). This implies that \(\alpha_1^3 = -2 - \frac{2}{\alpha_1}\). Substituting this into the expression for \(A + B + C\), we get:
\[
A + B + C = -2\alpha_1 - \left(-2 - \frac{2}{\alpha_1}\right) + \frac{2}{\alpha_1} = -2\alpha_1 + 2 + \frac{2}{\alpha_1} + \frac{2}{\alpha_1} = -2\alpha_1 + 2 + \frac{4}{\alpha_1}.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\) is a root of the polynomial, we can use the fact that the sum of the roots taken one at a time is \(-2\). Therefore, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is 0, and the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time is 0. This implies that the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is 0. Therefore, the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time is 0.

"Let's define the variables for the prices of the items:

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:

We can solve this system step by step. First, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( G \):

\[ 2M + G - M - G = 0.58 \]

"To find the last digit of the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we first need to convert the fraction into its decimal form. We do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \( A = (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) \), \( B = (\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}) \), \( C = (\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}) \), and \( D = (-\frac{1}{2}, -\frac{1}{2}) \). The center \( O \) of the rectangle is at the origin \( (0, 0) \).

The distance from \( O \) to any vertex is the same, which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, the distance from \( O \) to any of the vertices \( A, B, C, \) or \( D \) is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Now, let's consider the distance from \( O \) to the fifth vertex. Since \( O \) is the center of the rectangle, the distance from \( O \) to any vertex is the same. Therefore, the distance from \( O \) to the fifth vertex is also \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Since the distance from \( O \) to any of the vertices is the same, the probability that \( O \) is closer to one of the four vertices than to the fifth vertex is 1, because \( O \) is equidistant from all five vertices.

\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.047 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:

- Connie: \$26.52

First, we add the amounts step by step:

1. Add Linda's and Sherry's amounts:

\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\

\]

We will start by finding the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, we will check the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this must also equal \( S \), we set up the equation:
\[

\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

To verify, we will check the sum of the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
And the sum of the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 7 - 3 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the main diagonal:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the other diagonal:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 8 + 14 - 9 + 2 = 15

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 = 1\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify each term in the expression. We start with \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). Using the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can rewrite \(1 + \omega\) as \(-\omega^2\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2}.
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). Similarly, we can rewrite \(1 + \omega^2\) as \(-\omega\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Now, we substitute these simplified forms back into the original expression:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) is \(\omega^3\). Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\frac{\omega}{\omega^3} - \frac{\omega^2}{\omega^3} = -\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{1} = -(\omega + \omega^2).
\]

Using the relation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Therefore, we have:
\[
-(\omega + \omega^2) = -(-1) = 1.

"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled to visit all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to find the shortest Hamiltonian path in the given graph. A Hamiltonian path is a path that visits each vertex exactly once.

The given graph is a complete graph with four vertices, and the edge weights are as follows:
- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 3\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(BD = 4\)
- \(CD = 5\)

We will consider all possible Hamiltonian paths and calculate their total distances. There are \(3! = 6\) possible permutations of the vertices after choosing the starting vertex. We will start from each vertex and calculate the total distance for each permutation.

1. Starting from \(D\):
   - \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(5 + 5 + 6 = 16\)
   - \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(5 + 6 + 3 = 14\)
   - \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)

2. Starting from \(A\):
   - \(A \to D \to B \to C\): \(3 + 3 + 6 = 12\)
   - \(A \to D \to C \to B\): \(3 + 3 + 6 = 12\)
   - \(A \to B \to D \to C\): \(5 + 5 + 5 = 15\)
   - \(A \to B \to C \to D\): \(5 + 6 + 3 = 14\)
   - \(A \to C \to D \to B\): \(6 + 5 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(A \to C \to B \to D\): \(6 + 6 + 3 = 15\)

3. Starting from \(B\):
   - \(B \to A \to D \to C\): \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - \(B \to A \to C \to D\): \(5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - \(B \to D \to A \to C\): \(4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)
   - \(B \to D \to C \to A\): \(4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   - \(B \to C \to D \to A\): \(6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
   - \(B \to C \to A \to D\): \(6 + 6 + 3 = 15\)

4. Starting from \(C\):
   - \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
   - \(C \to A \to D \to B\): \(6 + 3 + 4 = 13\)
   - \(C \to A \to B \to D\): \(6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
   - \(C \to B \to D \to A\): \(6 + 4 + 3 = 13\)
   - \(C \to B \to A \to D\): \(6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)

From the above calculations, the shortest distance is 12, which occurs for the paths \(D \to A \to B \to C\) and \(D \to B \to C \to A\).

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled to visit all four points exactly once is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",13,"[13, '13']",False
