"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \). We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In this triangle, \( \angle D \) is opposite to side \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DF \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Solving for \( DF \), we get:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \( DE \). The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \( DE \) is \( \boxed{\sqrt{51}} \).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that lies on a circle centered at \( c = 2 - 3i \) with radius \( |z - c| \) and makes an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) with the positive real axis, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance \( |z - c| \):**

   Given:
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

   The distance \( |z - c| \) is:
   \[
   |z - c| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2} - 2)^2 + (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}) - (-3))^2}
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the square root:
   \[
   |z - c| = \sqrt{(\sqrt{2})^2 + (-3\sqrt{2})^2}
   \]
   \[
   |z - c| = \sqrt{2 + 18}
   \]
   \[
   |z - c| = \sqrt{20}
   \]
   \[
   |z - c| = 2\sqrt{5}
   \]

2. **Express \( w \) in polar form:**

   Since \( w \) lies on a circle centered at \( c \) with radius \( 2\sqrt{5} \) and makes an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) with the positive real axis, we can write:
   \[
   w = c + 2\sqrt{5} \left( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin\frac{\pi}{4} \right)
   \]

3. **Calculate the real and imaginary parts of \( w \):**

   Using the values of \( \cos\frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \sin\frac{\pi}{4} \):
   \[
   \cos\frac{\pi}{4} = \sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

   Substitute these values into the expression for \( w \):
   \[
   w = (2 - 3i) + 2\sqrt{5} \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   w = (2 - 3i) + 2\sqrt{5} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (1 + i)
   \]
   \[
   w = (2 - 3i) + \sqrt{10} (1 + i)
   \]

4. **Distribute and combine like terms:**

   Distribute \( \sqrt{10} \):
   \[
   w = 2 - 3i + \sqrt{10} + i\sqrt{10}
   \]
   Combine the real and imaginary parts:
   \[
   w = (2 + \sqrt{10}) + i(\sqrt{10} - 3)
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:
\[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this as:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = \sqrt{11^2} \times \sqrt{2} = 11 \sqrt{2}.\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the term where the power of \(x\) is zero. Let's simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the powers of \(x\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Now, combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3}
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
(-1)^3 = -1
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \times -\frac{100}{8} = 10 \times -12.5 = -125

\[

\[

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) as described in the problem.

First, let's factor the denominator of the function:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the function can be rewritten as:
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}. \]

The function has vertical asymptotes where the denominator is zero, which occurs at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). These are the values of \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, we have:
\[ a = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad b = -2. \]

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote of the function. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) where the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is:
\[ y = 0. \]
This means that as \( x \) approaches infinity or negative infinity, \( f(x) \) approaches 0. Therefore, the value of \( c \) is:
\[ c = 0. \]

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use a mathematical trick that simplifies the calculation. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to compute. Specifically, we can recognize that this expression is a factorization of a polynomial.

The expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten as:
\[
99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1}
\]
This is because the polynomial \(x^2 + x + 1\) is a factor of \(x^3 - 1\), and we can use the identity:
\[
x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)
\]
Setting \(x = 99\), we get:
\[
99^3 - 1 = (99 - 1)(99^2 + 99 + 1)
\]
So,
\[

Now, we need to calculate \(99^3\). We can do this by breaking it down:
\[

\[
99^3 = 99 \times 9801 = 970299

So,
\[

This involves finding the operator norm of the matrix \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). Here, \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\). Therefore, the value of \( C \) is \( 4 \).

"To solve the problem, we start by identifying the roots of the equation \(z^5 = 1\). These roots are the fifth roots of unity, which are given by \(z = e^{2\pi i k / 5}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). Since we are given that \(z \neq 1\), we exclude \(k = 0\), which corresponds to \(z = 1\). Therefore, the possible values for \(z\) are \(e^{2\pi i / 5}\), \(e^{4\pi i / 5}\), \(e^{6\pi i / 5}\), and \(e^{8\pi i / 5}\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\) and \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.\]

Next, we use the fact that the sum of all fifth roots of unity is zero. The fifth roots of unity are \(1, z, z^2, z^3, z^4\), and their sum is:
\[1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0.\]
Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get:
\[z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = -1.\]
Thus, the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\) is:
\[z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 = -1.\]

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
\]

So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]
Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

Sum of the polynomials:

We are given that this sum is equal to:
\[12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\]

Since the polynomials on both sides must be equal, we compare the coefficients of the corresponding terms:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) on the left side is 0 (since there are no \(t^4\) terms in the given polynomial), and on the right side, it is 12. This is a contradiction, so there must be a mistake in the problem statement or interpretation.

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) are equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a(a^2) = a^3.
\]

Since the function is continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1.

However, we need to check which of these values are valid. If \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[
f(x) =

0 & \text{if } x < 0,
\end{cases}
\]
which is a constant function and is continuous everywhere. However, the problem states that \(a\) is a positive number, so \(a = 0\) is not a valid solution.

If \(a = 2\), the function becomes:

\]

If \(a = -1\), the function becomes:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1,\\
-x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1,

which is not continuous at \(x = -1\) because:
\[
\lim_{x \to -1^-} f(x) = -(-1) - 2 = -1, \quad \lim_{x \to -1^+} f(x) = -(-1)^2 = -1, \quad f(-1) = -(-1)^2 = -1.

"To solve the given problem, we need to rewrite the equation \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\) in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). This process involves completing the square for both the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\]

First, we complete the square for the \(x\) terms. The expression \(x^2 - 10x\) can be written as:
\[x^2 - 10x = (x-5)^2 - 25\]

Next, we complete the square for the \(y\) terms. The expression \(y^2 + 6y\) can be written as:
\[y^2 + 6y = (y+3)^2 - 9\]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
\[(x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\]

Simplifying this, we have:
\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\). The radius of the circle is therefore \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

The problem asks for the value of \(c\) such that the circle has a radius of 5. Therefore, we set the radius equal to 5:
\[\sqrt{34 - c} = 5\]

Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:
\[34 - c = 25\]

Solving for \(c\), we subtract 25 from 34:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) has no fixed points in the interval \([0,1]\) and satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f(x)\). A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\), so we solve:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality simplifies to:
\[
0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies 1 \leq \lambda \leq 2.
\]
So, for \(\lambda\) in the interval \([1,2]\), the function \(f(x)\) has a fixed point at \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,1)\), the function \(f(x)\) has no fixed points in \([0,1]\).

Next, we need to check if \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\) when \(\lambda\) is in the interval \([0,1)\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This equation must hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\). Let's check specific values of \(x\):
1. For \(x = 1\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - 1)(1 - \lambda + \lambda) = 0 \neq 1.
\]
This shows that \(f(f(x)) = x\) cannot hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\) if \(\lambda\) is in the interval \([0,1)\).

Therefore, the only values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the conditions are in the interval \([1,2]\). The answer is:

\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
and
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B).
\]

However, the terms in the numerator do not directly fit these forms. Instead, we can use the product-to-sum identities:

\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A + B) + \cos (A - B)]
\]
and
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A - B) - \cos (A + B)].
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ]
\]
and
\[
\sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ].
\]

Similarly,

\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ]
\]
and
\[
\sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ].
\]

Substituting these into the numerator, we have:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ + \cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ - \cos 15^\circ + \cos 25^\circ - \cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ].
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the product-to-sum identities again, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ]
\]
and
\[
\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ]
\]

Similarly,

\[
\cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ]
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ].
\]

Substituting these into the denominator, we have:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ - \sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ + \sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ - \sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ].
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 15^\circ = \sin 75^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 75^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Since \(\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ\) and \(\sin 75^\circ = \cos 15^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Finally, we recognize that the numerator and denominator are equal, so:

\[
\tan \theta = 1.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\theta\) is:

\[
\boxed{45^\circ}.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime \(5\), we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (e.g., \(5^3 = 125\)) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Therefore, the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9

Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) and the domain is a square of side length 2 centered at the origin.

To find the maximum value, we can consider the boundary values and critical points. Let's first check the boundary values. If \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} = 0 \) or \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 \), respectively, which makes the function zero. Similarly, if \( x = -1 \) or \( y = -1 \), the function is also zero. So, the boundary values do not give us the maximum value.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
We need to maximize \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Evaluating \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]
Similarly,
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1. \]
So, the maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is also 1.

To confirm that this is indeed the maximum value, we can check the second derivative or use the fact that the function is continuous and differentiable in the given domain, and the maximum value must occur either at a critical point or on the boundary. Since the boundary values are zero and the critical points give the value 1, the maximum value of the function is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices at \(O(0,0,0)\), \(A(1,2,3)\), and \(B(-3,-2,1)\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
So, the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number that satisfies the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this quadratic equation are the golden ratio and its conjugate, \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and \( \overline{\phi} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), we can assume \( z = \phi \) or \( z = \overline{\phi} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). First, we note that \( \phi \) and \( \overline{\phi} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 = z + 1 \), which implies \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) can be expressed in terms of \( \phi \) and \( \overline{\phi} \).

The sequence \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) satisfies the recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n, \]
where \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). The initial conditions are \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \phi + \frac{1}{\phi} = \phi + \overline{\phi} = 1 + \sqrt{5} \).

We need to find \( a_{85} \). The sequence \( a_n \) is the same as the Fibonacci sequence shifted by one index, i.e., \( a_n = F_{n+1} \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, \( a_{85} = F_{86} \).

The 86th Fibonacci number is 196418. Thus, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

"Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 square units, we need to find the area of triangle \(GHI\), where \(G\), \(H\), and \(I\) are the points of intersection of the cevians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) respectively, and these cevians are concurrent at the centroid \(G\) of the triangle.

The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of places where the number of places is given by the sum of the given numbers, specifically for the places where the number of places is $200$ and $500$.

First, let's identify the places where the number of places is $200$ and $500$. According to the problem, the places where the number of places is $200$ are given by the sum of the places where the number of places is $200$ and $500$.

The number of places where the number of places is $200$ is $200$.
The number of places where the number of places is $500$ is $500$.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the number of divisors of \( n \) is \( 2^{24} \). Let's denote \( n \) in its prime factorized form as:
\[ n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \]
The number of divisors of \( n \) is given by the formula:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \]
We need this product to equal \( 2^{24} \). Since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, each term in the product \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\) must also be a power of 2. Therefore, each \( e_i + 1 \) must be a power of 2. Let's set \( e_i + 1 = 2^{a_i} \), where \( a_i \) are non-negative integers. Then we have:
\[ e_i = 2^{a_i} - 1 \]
The sum of all \( a_i \) must be 24 because:
\[ (2^{a_1} - 1) + (2^{a_2} - 1) + \cdots + (2^{a_k} - 1) = 2^{24} \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 2^{a_1} + 2^{a_2} + \cdots + 2^{a_k} - k = 2^{24} \]
To minimize \( n \), we should use the smallest possible values for \( a_i \). The smallest values for \( a_i \) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 16 (since \( 2^{16} + 2^{16} = 2^{17} \) is too large, we use 16 twice and the rest as 1). Therefore, we have:
\[ a_1 = 16, a_2 = 16, a_3 = 2, a_4 = 2, a_5 = 2, a_6 = 2, a_7 = 2, a_8 = 2, a_9 = 2, a_{10} = 2, a_{11} = 2, a_{12} = 2, a_{13} = 2, a_{14} = 2, a_{15} = 2, a_{16} = 2, a_{17} = 2, a_{18} = 2, a_{19} = 2, a_{20} = 2, a_{21} = 2, a_{22} = 2, a_{23} = 2, a_{24} = 2 \]
This gives us:
\[ e_1 = 2^{16} - 1, e_2 = 2^{16} - 1, e_3 = 2 - 1, e_4 = 2 - 1, e_5 = 2 - 1, e_6 = 2 - 1, e_7 = 2 - 1, e_8 = 2 - 1, e_9 = 2 - 1, e_{10} = 2 - 1, e_{11} = 2 - 1, e_{12} = 2 - 1, e_{13} = 2 - 1, e_{14} = 2 - 1, e_{15} = 2 - 1, e_{16} = 2 - 1, e_{17} = 2 - 1, e_{18} = 2 - 1, e_{19} = 2 - 1, e_{20} = 2 - 1, e_{21} = 2 - 1, e_{22} = 2 - 1, e_{23} = 2 - 1, e_{24} = 2 - 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of words in the given context. Let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the key information in the problem:
   - The problem states that the number of words in the context is 75.
   - It also mentions that the number of words in the context is the same as the number of words in the word ""� _____"".

2. The word ""� _____"" is a placeholder for the unknown number of words. Since the problem states that the number of words in the context is 75, we can infer that the number of words in the word ""� _____"" is also 75.

Therefore, the number of words in the word ""� _____"" is \(\boxed{75}\).","[75, '75']",7,"[7, '7']",True

"Given the linear equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we need to find the value of \(b\) when \(a = 4\). Here, \(a\) and \(b\) are the coordinates of a point on the line, so we can substitute \(x = 4\) into the equation and solve for \(y\).

Starting with the equation:
\[3x + 2y = 12\]

Substitute \(x = 4\):
\[3(4) + 2y = 12\]

Simplify the left side:
\[12 + 2y = 12\]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \(y\):
\[2y = 0\]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(y\):
\[y = 0\]

Since \(y = b\), we have:
\[b = 0\]

Thus, the value of \(b\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in the given diagram. The diagram consists of a rectangle with two triangles inside it. The rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. The two triangles are right triangles, one with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units, and the other with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units.

First, let's calculate the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the first triangle:
\[
\text{Area of the first triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}
\]

Now, let's calculate the area of the second triangle:
\[
\text{Area of the second triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

The total area of the two triangles is:
\[
\text{Total area of the triangles} = 6 + 4 = 10 \text{ square units}
\]

The area of the shaded region is the area of the rectangle minus the area of the two triangles:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = 12 - 10 = 2 \text{ square units}
\]

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\boxed{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word "" mango "" such that the letters ' m ' and ' a ' are always together. We can treat the pair ' ma ' as a single unit or block. This reduces the problem to arranging the units ' m a ' and the letters ' o ' and ' k '.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Treat ' ma ' as a single unit**: This means we are now arranging the units ' m a ' (or ' a m '), ' o ' and ' k '.
2. **Count the number of units**: We have 3 units to arrange: ' m a ' (or ' a m '), ' o ' and ' k '.
3. **Calculate the number of arrangements**: The number of ways to arrange 3 units is given by the factorial of 3, which is \(3!\).

\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

4. **Consider the two possible orders of ' m ' and ' a '**: ' ma ' and ' a m ' are two different arrangements of the same block. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of arrangements of the units by 2.

\[

So, the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word "" mango "" such that the letters ' m ' and ' a ' are always together is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to simplify the expression \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) and express it in the form \(\frac{a}{b}\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are coprime integers.

First, let's factorize the numerator 4321. We can check if 4321 is divisible by small prime numbers:

- 4321 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 4321 is \(4 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3, so 4321 is not divisible by 3.
- 4321 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- To check divisibility by 7, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 7 \approx 617.2857\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 7.
- To check divisibility by 11, we use the alternating sum of the digits: \(4 - 3 + 2 - 1 = 2\), which is not divisible by 11, so 4321 is not divisible by 11.
- To check divisibility by 13, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 13 \approx 332.3846\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 13.
- To check divisibility by 17, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 17 \approx 254.1765\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 17.
- To check divisibility by 19, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 19 \approx 227.4211\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 19.
- To check divisibility by 23, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 23 \approx 187.8696\), which is not an integer, so 4321 is not divisible by 23.
- To check divisibility by 29, we perform the division: \(4321 \div 29 \approx 149\), which is an integer, so 4321 is divisible by 29. Performing the division, we get \(4321 = 29 \times 149\).

Now, we need to check if 149 is a prime number. We check divisibility by prime numbers up to \(\sqrt{149} \approx 12.2\):

- 149 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, or 11 (as we have already checked the small prime numbers and 149 is not divisible by any of them).

Since 149 is not divisible by any prime number less than its square root, 149 is a prime number. Therefore, the factorization of 4321 is \(4321 = 29 \times 149\).

Now, we substitute this factorization into the original expression:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{29 \times 149}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}
\]

Since 29, 149, 5, and 2 are all prime numbers and do not share any common factors, the fraction is already in its simplest form. Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\frac{29 \times 149}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}
\]

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{4321}{78125000}}

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify the expression. This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to express \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). However, we can use another approach by considering the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of sines of angles in the form \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). This gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Since \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

Thus, the value of the given expression is:

"Given the magnitudes of vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) are \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), respectively, and their cross product is \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by the formula:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), where \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). This means we need to solve the equation \( f(x + 5) = 0 \).

First, let's express \( f(x + 5) \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015. \]

We don't need to expand this expression fully. Instead, we can use the fact that if \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( f(x + 5) \). This is because if \( f(r) = 0 \), then \( f((r - 5) + 5) = f(r) = 0 \).

So, the roots of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) are the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted by \(-5\). Let's denote the roots of \( f(x) \) by \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

To find the roots of \( f(x) \), we can use the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational root of the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \) is a factor of the constant term \(-2015\) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient \(1\). The factors of \(-2015\) are \( \pm 1, \pm 5, \pm 13, \pm 31, \pm 65, \pm 155, \pm 403, \pm 2015 \).

By testing these possible roots, we find that \( x = 5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \):
\[ f(5) = 5^3 - 49 \cdot 5^2 + 623 \cdot 5 - 2015 = 125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015 = 0. \]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a root. We can now perform polynomial division of \( f(x) \) by \( x - 5 \) to find the other roots. Using synthetic division, we get:
\[ f(x) = (x - 5)(x^2 - 44x + 403). \]

Next, we solve the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 44x + 403 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -44 \), and \( c = 403 \):
\[ x = \frac{44 \pm \sqrt{(-44)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 403}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{44 \pm \sqrt{1936 - 1612}}{2} = \frac{44 \pm \sqrt{324}}{2} = \frac{44 \pm 18}{2}. \]
So, the roots are:
\[ x = \frac{44 + 18}{2} = 31 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{44 - 18}{2} = 13. \]

Therefore, the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( 5, 13, \) and \( 31 \). Shifting these roots by \(-5\), the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( 5 - 5 = 0 \), \( 13 - 5 = 8 \), and \( 31 - 5 = 26 \).

Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( \boxed{0, 8, 26} \).","[{0, 8, 26}, '0, 8, 26']",34,"[34, '34']",False
"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean identity for secant and tangent:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity to \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]

Similarly, for \(\csc^2 20^\circ\) and \(\csc^2 40^\circ\), we use the identity for cosecant:
\[
\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta
\]
Thus:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Now, substitute these into the original expression:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Combine the constants:
\[
= 1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the identity for cotangent in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}
\]
Thus:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

We need to find a way to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\). Notice that:
\[
\tan 20^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 10^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \tan (30^\circ + 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ + \tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]

However, these identities are complex to handle directly. Instead, we use a known result from trigonometric identities:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} = 12
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 12 = 15
\]

\boxed{15}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). The formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6
\]

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

\[
n = 8
\]

So, the polygon has 8 sides. The answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the conditions given and translate them into a mathematical equation. The conditions are:

1. The time \( t \) is between 0 and 23 hours.
2. The time \( t + 2 \) is also between 0 and 23 hours.
3. The time \( t + 2 \) is equivalent to \( t \) modulo 23, meaning \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \).

Let's analyze the third condition. The condition \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \) simplifies to \( 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), which is not true for any \( t \) in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \). However, this condition is actually asking for a time \( t \) such that adding 2 hours to it results in the same time modulo 23. This means that \( t \) must be such that \( t + 2 \) is exactly 23 hours away from \( t \) in a circular manner. This can only happen if \( t \) is 21, because \( 21 + 2 = 23 \), and 23 is equivalent to 0 modulo 23, but since we are considering the time in a 24-hour format, 23 hours is the same as 0 hours, and thus 23 hours after 21 hours is the same as 0 hours after 21 hours, which is 21 hours.

Therefore, the only value of \( t \) that satisfies all the conditions is \( t = 21 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{21}\).","[21, '21']",17,"[17, '17']",False

"To determine if the two lines intersect, we need to find if there exist values of \( t \) and \( u \) such that the parametric equations of the two lines are equal. The parametric equations of the lines are:

This gives us a system of three equations:

1. \( 3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \)
2. \( -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \)
3. \( 1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \)

We will solve these equations step by step.

First, let's simplify each equation:

1. \( 3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \)
   \[
   2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}

2. \( -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \)

- The length of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(5 - (-5) = 10\).
- The width of the rectangle is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(4 - (-4) = 8\).

The area \(A\) of the rectangle is given by the formula:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The cross product of two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) is given by \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\). The distributive property states that \((\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}\) and \((\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} (\mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{w}) - \mathbf{v} (\mathbf{u} \cdot \mathbf{w})\).

First, we expand the expression \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\):

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\). Therefore, we can substitute these values into the expression:

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

"Given the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisecting \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the area of \(\triangle ACD\) as \(x\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid. The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\). Let the area of \(\triangle ABC\) be \(y\). Therefore, we have:
\[
x + y = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is given by:
\[
x = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AC \cdot CD
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABD\) is isosceles with \(AB = AD\). However, we do not need this information to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Instead, we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the area of \(\triangle ACD\) because they share the same height from \(A\) to \(\overline{BC}\) and the same base length (since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\) and the height is the same for both triangles when considering the trapezoid as a whole).

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is also \(x\). Therefore, we have:
\[
y = x

Substituting \(y = x\) into the equation \(x + y = 42\), we get:
\[
x + x = 42

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:

   - The arc \( AC \) subtends an angle of \( \frac{5}{12} \) radians at the center of the circle.

2. **Understand the relationship between the arc and the angle:**

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the number of places of precision: The statement says ""the number of places of precision is 2"" and ""the number of places of precision is 20."" This seems contradictory, but we need to consider the context. The number of places of precision is typically the number of significant figures or decimal places. Since the statement is about precision, we should consider the number of significant figures.

2. Determine the number of significant figures: The number of significant figures is the number of digits that are known with certainty plus one digit that is uncertain. In this case, the statement says ""20 places,"" which means there are 20 digits in the number. However, the number of places of precision is 2, which means there are only 2 significant figures. This implies that the number is written in a way that only the first 2 digits are significant.

3. Construct the number: If the number has 20 digits but only 2 significant figures, it means the number is written in a way that the first 2 digits are the only ones that matter.

   \left(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4}\right)^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. **Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0

4. **Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   For the equation \(x^2 - 4x - 4092 = 0\), the coefficients are \(a = 1\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -4092\).

5. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-4092) = 16 + 16368 = 16384
   \]

6. **Find the square root of the discriminant:**
   \[
   \sqrt{16384} = 128

7. **Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:**
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm 128}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4 \pm 128}{2}
   \]

8. **Solve for the two possible values of \(x\):**
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 128}{2} = \frac{132}{2} = 66
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62
   \]

9. **Verify the solutions:**
   - For \(x = 66\):
     \[
     \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16
     \]
     This solution is incorrect.

   - For \(x = -62\):
     \[
     \sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16
     \]
     This solution is also incorrect.

Since both solutions do not satisfy the original equation, there are no real solutions to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we need to find the length of \( BC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( BC = 2x \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have \( BM = MC = x \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

Now, consider \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \). Since \( D \) lies on \( BC \), we can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \).

In \( \triangle ABD \):
\[
\frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB}
\]
In \( \triangle ACD \):
\[
\frac{AD}{\sin \angle ACD} = \frac{AC}{\sin \angle ADC}
\]
Since \( AB = AC \) and \( \angle ABD = \angle ACD \), we have:
\[
\frac{10}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ADB}
\]
\[
\frac{10}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{AC}{\sin \angle ADC}
\]
Since \( \angle ADB + \angle ADC = 180^\circ \), we have \( \sin \angle ADB = \sin \angle ADC \). Therefore:
\[
AB = AC
\]

Next, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
\angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle DBC - \angle DCB
\]
\[
3\theta = 180^\circ - 2 \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)
\]
\[
3\theta = 180^\circ - (180^\circ - \theta)
\]
\[
3\theta = \theta
\]
\[
2\theta = 0
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle.

Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[
AD^2 = AB^2 + BD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot BD \cdot \cos \angle ABD
\]
\[
10^2 = AB^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot x \cdot \cos \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)
\]
\[
100 = AB^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot x \cdot \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ACD \):
\[
AD^2 = AC^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot CD \cdot \cos \angle ACD
\]
\[
10^2 = AC^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot x \cdot \cos \left( \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \right)
\]
\[
100 = AC^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot AC \cdot x \cdot \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

Since \( AB = AC \), we have:
\[
100 = AB^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot x \cdot \sin \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)
\]

Using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we can use the triple angle formula for cosine:
\[
\cos 3\theta = 4 \cos^3 \theta - 3 \cos \theta
\]

\[
x = 10

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) can be factored as \(x^2(x^2 + 4)\). This expression is always non-negative because \(x^2 \geq 0\) and \(x^2 + 4 > 0\) for all real \(x\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\).

Given that \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), the left part of the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, we only need to focus on the right part of the inequality: \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\).

To find the range of \(x\) that satisfies \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we can make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). Rearranging terms, we get:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]

Next, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the roots. Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us the roots:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the positive root \(y = 3\). Therefore, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is satisfied for \(0 \leq y < 3\). Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

\[

\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the second given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we get:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}) = s^3 - 72.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

\[
\text{Area of the square} = \text{side length}^2 = 2^2 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, we calculate the area of one quarter-circle. The area of a full circle with radius 1 unit is:
\[
\text{Area of a full circle} = \pi \times \text{radius}^2 = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi \text{ square units}

Since each quarter-circle is one-fourth of a full circle, the area of one quarter-circle is:

There are four quarter-circles in the diagram, so the total area of the four quarter-circles is:

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\). We need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

First, let's rewrite the given equation:

We can distribute the \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) inside the parentheses:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \]

To simplify \(\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\), we rationalize the denominator:

So the equation becomes:

We can rewrite \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) as \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\):
\[ y = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} x^2 - \frac{3 \sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, we can factor out \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) from the entire equation:

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.

   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = \frac{2}{-2} = -1 \) (not valid since \( x > 3 \)) and \( x = \frac{-6}{-2} = 3 \) (not valid since \( x > 3 \)). Therefore, there are no solutions for \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.

   Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.

   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. By trial, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not a solution since it is not greater than 3. We can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions for \( x > 3 \) that satisfy this equation.

So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

The total weight of the 150-gram coins is:

Adding these two amounts together gives the total weight of all the coins:
\[ 20000 + 15000 = 35000 \text{ grams} \]

Next, we need to find the total number of coins. Since there are 100 coins of each type, the total number of coins is:
\[ 100 + 100 = 200 \]

The average weight per coin is the total weight divided by the total number of coins:

"To solve the problem, we need to convert the given numbers from their respective bases to base 10, perform the required operations, and then convert the result back to the required base if necessary. Let's break it down step by step.

First, let's convert \(121_3\) to base 10:
\[121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}\]

Next, let's convert \(413_5\) to base 10:
\[413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 1 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 1 = 100 + 5 + 3 = 108_{10}\]

Now, we need to add these two base 10 numbers:
\[16_{10} + 108_{10} = 124_{10}\]

Finally, we need to convert \(124_{10}\) back to base 5. To do this, we repeatedly divide the number by 5 and keep track of the remainders:
\[124 \div 5 = 24 \text{ remainder } 4\]
\[24 \div 5 = 4 \text{ remainder } 4\]
\[4 \div 5 = 0 \text{ remainder } 4\]

"To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given statements and determine the truth value of each statement. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Statement:**
   - ""itudes of the first 100 natural numbers are all even.""
   - The first 100 natural numbers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 100.
   - The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S = \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \), where \( n = 100 \).
   - So, \( S = \frac{100 \cdot 101}{2} = 5050 \).
   - Since 5050 is an even number, the sum of the first 100 natural numbers is even.
   - Therefore, the first statement is true.

2. **Second Statement:**
   - ""The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is odd.""
   - From the previous calculation, we know that the sum of the first 100 natural numbers is 5050, which is even.
   - Therefore, the second statement is false.

3. **Third Statement:**
   - ""The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is a multiple of 5.""
   - From the previous calculation, we know that the sum of the first 100 natural numbers is 5050.
   - To check if 5050 is a multiple of 5, we divide 5050 by 5: \( 5050 \div 5 = 1010 \).
   - Since 1010 is an integer, 5050 is a multiple of 5.
   - Therefore, the third statement is true.

4. **Fourth Statement:**
   - ""The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is a multiple of 10.""
   - From the previous calculation, we know that the sum of the first 100 natural numbers is 5050.
   - To check if 5050 is a multiple of 10, we divide 5050 by 10: \( 5050 \div 10 = 505 \).
   - Since 505 is an integer, 5050 is a multiple of 10.
   - Therefore, the fourth statement is true.

5. **Fifth Statement:**
   - ""The sum of the first 100 natural numbers is a multiple of 20.""
   - From the previous calculation, we know that the sum of the first 100 natural numbers is 5050.
   - To check if 5050 is a multiple of 20, we divide 5050 by 20: \( 5050 \div 20 = 252.5 \).
   - Since 252.5 is not an integer, 5050 is not a multiple of 20.
   - Therefore, the fifth statement is false.

When we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get \( f(x-1) \). The degree of a polynomial is the highest power of the variable in the polynomial. Since \( f(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 4 (the highest power of \( x \) in \( f(x) \) is 4), substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) will not change the degree of the polynomial.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the point on the line \( y = 2x - 2 \) that is closest to the point \( (6, 0) \). The shortest distance from a point to a line is along the perpendicular dropped from the point to the line.

1. **Find the slope of the given line:**
   The equation of the line is \( y = 2x - 2 \). The slope of this line is \( m_1 = 2 \).

2. **Find the slope of the perpendicular line:**
   The slope of the line perpendicular to the given line is the negative reciprocal of \( m_1 \). Therefore, the slope of the perpendicular line is \( m_2 = -\frac{1}{2} \).

3. **Write the equation of the perpendicular line passing through the point \( (6, 0) \):**
   Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, \( y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \), we get:
   \[
   y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)

4. **Find the intersection of the two lines:**
   To find the intersection of the lines \( y = 2x - 2 \) and \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \), we set the equations equal to each other:
   \[
   2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3

   \[
   5x - 4 = 6

   Add 4 to both sides:
   \[
   5x = 10

   Substitute \( x = 2 \) back into the equation \( y = 2x - 2 \):

Let the roots be \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\).

By Vieta's formulas, we know:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:

\]
This implies:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\). The polynomial can be written as:
\[
P(x) = (x - \alpha_1\alpha_2)(x - \alpha_1\alpha_3)(x - \alpha_1\alpha_4)(x - \alpha_2\alpha_3)(x - \alpha_2\alpha_4)(x - \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
The sum of the roots of this polynomial taken two at a time is given by the coefficient of \(x^4\) term, which is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. This sum is:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we have:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + 2 = -2,

which simplifies to:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4.
\]

We also know that the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time is zero. Therefore, we have:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -4.
\]

From the above, we can deduce that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0,
\]
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 4.

The possible values for \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 + 4t^2 + 4t + 4 = 0\). By solving this polynomial, we find that the roots are \(t = -2, -1 \pm i\). Therefore, the values of \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are \(-2, -1+i, -1-i\).

Thus, the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) are \(\boxed{-2, -1+i, -1-i}\).","[{-2, -i - 1, i - 1}, '-2, -1+i, -1-i']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the pen, given the costs of two other items and the total cost of all three items. Let's denote the cost of the pen as \( P \).

We are given:
1. The cost of the first item is \$1.24.
2. The cost of the second item is \$1.82.
3. The total cost of all three items is \$3.00.

We can set up the following equation to represent the total cost:
\[ 1.24 + 1.82 + P = 3.00 \]

First, we add the costs of the first two items:
\[ 1.24 + 1.82 = 3.06 \]

Now, we substitute this sum back into the equation:
\[ 3.06 + P = 3.00 \]

To find \( P \), we subtract 3.06 from both sides of the equation:
\[ P = 3.00 - 3.06 \]
\[ P = -0.06 \]

However, this result is not possible because the cost of an item cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct interpretation should be that the total cost of the three items is \$3.06, not \$3.00. Therefore, the correct equation should be:
\[ 1.24 + 1.82 + P = 3.06 \]

Now, we solve for \( P \):
\[ 3.06 + P = 3.06 \]
\[ P = 3.06 - 3.06 \]
\[ P = 0 \]

This result indicates that there is an error in the problem statement or the interpretation. Given the problem as stated, the correct interpretation should be that the total cost of the three items is \$3.06, not \$3.00. Therefore, the cost of the pen is:

"To solve the problem, we need to convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Understand the Fraction**: The fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) means 137 divided by 500.

2. **Perform the Division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. This can be done using long division or a calculator.

   - Using long division:
     - 500 goes into 137 zero times, so we write 0 before the decimal point.
     - We then consider 1370 (by adding a decimal point and a zero).
     - 500 goes into 1370 two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)).
     - Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
     - Bring down another zero to make it 3700.
     - 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)).
     - Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
     - Bring down another zero to make it 2000.
     - 500 goes into 2000 four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)).
     - Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

   - Therefore, the division gives us \(0.274\).

3. **Verify the Result**: We can verify the result by multiplying \(0.274\) by 500 to see if we get back to 137.

We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point \(P\) inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) lies within the circle centered at \(O\) with radius \(OA\). Since \(O\) is the center of the rectangle, the radius of the circle is half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle.

The length of the diagonal \(AC\) (or \(BD\)) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:

\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), which is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \), which is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's find the sum of the first row:

\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:

Since the sum of each row must be the same, we have:

(n+1) + (2n-9) + (n-3) = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-3) = 8 + 5 + 4 = 15
\]
Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the number of pages in the first book to the number of pages in the second book. Let's denote the number of pages in the first book as \( P_1 \) and the number of pages in the second book as \( P_2 \).

From the problem, we know:
- The first book has 300 pages.
- The second book has 400 pages.

The ratio of the number of pages in the first book to the number of pages in the second book is given by:
\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{P_1}{P_2} = \frac{300}{400}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 100:
\[
\frac{300 \div 100}{400 \div 100} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the number of pages in the first book to the number of pages in the second book is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity satisfying \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). We can use the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) to express \(\omega^2\) in terms of \(\omega\):
\[
\omega^2 = -1 - \omega.
\]
Now, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), so the numerator simplifies to:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Next, we need to simplify the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
So, the value is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). The quadrilateral can be divided into two triangles: \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\). We will calculate the area of each triangle separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find the area of \(\triangle ABD\). The vertices of \(\triangle ABD\) are \(A(-3, 3)\), \(B(3, 0)\), and \(D(0, 0)\). The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \left| -3(0 - 0) + 3(0 - 3) + 0(3 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 9 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -9 \right| = \frac{9}{2}
\]

Next, let's find the area of \(\triangle BCD\). The vertices of \(\triangle BCD\) are \(B(3, 0)\), \(C(0, -4)\), and \(D(0, 0)\). Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3(-4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 + 0 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 \right| = 6
\]

Now, we add the areas of the two triangles to get the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\):
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \text{Area of } \triangle ABD + \text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{9}{2} + 6 = \frac{9}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = \frac{21}{2} = 10.5
\]

Therefore, the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(\boxed{10.5}\).","[10.5000000000000, '10.5']",13,"[13, '13']",False
