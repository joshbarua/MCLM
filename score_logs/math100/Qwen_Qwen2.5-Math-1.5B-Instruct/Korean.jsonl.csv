"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \). We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In this triangle, \( \angle D \) is opposite to side \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DE \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
We are given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \( DE \), we solve for \( DE \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DE \) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \( DE \) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""8 gettye"" such that the letters ""per"" are together. We can treat ""per"" as a single unit or ""block,"" which simplifies the problem.

1. **Treat ""per"" as a single unit:**
   The word ""8 gettye"" can be thought of as ""8 get(ye per)e"" where ""per"" is treated as a single letter. This reduces the problem to arranging the letters ""8, g, y, e, per.""

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the term where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term). Let's simplify the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the powers of \(x\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Now, combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
(-1)^3 = -1
\]

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{8}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8} = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \times -\frac{100}{8} = 10 \times -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to show that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7.

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) becomes:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, calculate the product \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

\[

However, we need to show that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7. Since we have shown that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\), it follows that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is indeed divisible by 7.

\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{对边}}{\text{斜边}} \quad \text{和} \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{邻边}}{\text{斜边}}
\]
给定 $\sin A = 2 \cos A$，我们可以用一个共同的变量来表示 $\sin A$ 和 $\cos A$。设 $\cos A = x$。那么 $\sin A = 2x$。由于 $\sin^2 A + \cos^2 A = 1$，我们将 $\sin A$ 和 $\cos A$ 的表达式代入：

"To determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14}\), we need to analyze the function's asymptotes and intercepts.

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \(x\) approaches infinity. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2, so the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). This means \(c = 0\).

"$99^2 + 99 + 1$’s value can be calculated as follows:

1. Recognize that the expression $99^2 + 99 + 1$ can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to compute. Notice that $99 = 100 - 1$, so we can substitute this into the expression:

This simplifies to:

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

Now, we can combine the fractions:

"Let's denote the volume of the original cylinder as \( V \). The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula \( V = \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Since the volume of the original cylinder is \( 20\pi \) cubic units, we have:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h = 20\pi \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r^2 h = 20 \]

Now, the new cylinder has a volume that is twice the original volume, so the new volume is \( 2 \times 20\pi = 40\pi \) cubic units. Let's denote the new height as \( h' \). The new volume can be expressed as:

\[ \pi r^2 h' = 40\pi \]

This simplifies to:

\[ r^2 h' = 40 \]

Since the radius \( r \) remains the same, we can divide the equation for the new volume by the equation for the original volume:

\[ \frac{r^2 h'}{r^2 h} = \frac{40\pi}{20\pi} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ \frac{h'}{h} = 2 \]

So, the new height \( h' \) is twice the original height \( h \):

\[ h' = 2h \]

The time taken to fill the new cylinder is 4 times the time taken to fill the original cylinder. Since the volume of the new cylinder is twice the volume of the original cylinder, and the time taken is proportional to the volume, the time taken to fill the new cylinder is indeed 4 times the time taken to fill the original cylinder. This confirms that the new height is twice the original height.

Therefore, the new height is twice the original height, and since the original height is \( h \), the new height is \( 2h \).

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is always increasing, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For the function to be always increasing, the derivative of \(f(x)\) in both intervals must be positive, and the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the left must be less than or equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the right.

First, let's find the derivative of \(f(x)\) in both intervals:
1. For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\), so \(f'(x) = 2ax\).
2. For \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\), so \(f'(x) = a\).

For the function to be increasing, \(f'(x) > 0\) in both intervals. This means:
1. For \(x \geq a\), \(2ax > 0\). Since \(x \geq a\), this implies \(a > 0\).
2. For \(x < a\), \(a > 0\).

So, \(a\) must be positive. Now, we need to ensure that the function is continuous and increasing at \(x = a\). This means that the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the left must be less than or equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\) from the right:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) \leq f(a). \]
This translates to:
\[ a(a) + 2a \leq a(a)^2, \]
which simplifies to:
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3. \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
The quadratic \(a^2 - a - 2\) can be factored as:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]
Since \(a > 0\), we only consider the positive roots. The roots of the quadratic are \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we only consider \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the value of \(a\) that satisfies all the conditions is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) in the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \), we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). This process involves completing the square for both the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the given equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms. The expression \( x^2 - 10x \) can be written as:
\[ x^2 - 10x = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms. The expression \( y^2 + 6y \) can be written as:
\[ y^2 + 6y = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]

Combining the constants on the left side, we have:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]

Rearranging the equation to isolate the completed squares, we get:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle, the right side must be a positive number, which means \( 34 - c \) must be positive. However, since we are only asked to find the value of \( c \), we can see that the equation is in the standard form of a circle's equation when the right side is zero. Therefore, we set \( 34 - c = 0 \) to find \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 0 \]
\[ c = 34 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",33,"[33, '33']",False
"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) for some \(x \in [0,1]\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means we need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]

We need this to equal \(x\):

\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]

If \(x = 0\), then the equation is satisfied. If \(x = 1\), then the equation is also satisfied. So, \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\) are always solutions. However, we are interested in the case where \(f(x) \neq x\), so we need to find other solutions.

Let's assume \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq 1\). Then we can divide both sides of the equation by \(x\):

\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]

This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution in \((0,1)\), we can use the fact that \(f(x) = x\) has solutions at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\), and we need to find when \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a solution in \((0,1)\).

The function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) is a parabola that opens downwards with a maximum at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). The value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{\lambda}{4}.\]

For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution in \((0,1)\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\), which is \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\), must be greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\) (since \(f(x)\) must map some value in \((0,1)\) back to \((0,1)\) and the only way this can happen is if the maximum value of \(f(x)\) is greater than \(\frac{1}{2}\)). Therefore, we need:

\[\frac{\lambda}{4} > \frac{1}{2} \implies \lambda > 2.\]

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The given equation is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Notice that \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\) and \(\sin 50^\circ = \cos 40^\circ\). So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ
\]

This can be rearranged as:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ)
\]

Using the angle addition formulas, we get:

\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (40^\circ - 35^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Again, using the angle addition formulas, we get:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Now, we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

We know that \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]

By inspection, we see that if \(\theta = 40^\circ\), then \(\tan 40^\circ = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}\). Therefore, the value of \(\theta\) is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime \(5\), we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (e.g., \(5^3 = 125\)) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Therefore, the total number of trailing zeros is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9
\]
Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum value might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:

\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]

Now, we need to find the maximum value of the function \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points.

The derivative of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[ \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

We now evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):

\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number that satisfies the quadratic equation derived from this relationship. Specifically, if we let \( z = e^{i\theta} \), then \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2\cos\theta \). Therefore, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \]
\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \]

The value \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is the real part of the complex number \( e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Thus, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \]
\[ \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \frac{1}{-1} = -1 \]

First, recall that the centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Also, the angle bisectors of a triangle intersect at the incenter, but here we are given that the angle bisectors intersect \( BC \) at points \( M \) and \( N \), which implies that \( M \) and \( N \) are the points where the angle bisectors of \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \) meet \( BC \). This means \( M \) and \( N \) are the points where the angle bisectors of \( \angle B \) and \( \angle C \) intersect \( BC \), and these points divide \( BC \) in the ratio of the other two sides of the triangle.

The area of triangle \( W G N \) can be found by considering the properties of the centroid and the angle bisectors.

"To determine the sixth term of the sequence, we need to identify the pattern of the sequence. Let's denote the \( n \)-th term of the sequence by \( a_n \).

Given:
- The 5th term \( a_5 = 200 \)
- The 8th term \( a_8 = 500 \)

We assume the sequence is an arithmetic sequence, where each term is obtained by adding a constant difference \( d \) to the previous term. The general form of the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d \]

First, we express the 5th and 8th terms using this formula:

\[ a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500 \]

We now have a system of linear equations:

2. \( a_1 + 7d = 500 \)

To eliminate \( a_1 \), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[ 3d = 300 \]

3. We need to find a number \( x \) such that the sum of its digits is 100 and the product of its digits is 150.

First, let's consider the possible digits that can multiply to 150. The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The digits of \( x \) must be single-digit numbers (0 through 9). Therefore, we need to find a combination of single-digit numbers that multiply to 150. The possible combinations are:

Now, let's check if the sum of these digits is 100:
\[ 2 + 3 + 5 + 5 = 15 \]

Since 15 is not equal to 100, we need to consider other combinations of digits. However, since the product of the digits must be 150 and the sum must be 100, we need to find a way to distribute the digits such that their sum is 100.

Given the constraints, it is not possible to find a single-digit number whose digits sum to 100 and whose product is 150. Therefore, there is no such number \( x \) that satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

Thus, the problem as stated has no solution. The correct interpretation should be that there is no such number \( x \) that meets both conditions.

"1. **Identify the areas of the triangles:**
   - The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
     - The base of this triangle is the horizontal segment from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which has a length of 2 units.
     - The height of this triangle is the vertical segment from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which has a length of 4 units.
     - The area of the first triangle is given by:
       \[
       \text{Area}_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
       \]

   - The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).
     - The base of this triangle is the horizontal segment from \((3, 4)\) to \((3, 0)\), which has a length of 4 units.
     - The height of this triangle is the vertical segment from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\), which has a length of 3 units.
     - The area of the second triangle is given by:
       \[
       \text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6
       \]

2. **Calculate the total area of the two triangles:**
   - The total area of the two triangles is the sum of their individual areas:
     \[
     \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_1 + \text{Area}_2 = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]

3. **Determine the area of the remaining part of the square:**
   - The square has a side length of 4 units, so its total area is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the square} = 4 \times 4 = 16
     \]
   - The area of the remaining part of the square, which is the quadrilateral, is the total area of the square minus the total area of the two triangles:
     \[
     \text{Area of the quadrilateral} = \text{Area of the square} - \text{Total Area} = 16 - 10 = 6
     \]

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on the dice is 7 when the dice are rolled three times, and the sum of the numbers on the dice is 11 when the dice are rolled four times.

First, let's consider the possible outcomes for the sum of the numbers on three dice. The minimum sum is 3 (1+1+1) and the maximum sum is 18 (6+6+6). The possible sums are 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18. We are interested in the sum being 7.

The number of ways to get a sum of 7 with three dice can be calculated by listing all the combinations:
(1, 1, 5), (1, 2, 4), (1, 3, 3), (1, 4, 2), (1, 5, 1), (2, 1, 4), (2, 2, 3), (2, 3, 2), (2, 4, 1), (3, 1, 3), (3, 2, 2), (3, 3, 1), (4, 1, 2), (4, 2, 1), (5, 1, 1).

There are 15 different combinations that sum to 7. Since each die has 6 faces, there are a total of \(6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216\) possible outcomes when rolling three dice. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum of 7 is:
\[
\frac{15}{216} = \frac{5}{72}
\]

Next, let's consider the possible outcomes for the sum of the numbers on four dice. The minimum sum is 4 (1+1+1+1) and the maximum sum is 24 (6+6+6+6). The possible sums are 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24. We are interested in the sum being 11.

The number of ways to get a sum of 11 with four dice can be calculated by listing all the combinations, but it is more practical to use a combinatorial approach or a generating function. The number of ways to get a sum of 11 with four dice is 80. Since each die has 6 faces, there are a total of \(6 \times 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 1296\) possible outcomes when rolling four dice. Therefore, the probability of getting a sum of 11 is:
\[
\frac{80}{1296} = \frac{5}{81}
\]

Since the events of rolling three dice and rolling four dice are independent, the probability that both events occur (i.e., the sum of the numbers on the dice is 7 when rolled three times and the sum of the numbers on the dice is 11 when rolled four times) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[
\frac{5}{72} \times \frac{5}{81} = \frac{25}{5832}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers on the dice is 7 when rolled three times and the sum of the numbers on the dice is 11 when rolled four times is:
\[

"To determine the units digit of the number \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the expression. Notice that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Since \(4321\) is less than \(20000000\), the value of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is a decimal number less than 1. Specifically, it is a very small decimal number that is less than 0.0000001. When expressed as a decimal, it is \(0.00000021605\ldots\).

The units digit of a decimal number is the digit immediately to the left of the decimal point. In this case, the units digit is \(0\).

Thus, the units digit of the number \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",14,"[14, '14']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use some trigonometric identities and properties of the sine function.

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines:
\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]
Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \sin 60^\circ = \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \right) = \frac{3}{16}.
\]
Therefore,
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left( \frac{3}{16} \right)^2 = \frac{9}{256}.

2. **Interpret the equation in cylindrical coordinates**: In cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), the variable \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane. The equation \( z = c \) means that for any point on this surface, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

3. **Visualize the surface**: The equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions.

4. **Identify the geometric shape**: A plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at a constant height \( c \) is known as a ** flat surface** or a ** plane**.

"To find the smallest possible angle between vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the cross product. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, substituting the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product, we get:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying this equation, we find:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = 30^\circ\) or \(\theta = 150^\circ\). Since we are asked to find the smallest possible angle, we choose \(\theta = 30^\circ\).

Thus, the smallest possible angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote these roots by \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Therefore, we have:
\[ f(\alpha) = 0, \quad f(\beta) = 0, \quad f(\gamma) = 0 \]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). This means:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \]

To find the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to solve:
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]

Let \( y = x + 5 \). Then:
\[ f(y) = 0 \]

Since \( y = x + 5 \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[ x = y - 5 \]

Thus, if \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[ \alpha - 5, \beta - 5, \gamma - 5 \]

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) \]

We can simplify this expression:
\[ (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) = \alpha + \beta + \gamma - 15 \]

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots \( \alpha + \beta + \gamma \) is given by:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = -\frac{b}{a} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \). Therefore:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \):
\[ (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine of an angle:
\[
\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1
\]
We will use the identity for the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine of double angles:
\[
\sin^2 2\theta = 4 \sin^2 \theta \cos^2 \theta
\]
and
\[
\cos^2 2\theta = 1 - 2 \sin^2 2\theta
\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the identity involving the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sine and cosine of angles that sum up to 90 degrees. Specifically, we use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (90^\circ - \theta)} = 8
\]
This identity can be derived from the fact that \(\sin (90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\).

Now, let's apply this identity to our problem. We need to find:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}
\]

We can use the identity for the sum of the reciprocals of the squares of the sine and cosine of angles that sum up to 90 degrees. Notice that:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 80^\circ} = 8
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 70^\circ} = 8
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 50^\circ} = 8
\]

However, we need to adjust our approach because we only have three terms. Instead, we can use the fact that:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 8
\]

This is a known result from trigonometric identities and properties. Therefore, the value of the given expression is:

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon whose sum of interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6
\]

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

\[
n = 8

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to simplify the expression inside the sine function. Let's start by understanding the relationship between \(\tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\).

Recall that \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\). Therefore, we can rewrite \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\) as:
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x)
\]

Now, substitute this into the original equation:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \left( \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1} (x) \right) \right)

Simplify the expression inside the sine function:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1} (x) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right)

\[
1 = \frac{1}{3}

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the shortest distance between two skew lines. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{b} \cdot (\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1})|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}
\]

where \(\mathbf{a_1}\) and \(\mathbf{a_2}\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the cross product of the direction vectors of the two lines.

First, identify the points and direction vectors:
\[
\mathbf{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a_2} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, compute the vector \(\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1}\):
\[
\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, find the cross product \(\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2}\):
\[
\mathbf{d_1} \times \mathbf{d_2} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix}

\[
= \mathbf{i} (0) - \mathbf{j} (0) + \mathbf{k} (0)
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the direction vectors are parallel (as \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2\mathbf{d_1}\)), the lines are parallel and do not intersect. Therefore, the shortest distance between them is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line.

We can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line in 3D:
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} \times \mathbf{d_1}\|}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\|}

\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j} (16 - 10) + \mathbf{k} (72 - 14)

\[
= \mathbf{i} (31) - \mathbf{j} (6) + \mathbf{k} (58)
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} \times \mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{4361}

Now, compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d_1}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4}

\[
= \sqrt{89}

Finally, compute the shortest distance:
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a_2} - \mathbf{a_1} \times \mathbf{d_1}\|}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\|}
\]
\[
= \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}}
\]
\[

   The vertices of the quadrilateral are given as:

2. **Determine the type of quadrilateral:**
   By examining the coordinates, we can see that the quadrilateral has opposite sides that are equal and parallel. Additionally, all sides are of equal length, and all angles are right angles. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a square.

3. **Calculate the side length of the square:**
   To find the side length, we can use the distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\):
   \[
   d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}

5. **Determine the number of integer coordinates within the area:**
   The area of the square is 100 square units. Since the vertices of the square are at integer coordinates, the integer coordinates within the area include all integer points \((x, y)\) such that:
   \[
   -5 \leq x \leq 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 \leq y \leq 4

   This forms a grid of points. To find the total number of integer coordinates, we count the number of integer values for \(x\) and \(y\):
   - \(x\) ranges from \(-5\) to \(5\), which includes \(11\) integer values.
   - \(y\) ranges from \(-4\) to \(4\), which includes \(9\) integer values.

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

We are given the following cross products:

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given operation definition for the operation @. The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

We are asked to find the value of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\). According to the definition, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation definition:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now we multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

"1. **Define the problem and the sample space:**
   - We have four distinct points \( A, B, C, D \) on a plane.
   - We need to determine the probability that the line segment \( AB \) and the line segment \( CD \) intersect.

2. **Calculate the total number of ways to choose two pairs of points:**
   - The number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first pair is given by the combination formula \( \binom{4}{2} \).
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = \frac{4!}{2!(4-2)!} = \frac{4 \times 3}{2 \times 1} = 6

   - After choosing the first pair, the remaining two points automatically form the second pair.
   - Therefore, the total number of ways to choose 2 pairs of points is 6.

3. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - For the line segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points is on one side of the line segment formed by the other pair.
   - There are exactly 3 ways to arrange the points such that \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect:
     - \( A, C, B, D \)
     - \( A, D, B, C \)
     - \( C, A, D, B \)
   - These are the only configurations where the line segments intersect.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability \( P \) that the line segments \( AB \) and \( CD \) intersect is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes.

"Given that the circle has a diameter \(D\) and the arcs \(AB\) and \(BC\) measure 1 and 2 respectively, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees.

First, let's determine the measure of the arc \(AC\). Since the circle is divided into arcs \(AB\), \(BC\), and \(CA\), and the total measure of the circle is \(360^\circ\), we have:
\[
\text{arc } AC = 360^\circ - \text{arc } AB - \text{arc } BC = 360^\circ - 1 - 2 = 357^\circ.

Next, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\). Since \(D\) is the center of the circle, \(\angle ADC\) is a central angle that subtends the arc \(AC\). The measure of a central angle is equal to the measure of the arc it subtends. Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:

"Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find the value of \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha
\]

We already know \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the formulas for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Next, we multiply \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}

This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

For ""Perimeter"":
\[ \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5!}{5! \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{336}{6} = 56 \]

Now, we multiply the number of combinations from both words to get the total number of ways to choose 5 letters from ""Perimeter"" and 5 letters from ""Circumference"":

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then \( BC = 2x \).

In \( \triangle ABC \), since \( AB = AC \), \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \), \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BAC = \theta \). We can use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle to find the relationship between the sides.

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{DC}{\sin \angle DBC}

Since \( \angle BCD = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \) and \( \angle DBC = \angle ABC = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \), we have:

Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AM = 11 \), \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = 1 \). Therefore, \( BD = DC = 1 \).

\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(3\theta)

\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the inequality in a more manageable form. Notice that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) can be factored as \(x^2(x^2 + 4)\). This expression is always non-negative because it is a product of \(x^2\) and \(x^2 + 4\), both of which are non-negative for all real \(x\).

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Consider the function \(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\). We need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) < 21\).

To do this, we can solve the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 = 21\). Let \(y = x^2\), then the equation becomes \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). This is a quadratic equation in \(y\), which we can solve using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\).

\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions for \(y\):

\[
y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7
\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution. Therefore, \(x^2 = 3\), which means \(x = \pm \sqrt{3}\).

The function \(f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is less than 21 between the roots \(-\sqrt{3}\) and \(\sqrt{3}\). Therefore, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative, it is always greater than \(-4\). Therefore, the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true for all real \(x\).

### Step 3: Combine the results

The solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. Since the second inequality is always true, the solution is simply the solution to the first inequality:

\[
-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also have the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\), we can express \(x+y\), \(x+z\), and \(y+z\) as \(s-z\), \(s-y\), and \(s-x\) respectively. Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
or:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
so:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}) = s^3 - 72.
\]
So:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
and:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Then:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To determine which year the ratio of male to female pieces of cake was the highest, we need to calculate the ratio for each year and compare them.

The ratio of male to female pieces of cake is given by the formula:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Percentage of male pieces}}{\text{Percentage of female pieces}} \]

Let's calculate the ratio for each year:

1. For the 9th grade:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{41.1\%}{39.4\%} = \frac{41.1}{39.4} \approx 1.0436 \]

2. For the 10th grade:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{34.4\%}{33.1\%} = \frac{34.4}{33.1} \approx 1.0396 \]

3. For the 11th grade:
\[ \text{Ratio} = \frac{20.6\%}{13.8\%} = \frac{20.6}{13.8} \approx 1.5037 \]

4. For the 12th grade:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the shortest distance between the parabola \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) and the line \( y = x \), we need to find the point on the parabola where the tangent line is parallel to the line \( y = x \). The slope of the line \( y = x \) is 1, so we need to find the point on the parabola where the derivative is also 1.

First, we find the derivative of the parabola:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \]
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot 2x = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}x \]

We set the derivative equal to 1 to find the x-coordinate of the point where the tangent line is parallel to the line \( y = x \):
\[ \sqrt{2}x = 1 \]
\[ x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Next, we substitute \( x = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) back into the equation of the parabola to find the y-coordinate:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 - 3 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{2}{4} - 3 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1}{2} - 3 \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{6}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( -\frac{5}{2} \right) = -\frac{5}{2\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} \]

So, the point on the parabola is \( \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} \right) \).

Now, we find the distance between this point and the line \( y = x \). The formula for the distance from a point \( (x_1, y_1) \) to a line \( ax + by + c = 0 \) is:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{|ax_1 + by_1 + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} \]

For the line \( y = x \), we can rewrite it as \( x - y = 0 \), so \( a = 1 \), \( b = -1 \), and \( c = 0 \). Substituting the point \( \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} \right) \) into the formula, we get:
\[ \text{Distance} = \frac{\left| 1 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + (-1) \cdot \left( -\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} \right) + 0 \right|}{\sqrt{1^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{\left| \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} \right|}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\left| \frac{2\sqrt{2}}{4} + \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{4} \right|}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\left| \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4} \right|}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7\sqrt{2}}{4\sqrt{2}} = \frac{7}{4} \]

Therefore, the shortest distance is \( \frac{7}{4} \), and we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = 4 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:
\[ a + b = 7 + 4 = 11 \]

"为了找到 \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \)，我们需要确定 \( f(x) = 0 \) 和 \( f(x) = 6 \) 的 \( x \) 值，然后将这些值相加。

首先，我们找到 \( f^{-1}(0) \)。这意味着我们需要解 \( f(x) = 0 \)。

1. 对于 \( x \leq 3 \)，我们有 \( f(x) = 3 - x \)。设 \( 3 - x = 0 \)：
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.

   由于 \( x = 3 \) 满足条件 \( x \leq 3 \)，\( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \)。

2. 对于 \( x > 3 \)，我们有 \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \)。设 \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \)：
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
   \]
   这给我们 \( x = 0 \) 或 \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \)。由于 \( x > 3 \)，\( x = 0 \) 不是解。解二次方程 \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \)：
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0.
   \]
   这给我们 \( x = 3 \) 或 \( x = -1 \)。由于 \( x > 3 \)，这个方程没有解。因此，对于 \( x > 3 \) 没有解。

因此，\( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \)。

接下来，我们找到 \( f^{-1}(6) \)。这意味着我们需要解 \( f(x) = 6 \)。

1. 对于 \( x \leq 3 \)，我们有 \( f(x) = 3 - x \)。设 \( 3 - x = 6 \)：
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.

   由于 \( x = -3 \) 满足条件 \( x \leq 3 \)，\( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \)。

2. 对于 \( x > 3 \)，我们有 \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \)。设 \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \)：
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0.

   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of point \( P \) in the given 3D coordinate system. The coordinates of the vertices of the regular hexagon are given as follows:

- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

Point \( P \) is equidistant from all these vertices, and the distances from \( P \) to each vertex are the same. Let's denote the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( B \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}

The distance from \( P \) to \( C \) is:

\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2}
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2}
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( F \) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

Since \( P \) is equidistant from all these points, we can set any two of these distances equal to each other. Let's set the distance from \( P \) to \( A \) equal to the distance from \( P \) to \( B \):
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2
\]

Subtracting \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 1 \) from both sides, we get:
\[
-2x = 2x
\]

This implies:
\[
x = 0
\]

Now, let's set the distance from \( P \) to \( A \) equal to the distance from \( P \) to \( C \):
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}
\]

Substituting \( x = 0 \), we get:
\[
\sqrt{(0-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
1 + y^2 + z^2 = y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2
\]

Subtracting \( y^2 + z^2 + 1 \) from both sides, we get:
\[
0 = -2y

This implies:
\[
y = 0
\]

Now, let's set the distance from \( P \) to \( A \) equal to the distance from \( P \) to \( D \):
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2}
\]

Substituting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), we get:
\[
\sqrt{(0-1)^2 + 0^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + (0+1)^2 + z^2}
\]

Simplifying, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 + z^2} = \sqrt{1 + z^2}
\]

This is always true, so it does not provide new information. However, we can use the fact that \( P \) is equidistant from all vertices to find \( z \). The distance from \( P \) to \( A \) is:
\[
\sqrt{(0-1)^2 + 0^2 + z^2} = \sqrt{1 + z^2}
\]

The distance from \( P \) to \( E \) is:
\[
\sqrt{0^2 + 0^2 + (z-1)^2} = \sqrt{z^2 - 2z + 1}
\]

Setting these equal, we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 + z^2} = \sqrt{z^2 - 2z + 1}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
1 + z^2 = z^2 - 2z + 1
\]

Subtracting \( z^2 + 1 \) from both sides, we get:
\[
0 = -2z
\]

This implies:
\[
z = 0
\]

"为了找到点 \((6, 0)\) From 直线 \(y = 2x - 2\) 上的最短距离，我们可以使用点到直线的距离公式。点 \((x_1, y_1)\) 到直线 \(Ax + By + C = 0\) 的距离 \(d\) 由以下公式给出：

\[ d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} \]

首先，我们需要将直线的方程 \(y = 2x - 2\) 重写为标准形式 \(Ax + By + C = 0\)。重写后，我们得到：

这里，\(A = 2\)，\(B = -1\)，且 \(C = -2\)。点 \((x_1, y_1)\) 是 \((6, 0)\)。将这些值代入距离公式，我们得到：

\[ d = \frac{|12 - 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} \]
\[ d = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} \]
\[ d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \]
\[ d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} \]

"Given the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
From Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
so if we let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\), then \(a + b = -2\). Therefore,
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab.
\]
We also know from Vieta's formulas that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
which can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0,
\]
or
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 b + \alpha_3\alpha_4 a = 0.
\]
This implies:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 b = -\alpha_3\alpha_4 a.
\]
We also know that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2,
\]
so:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4}.
\]
Substituting \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4}\) into \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 b = -\alpha_3\alpha_4 a\), we get:
\[
\frac{2b}{\alpha_3\alpha_4} = -\alpha_3\alpha_4 a,
\]
or
\[
2b = -(\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 a.
\]
Since \(a + b = -2\), we can express \(b\) as \(b = -2 - a\). Substituting \(b = -2 - a\) into the equation \(2b = -(\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 a\), we get:
\[
2(-2 - a) = -(\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 a,
\]
or
\[
-4 - 2a = -(\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 a,
\]
or
\[
4 + 2a = (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 a.
\]
Since \((\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = \frac{4}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\), we have:
\[
4 + 2a = \frac{4a}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\), we get:
\[
4\alpha_1\alpha_2 + 2a\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 4a,
\]
or
\[
4\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 4a - 2a\alpha_1\alpha_2,
\]
or
\[
4\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 2a(2 - \alpha_1\alpha_2).
\]
Let \(x = \alpha_1\alpha_2\), then:
\[
4x = 2a(2 - x),
\]
or
\[
2x = a(2 - x).
\]
Since \(a + b = -2\), we have \(a = -2 - b\). Substituting \(a = -2 - b\) into the equation \(2x = a(2 - x)\), we get:
\[
2x = (-2 - b)(2 - x),
\]
or
\[
2x = -4 + 2x - 2b + bx,
\]
or
\[
0 = -4 - 2b + bx,
\]
or
\[
2b = bx - 4,
\]
or
\[
b = \frac{bx - 4}{x}.
\]
Since \(b = -2 - a\), we have:
\[
-2 - a = \frac{bx - 4}{x},
\]
or
\[
-2x - ax = bx - 4,
\]
or
\[
-2x - ax = bx - 4,

\[
-2x - ax = bx - 4,

\[

"Let's denote the cost of the first shirt as \( x \) and the cost of the second shirt as \( y \). According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( x + y = 1.24 \)
2. \( x + 0.06 + y = 1.82 \)

From the second equation, we can simplify it to:

\[ x + y + 0.06 = 1.82 \]

Since we know from the first equation that \( x + y = 1.24 \), we can substitute \( 1.24 \) for \( x + y \) in the second equation:

   - We have a parallelogram \(ABCD\) with center \(O\).
   - The ratio \(AB/AD = k\).
   - We need to find the probability that a randomly chosen side from the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex.

2. **Analyze the diagonals of the parallelogram:**
   - The diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other at the center \(O\).
   - Therefore, \(O\) is the midpoint of both \(AC\) and \(BD\).

3. **Determine the distances from \(O\) to the vertices:**
   - Since \(O\) is the midpoint of \(AC\) and \(BD\), the distance from \(O\) to any vertex is half the length of the diagonal.
   - Let \(AC = d_1\) and \(BD = d_2\). Then, the distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(d_1/2\) or \(d_2/2\).

4. **Consider the sides of the parallelogram:**
   - The sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) are given with the ratio \(AB/AD = k\).
   - Let \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Then, \(a = kb\).

5. **Determine the distances from \(O\) to the sides:**
   - The distance from \(O\) to a side of the parallelogram is half the height of the parallelogram.
   - Let the height from \(A\) to \(BC\) be \(h\). Then, the height from \(O\) to \(BC\) is \(h/2\).

6. **Compare the distances:**
   - The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(d_1/2\) or \(d_2/2\).
   - The distance from \(O\) to any side is \(h/2\).

7. **Determine the condition for a side to be closer to \(O\) than to any vertex:**
   - For a side to be closer to \(O\) than to any vertex, the distance from \(O\) to the side must be less than the distance from \(O\) to the vertex.
   - This implies \(h/2 < d_1/2\) and \(h/2 < d_2/2\).

8. **Calculate the probability:**
   - Since \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals, the probability that a randomly chosen side from the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), which is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \), which is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money the family had after the changes in their scores, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money the family had before any changes.
2. Determine the total change in scores and how it affects the total amount of money.
3. Calculate the final total amount of money after the changes.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money the family had before any changes:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52

Adding these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

\[

So, the total amount of money before any changes is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine the total change in scores. The problem states that the family's scores changed in such a way that the total amount of money they had was adjusted. However, the problem does not specify the exact nature of the changes (e.g., how much each person's score changed and how that affects the total amount of money). Since the problem does not provide specific details about the changes in scores, we can assume that the total amount of money remains the same after the changes (as the problem states "" summary scores are adjusted to reflect the new total amount of money"").

Therefore, the total amount of money after the changes is still \$126.59.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{126.59}

"To find the average score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students.
2. Calculate the total number of points scored by all students.
3. Divide the total number of points by the total number of students to get the average score.

Let's start with the first step:

The total number of students is the sum of the students in each group:
\[ 20 + 8 + 2 = 30 \]

Next, we calculate the total number of points scored by all students. We do this by multiplying the number of students in each group by their respective scores and then summing these products:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Now, let's perform the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Adding these products together gives us the total number of points:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Finally, we find the average score by dividing the total number of points by the total number of students:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve for \( n \) in the given problem, we need to use the information that the sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. The angles in the triangle are given as \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 180
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[
n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 180
\]

\[
2n + 1 = 180
\]

Next, we isolate \( n \) by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2n = 179
\]

Then, we divide both sides by 2:

\[
n = \frac{179}{2} = 89.5
\]

Thus, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{89.5}

"To determine how many more feet of wood the first piece of wood is compared to the second piece of wood, we need to subtract the length of the second piece of wood from the length of the first piece of wood.

The first piece of wood is 300 feet long.
The second piece of wood is 400 feet long.

We perform the subtraction as follows:
\[ 400 - 300 = 100 \]

Therefore, the second piece of wood is 100 feet longer than the first piece of wood. The first piece of wood is 100 feet shorter than the second piece of wood.

The answer is \(\boxed{100}\).","[100, '100']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"首先，我们知道 \(\omega\) 是一个三次单位根，满足 \(\omega^3 = 1\)。因此，\(\omega\) 和 \(\omega^2\) 是方程 \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) 的两个根，且 \(\omega \neq 1\)。此外，我们知道 \(\omega\) 和 \(\omega^2\) 满足以下性质：
\[
\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0.
\]

我们需要计算表达式 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\)。首先，我们找到一个共同的分母：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

我们知道 \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\)，所以 \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\)。代入上式，我们得到：
\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

接下来，我们计算分母 \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\)：
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

因此，我们得到：
\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

所以，表达式 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) 的值是 \(\boxed{1}\)。","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance from point \(A\) to the line segment \(BC\), we need to find the perpendicular distance from point \(A\) to the line passing through points \(B\) and \(C\).

First, let's find the equation of the line \(BC\). The coordinates of points \(B\) and \(C\) are \(B(3, 0)\) and \(C(0, -4)\).

The slope \(m\) of line \(BC\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-4 - 0}{0 - 3} = \frac{-4}{-3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\) with point \(B(3, 0)\):
\[
y - 0 = \frac{4}{3}(x - 3)
\]
\[
y = \frac{4}{3}x - 4
\]

Next, we need the perpendicular distance from point \(A(-3, 3)\) to this line. The formula for the perpendicular distance from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we rewrite the line equation \(y = \frac{4}{3}x - 4\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):
\[
\frac{4}{3}x - y - 4 = 0
\]
Multiplying through by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
4x - 3y - 12 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 4\), \(B = -3\), and \(C = -12\). Substituting the coordinates of point \(A(-3, 3)\) into the distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|4(-3) + (-3)(3) - 12|}{\sqrt{4^2 + (-3)^2}}
\]
\[
= \frac{|-12 - 9 - 12|}{\sqrt{16 + 9}}
\]
\[
= \frac{|-33|}{\sqrt{25}}
\]
\[
= \frac{33}{5}
\]

Thus, the shortest distance from point \(A\) to the line segment \(BC\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{33}{5}}
