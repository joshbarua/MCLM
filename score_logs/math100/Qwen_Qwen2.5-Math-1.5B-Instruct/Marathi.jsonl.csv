"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \). We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In this triangle, \( \angle D \) is opposite to side \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DE \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
We are given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \( DE \), we solve for \( DE \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DE \) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \( DE \) is:
\[
\boxed{10}

"1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in polar form:**

   Given:
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

   First, find the magnitude \( |z| \):
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}))^2}
   \]
   Simplify the expression inside the square root:
   \[
   (2 + \sqrt{2})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2 = 6 + 4\sqrt{2}
   \]
   \[
   (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}))^2 = (3 + 3\sqrt{2})^2 = 9 + 18\sqrt{2} + 18 = 27 + 18\sqrt{2}
   \]
   Add these results:
   \[
   |z| = \sqrt{(6 + 4\sqrt{2}) + (27 + 18\sqrt{2})} = \sqrt{33 + 22\sqrt{2}}
   \]

   Next, find the argument \( \arg(z) \):
   \[
   \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right)
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}} = \frac{-3(1 + \sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}} = -3
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   \arg(z) = \tan^{-1}(-3)
   \]

   Now, find the magnitude \( |c| \):
   \[
   |c| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13}
   \]

   Next, find the argument \( \arg(c) \):
   \[
   \arg(c) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)
   \]

2. **Calculate \( w \) using the given conditions:**

   Given that \( w \) is such that \( |w - c| = |w| \) and \( \arg(w) = \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4} \), we can write:
   \[
   w = |w| \left( \cos\left(\arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]

   Since \( |w - c| = |w| \), we have:
   \[
   |w - c| = |w|
   \]
   This implies that \( w \) lies on the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \( c \) and the origin. Therefore, \( w \) is equidistant from \( c \) and the origin.

   The distance from \( c \) to the origin is \( |c| = \sqrt{13} \). Therefore, \( w \) is at a distance \( \sqrt{13} \) from the origin.

   The argument of \( w \) is:
   \[
   \arg(w) = \arg(c) + \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

   Since \( \arg(c) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) \), we have:
   \[
   \arg(w) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}
   \]

   Therefore, the coordinates of \( w \) are:
   \[
   w = \sqrt{13} \left( \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) \right)
   \]

   Using the angle addition formulas:
   \[
   \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) - \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)\right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]
   \[
   \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)\right) \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)\right) \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)
   \]

   Since \( \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}} \) and \( \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{13}} \), we get:
   \[
   \cos\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{-3}{\sqrt{13}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{2 + 3}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{26}}
   \]
   \[
   \sin\left(\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) + \frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{-3}{\sqrt{13}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{13}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{-3 + 2}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{-1}{\sqrt{26}}
   \]

   Therefore:
   \[
   w = \sqrt{13} \left( \frac{5}{\sqrt{26}} + i \frac{-1}{\sqrt{26}} \right) = \sqrt{13} \cdot \frac{5 - i}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{5\sqrt{13} - i\sqrt{13}}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{5\sqrt{13}}{\sqrt{26}} - i \frac{\sqrt{13}}{\sqrt{26}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{2}} - i \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

   Therefore, the coordinates of \( w \) are:
   \[
   w = \frac{5\sqrt{2}}{2} - i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]

"1. 从数字242开始，我们需要将其分解为其质因数。
2. 从最小的质数开始检查可除性。242是偶数，所以它可被2整除：
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   因此，我们有：
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]
3. 接下来，我们需要分解121。检查是否可以被下一个最小的质数，即3整除。121的数字之和为\(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\)，这不能被3整除，所以121不能被3整除。
4. 检查是否可以被5整除。数字121的最后一位不是0或5，所以它不能被5整除。
5. 检查是否可以被7整除。将121除以7：
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad (\text{不是整数})
   \]
   所以，121不能被7整除。
6. 检查是否可以被11整除。数字121可以被11整除：
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11

   因此，我们有：
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11

7. 将所有因数组合起来，我们得到：
   \[

" polar coordinates are a two-dimensional coordinate system in which each point on a plane is determined by a distance from a fixed point (the pole) and an angle from a fixed direction (the polar axis). The distance from the pole is called the radial coordinate or radius, and the angle is called the angular coordinate or angle. Polar coordinates are often used in mathematics, physics, and engineering to describe the position of points in a plane or in space. They are particularly useful when dealing with problems that have circular symmetry or when the position of a point is better described in terms of its distance and direction from a fixed point.",[],720,"[720, '720']",False
"1. **Identify the general term in the expansion:**
   The general term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is given by the binomial theorem:

3. **Determine the condition for the term to be independent of \(x\):**
   For the term to be independent of \(x\), the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to show that \( (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) \) is divisible by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression \( (n+2)(n+4)(n+6) \):

\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(n+2)(n+4)(n+6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since each term in the product is of the form \( 7k + \text{constant} \), each term is congruent to the constant modulo 7. Therefore, we can simplify the product modulo 7:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we simplify the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \) modulo 7:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}
\]
\[
3 \cdot 8 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

Thus, we have:

\]
\[
9 \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 9 = 1 \cdot 7 + 2\text{)}

"Given the points \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find a point \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\) and then determine the minimum value of \(x + y\).

First, let's consider the line segments connecting these points. The line segment connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((6, 8)\) has a slope of:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{8 - 3}{6 - 5} = 5
\]
The equation of the line passing through \((5, 3)\) with slope 5 is:

The line segment connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) has a slope of:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{4 - 8}{7 - 6} = -4
\]
The equation of the line passing through \((6, 8)\) with slope -4 is:
\[
y - 8 = -4(x - 6) \implies y = -4x + 32
\]
The line segment connecting \((7, 4)\) and \((5, 3)\) has a slope of:
\[
\text{slope} = \frac{3 - 4}{5 - 7} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The equation of the line passing through \((7, 4)\) with slope \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:
\[
y - 4 = \frac{1}{2}(x - 7) \implies y = \frac{1}{2}x + \frac{1}{2}
\]

We need to find the minimum value of \(x + y\) for points \((x, y)\) on these line segments where \(x > 7\). Let's evaluate \(x + y\) at the endpoints of the line segments for \(x > 7\).

For the line segment from \((6, 8)\) to \((7, 4)\), as \(x\) increases, \(y\) decreases. The point \((7, 4)\) is on this line segment, and \(x + y = 7 + 4 = 11\).

For the line segment from \((5, 3)\) to \((6, 8)\), as \(x\) increases, \(y\) increases. The point \((7, 4)\) is not on this line segment, but we can check the value of \(x + y\) at \(x = 7\):
\[
y = 5(7) - 22 = 35 - 22 = 13 \implies x + y = 7 + 13 = 20

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   - To find the horizontal asymptote, consider the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \to \infty \) or \( x \to -\infty \). The degree of the numerator and the denominator are both 1 and 2, respectively.
   - Divide the leading coefficient of the numerator by the leading coefficient of the denominator:

2. **Apply the difference of cubes formula:**
   The difference of cubes formula states:

   We need to find a constant \(C\) such that:

   u^2 - 17u + 16 \geq 0

   u = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}

   \[
   u = 16 \quad \text{or} \quad u = 1

   So, \(C^2 \geq 16\) or \(C^2 \leq 1\).

"Given that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z^5 = 1 \). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to find the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will follow these steps:

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the given expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the first term as:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we need a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x

So, the final answer is:
\[

   - A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as \( n^2 \) for some integer \( n \).
   - A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as \( m^3 \) for some integer \( m \).
   - If a number is both a perfect square and a perfect cube, it must be a perfect sixth power. This is because the least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6. Therefore, a number that is both a perfect square and a perfect cube can be written as \( k^6 \) for some integer \( k \).

"Given the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\), we need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that their product equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). We will then find the sum \(a + b\).

First, let's expand the product of the two polynomials:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, let's compute each term:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Next, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t\) term equation:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the \(t^2\) term equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is true, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) are equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a(a^2) = a^3.
\]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1.
\]

However, we need to check if these values satisfy the condition that \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\). Since \(a\) is a parameter that defines the function, we need to ensure that the function is well-defined and continuous at \(x = a\). The value \(a = 0\) would make the function \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), which is trivial and not typically the case for such piecewise functions. The values \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\) are more likely to be the correct solutions.

To confirm, we can check the continuity at \(x = 2\) and \(x = -1\):
- For \(a = 2\), the left-hand limit is \(2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 = 4 + 4 = 8\) and the right-hand limit is \(2^3 = 8\), so the function is continuous.
- For \(a = -1\), the left-hand limit is \((-1)^2 + 2(-1) = 1 - 2 = -1\) and the right-hand limit is \((-1)^3 = -1\), so the function is continuous.

Therefore, the value of \(a\) that ensures the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\) is:

"Given the equation \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\), we need to determine the value of \(c\) such that the equation represents a circle with a radius of 1.

First, we complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

For the \(x\) terms:
\[x^2 - 10x\]
We complete the square by adding and subtracting \((\frac{10}{2})^2 = 25\):
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25\]

For the \(y\) terms:
\[y^2 + 6y\]
We complete the square by adding and subtracting \((\frac{6}{2})^2 = 9\):
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9\]

Substituting these completed squares back into the original equation, we get:
\[(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\]
Rearranging gives:
\[(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\]

\[1^2 = 34 - c\]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) has no fixed points in the interval \([0,1]\) but every point in \([0,1]\) is a periodic point of period 2. This means that for every \(x \in [0,1]\), \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

First, let's find the condition for \(f(x) = x\):
\[f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.\]
So, the solutions are:
\[x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.\]
For \(f(x)\) to have no fixed points in \([0,1]\), the solution \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must not lie in the interval \([0,1]\). This means:
\[0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.\]
Solving the inequalities, we get:
\[0 \leq \lambda - 1 \implies \lambda \geq 1,\]
and
\[\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0,\]
which is always true. Therefore, the condition for no fixed points is:
\[1 \leq \lambda < 2.\]

Next, we need to check that for every \(x \in [0,1]\), \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]
For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.\]
Expanding the left side, we get:
\[\lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1,\]
\[\lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.\]
For this to hold for all \(x \in [0,1]\), the coefficients of \(x\), \(x^2\), and \(x^3\) must be such that the equation is satisfied. By inspection, we find that \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution. Let's verify:
\[f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2,\]
\[f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2 - 4x^2 + 4x^3 + 4x^2 - 4x^3) = 2(2x - 2x^2) = 4x - 4x^2 = x.\]
So, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(\lambda = 2\), and \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2 \neq x\) for \(x \in (0,1)\).

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

The given expression is:

\]

First, let's simplify the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine:
\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B) \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B = \cos (A - B).
\]
Applying these, we get:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]
So the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine:
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B) \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B).
\]
Applying these, we get:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]
So the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

We can use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to rewrite \(\cos 25^\circ\) and \(\sin 5^\circ\) in terms of sine and cosine of complementary angles:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.

So the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again, we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

"To find the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to determine how many times 10 is a factor in \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime number 5, we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (e.g., \(5^3 = 125\)) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Therefore, the total number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) and the terms \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are defined only when \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

To find the maximum value, we can consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). Let's evaluate \( f(x, y) \) at some specific points:

1. When \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \):
   \[
   f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.

   \[
   f(1, -1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.

3. When \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 1 \):
   \[
   f(-1, 1) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.

   \[
   f(-1, -1) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.

5. When \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
   \[
   f(0, 0) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 1 = 0.
   \]

6. When \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 1 \):
   \[
   f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1.

   - This means you took 8 coins and have 16 coins left (24 - 8 = 16).

3. **Second Condition:**
   - If you take 6 coins, you have 10 coins left.
   - This means you took 6 coins and have 18 coins left (24 - 6 = 18).

4. **Third Condition:**
   - If you take 10 coins, you have 8 coins left.
   - This means you took 10 coins and have 14 coins left (24 - 10 = 14).

5. **Fourth Condition:**
   - If you take 6 coins, you have 10 coins left.
   - This means you took 6 coins and have 18 coins left (24 - 6 = 18).

First, substitute the given values into the volume formula:

\[ 30 = \frac{1}{3}B \cdot 6.5 \]

To isolate \( B \), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ 30 \cdot 3 = B \cdot 6.5 \]

\[ 90 = B \cdot 6.5 \]

Next, solve for \( B \) by dividing both sides by 6.5:

\[ B = \frac{90}{6.5} \]

To simplify the division, convert 6.5 to a fraction:

\[ 6.5 = \frac{13}{2} \]

So the equation becomes:

\[ B = \frac{90}{\frac{13}{2}} = 90 \cdot \frac{2}{13} = \frac{180}{13} \]

Now, perform the division to get the numerical value:

\[3(4) + 2b = 12\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we have:

\[12 + 2b = 12\]

Next, we isolate \(2b\) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[2b = 12 - 12\]
\[2b = 0\]

Now, we solve for \(b\) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[b = \frac{0}{2}\]
\[b = 0\]

Therefore, the value of \(b\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in the given diagram. The diagram consists of a large rectangle divided into smaller regions, and we need to find the area of the shaded triangles.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the large rectangle. The large rectangle has a height of 4 units and a width of 3 units. Therefore, the area of the large rectangle is:
\[
4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, we observe that the large rectangle is divided into two smaller triangles and a smaller rectangle. The two smaller triangles are congruent right triangles, and the smaller rectangle is the remaining part of the large rectangle.

The base of each smaller triangle is 2 units (since the width of the large rectangle is 3 units and the base of each triangle is half of the width), and the height of each triangle is 4 units (the height of the large rectangle). The area of one of the smaller triangles is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]
Since there are two such triangles, the total area of the two triangles is:
\[
2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ square units}
\]

The area of the smaller rectangle is the area of the large rectangle minus the area of the two triangles:
\[
12 - 8 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

The shaded region consists of the two smaller triangles, so the area of the shaded region is:
\[
8 \text{ square units}
\]

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\boxed{8}

   - We need to find the value of the expression \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} \times \cdots \times \frac{1}{n} \) for \( n = 5 \).
   - The problem states that for \( n = 4 \), the value is \( \frac{1}{24} \).

2. **Generalizing the Pattern:**
   - For \( n = 4 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{24}

   - Start with the value for \( n = 4 \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{24}
     \]
   - Multiply by \( \frac{1}{5} \):
     \[
     \frac{1}{24} \times \frac{1}{5} = \frac{1}{120}

2. **Rewrite the numerator \(4321\) in terms of its prime factors:**
   \[
   4321 = 59 \times 73
   \]
   Therefore, the fraction becomes:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{59 \times 73}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}
   \]

3. **Separate the fraction into parts that are easier to handle:**
   \[
   \frac{59 \times 73}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{59}{5^7} \times \frac{73}{2^8}

4. **Simplify each part separately:**
   - For \(\frac{59}{5^7}\):
     \[
     \frac{59}{5^7} = \frac{59}{78125}
     \]
     Since 59 is a prime number and does not divide \(5^7\), this fraction is already in its simplest form.

   - For \(\frac{73}{2^8}\):
     \[
     \frac{73}{2^8} = \frac{73}{256}
     \]
     Since 73 is a prime number and does not divide \(2^8\), this fraction is already in its simplest form.

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify the expression. This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to express \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). However, we can use another approach by considering the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of sines of angles in the form \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). This gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Since \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

Thus, the value is:

"Given the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) with magnitudes \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\) and \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and their cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), we need to find the angle \(\theta\) between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]
So, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = 30^\circ\) or \(\theta = 150^\circ\). Since the problem does not specify the direction of the cross product, both angles are valid. However, the problem asks for the angle between the vectors, which is the acute angle between them. Therefore, the angle is:
\[
\theta = 30^\circ

Thus, the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30^\circ}\).","[30, '30^\\circ']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine of an angle:
\[
\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1
\]
We can use this identity to express the given expression in a more manageable form. However, we need to use another identity that relates the squares of the sine and cosine of different angles. Specifically, we use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x
\]
and
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x
\]
But these identities alone are not sufficient to directly simplify the given expression. Instead, we use a known result from trigonometry that states:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (2x)} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 (4x)} = 16
\]
for \(x = 10^\circ\). This result is a specific trigonometric identity that can be derived using more advanced techniques such as the sum of squares of sines and cosines in a specific pattern.

Therefore, substituting \(x = 10^\circ\) into the identity, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 16

"1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - We need to find the measure of an angle that is supplementary to an angle of \(1070^\circ\).
   - Supplementary angles add up to \(180^\circ\).

2. **Calculate the supplementary angle:**
   \[
   180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Since \(180^\circ\) is less than \(1070^\circ\), the result will be negative. This indicates that the angle is measured in the clockwise direction from the reference point.

3. **Simplify the calculation:**
   \[
   180^\circ - 1070^\circ = -890^\circ
   \]

4. **Convert the negative angle to a positive angle:**
   - To convert a negative angle to a positive angle, we add \(360^\circ\) (a full rotation) until the result is positive.
   \[
   -890^\circ + 360^\circ = -530^\circ
   \]
   \[
   -530^\circ + 360^\circ = -170^\circ

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( t \) such that \( t + 2 \equiv 23 \pmod{23} \).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Understand the congruence relation:**
   \[
   t + 2 \equiv 23 \pmod{23}
   \]
   This means that \( t + 2 \) leaves a remainder of 23 when divided by 23.

2. **Simplify the congruence:**
   Since \( 23 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), we can rewrite the congruence as:
   \[
   t + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **Isolate \( t \):**
   To find \( t \), we need to isolate it on one side of the congruence. Subtract 2 from both sides:
   \[
   t + 2 - 2 \equiv 0 - 2 \pmod{23}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   t \equiv -2 \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **Convert the negative remainder to a positive remainder:**
   Since \(-2\) is a negative number, we need to convert it to a positive remainder within the range of 0 to 22. We do this by adding 23 to \(-2\):
   \[
   t \equiv -2 + 23 \pmod{23}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   t \equiv 21 \pmod{23}

   We need to check if \( t = 21 \) satisfies the original condition \( t + 2 \equiv 23 \pmod{23} \):
   \[
   21 + 2 = 23

"Given the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to find the value of \(x\).

First, let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\). The angle \(\theta\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Next, we know that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Let \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Then \(\tan(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\phi\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \phi < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Now, we need to find \(\theta + \phi\). Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), we have:
\[
\tan(\theta + \phi) = \frac{\tan(\theta) + \tan(\phi)}{1 - \tan(\theta)\tan(\phi)} = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{1 - x \cdot \frac{1}{x}} = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{1 - 1} = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{0}
\]
This expression is undefined, which means \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\) (since the tangent of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) is undefined).

Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1
\]
However, the given equation is \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), which implies that there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to re-evaluate the context. But based on the standard trigonometric identity, the only way the equation holds is if there is an error in the problem setup or an additional context not provided.

Given the standard trigonometric identity, the value of \(x\) that satisfies the identity \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = 1\) is not possible under the given problem constraints. Therefore, the problem as stated might need re-evaluation.

The correct interpretation under standard trigonometric identities is that the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = 1\) is not possible for any real \(x\). However, if we consider the problem as it is given, the value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is not possible under the standard trigonometric identity.

Thus, the problem as stated might need re-evaluation, but under the standard trigonometric identity, the value of \(x\) is not possible. The correct answer under the standard trigonometric identity is:

     \]
     with direction vector \(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

2. **Check if the lines are parallel:**
   - Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other.
   - We observe that:
     \[
     \mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1}
     \]

     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
     \]
   - Therefore, the lines are parallel.

3. **Check if the lines are coincident:**
   - Two lines are coincident if they have the same point of intersection.
   - To check for intersection, we set the parametric equations equal to each other:
     \[
     \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}

4. **Solve the system of equations:**
   - From the first equation:
     \[
     3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
     \]
   - From the second equation:
     \[
     -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \implies -9t + 18u = 7 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9} \quad \text{(Equation 2)}

   - From the third equation:
     \[
     1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \implies -2t + 4u = 5 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{5}{2} \quad \text{(Equation 3)}

5. **Check for consistency:**
   - Equations 2 and 3 are inconsistent because:
     \[
     \frac{7}{9} \neq \frac{5}{2}

   - Therefore, there is no solution to the system of equations, meaning the lines do not intersect.

- The point \((5,4)\) is 5 units to the right and 4 units up from the origin.
- The point \((-5,4)\) is 5 units to the left and 4 units up from the origin.
- The point \((-5,-4)\) is 5 units to the left and 4 units down from the origin.

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:
\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

\]
Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:
\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the altitude of \(\triangle ACD\). We are also given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, and we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AB = a\) and \(CD = b\), and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(\overline{AC}\)) as \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as the height and \(\overline{CD}\) as the base. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

From the equation \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can express \(h\) as:
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting this expression for \(h\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42b}{a + b}
\]

Since \(a\) and \(b\) are the lengths of the parallel sides of the trapezoid, and the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), and \(\triangle ABC\) is also a right triangle with the same height \(h\), the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

The total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \text{Area of } \triangle ACD + \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{42b}{a + b} + \frac{42a}{a + b} = 42
\]

First, identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\):
- \(m = 7\)
- \(n = 30\)
- \(p = 10\)
- \(q = 21\)

Substitute these values into the operation formula:

2. **Identifying the Relationship**: When two lines are perpendicular, they intersect at a right angle. This relationship is often denoted by the symbol \(\perp\). So, if \(AB\) and \(CD\) are perpendicular, we can write \(AB \perp CD\).

3. **Conclusion**: Since the problem states that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are perpendicular, the relationship between the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) is that they are perpendicular to each other.

"Given the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\). Let's analyze the given information and the diagram step by step.

1. **Understanding the Geometry:**
   - We have a circle with center \(D\).
   - Points \(A\) and \(C\) are on the circumference of the circle.
   - \(A\) and \(C\) are connected to \(D\) by radii \(DA\) and \(DC\).
   - The problem states that the angles subtended by the arc \(AC\) at the circumference are either \(1\) or \(2\) units of some angle measure.

2. **Identifying the Angles:**
   - Let's denote the angle subtended by the arc \(AC\) at the circumference as \(\theta\).
   - According to the problem, \(\theta\) can be either \(1\) or \(2\) units of some angle measure. However, since the problem does not specify the exact angle measure, we will assume that the angle measure is consistent throughout the problem.

3. **Using the Inscribed Angle Theorem:**
   - The inscribed angle theorem states that the measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.
   - Therefore, if the angle subtended by the arc \(AC\) at the circumference is \(\theta\), then the central angle subtended by the same arc is \(2\theta\).

4. **Given Angles:**
   - The problem states that the angles subtended by the arc \(AC\) at the circumference are either \(1\) or \(2\) units of some angle measure.
   - Let's assume the angle measure is \(x\) units. Then the central angle is \(2x\) units.

5. **Finding the Central Angle:**
   - Since the problem does not specify the exact angle measure, we will assume that the central angle is consistent throughout the problem.
   - Let's assume the central angle is \(2x\) units.

6. **Using the Given Probability:**
   - The problem states that the probability of the angle subtended by the arc \(AC\) at the circumference being \(1\) or \(2\) units is \(\frac{5}{12}\).
   - This implies that the angle measure \(x\) must be such that the probability is \(\frac{5}{12}\).

7. **Solving for \(x\):**
   - Since the probability is \(\frac{5}{12}\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{5}{12} = \frac{1}{2}

   - Solving for \(x\), we get:

   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle subtended by the arc \(AC\).
   - Since the central angle is \(2x\), we have:

     \angle ADC = 2x = 2 \times \frac{1}{2} = 1

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Identify the given information:
   - 8 cm = 3 inches
   - 6 cm = 3 inches

2. Determine the conversion factor from centimeters to inches. From the given information, we can see that 8 cm is equivalent to 3 inches. Therefore, the conversion factor is:
   \[
   \text{Conversion factor} = \frac{3 \text{ inches}}{8 \text{ cm}}

4. To find out how many inches are in 12 cm, we multiply 12 cm by the conversion factor:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"Given the equation:

\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

we start by simplifying the expression inside the cube root. Notice that:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, we cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube root:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 16^3
\]

Calculating \(16^3\):

\[
16^3 = 16 \times 16 \times 16 = 256 \times 16 = 4096
\]

So, we have:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get two possible solutions:

\[
x - 2 = \sqrt{4096} \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -\sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

Solving these equations for \(x\):

\[

First, observe that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \pi + \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the measure of \( \angle BAC \) given that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = 2\theta \). Since \( AB = AC \), \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = 90^\circ - \theta \). The point \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), so \( BM = MC \).

Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = 1 \). Let's place the triangle in the coordinate plane with \( A \) at \( (0, 11) \), \( B \) at \( (-x, 0) \), and \( C \) at \( (x, 0) \). Then \( M \) is at \( (0, 0) \).

Using the distance formula, we have:
\[ AM = \sqrt{0^2 + 11^2} = 11. \]
\[ AD = \sqrt{0^2 + (11-10)^2} = 1. \]

Now, let's use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC = 6\theta \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \), we can use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \) and \( \triangle ABD \).

In \( \triangle ABD \), we have:
\[ \angle ABD = 90^\circ - \theta, \]
\[ \angle BAD = \theta, \]
\[ \angle ADB = 180^\circ - (90^\circ - \theta) - \theta = 90^\circ. \]

In \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[ \angle BDC = 6\theta, \]
\[ \angle DBC = 90^\circ - \theta, \]
\[ \angle DCB = 90^\circ - \theta. \]

Since \( \angle BDC = 6\theta \) and \( \angle BDC = 180^\circ - \angle DBC - \angle DCB = 180^\circ - 2(90^\circ - \theta) = 2\theta \), we have:
\[ 6\theta = 2\theta + 2\theta, \]
which is consistent.

Now, we need to find \( \theta \). Using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we have:
\[ 6\theta = 3 \cdot 2\theta, \]
which is true. Therefore, \( \theta = 18^\circ \).

Thus, \( \angle BAC = 2\theta = 2 \cdot 18^\circ = 36^\circ \).

4. ** argument of the complex number:**

   Let \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \). The domain of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers, i.e., \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

2. **Analyze the function:**
   Notice that \( f(x) \) is an even function because \( f(-x) = (-x)^4 + 4(-x)^2 = x^4 + 4x^2 = f(x) \). Therefore, it is symmetric about the y-axis.

3. **Find the minimum value of \( f(x) \):**
   To find the minimum value, we take the derivative of \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f'(x) = 4x^3 + 8x = 4x(x^2 + 2)
   \]
   Setting the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:
   \[
   4x(x^2 + 2) = 0

     Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:

     y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}

     This gives the roots:
     \[
     y = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = -7

\[

\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the second given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we get:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}) = s^3 - 72.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

The inequality becomes:

First, recall the definition of sine in a right triangle. The sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin R = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}

We can distribute the \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) inside the parentheses:
\[ y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} x^2 - \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \]

Next, we rationalize the denominators of the fractions:

(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
We can write similar equations for the distances to \( C, D, E, \) and \( F \):
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 = 144
\]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step. First, subtract the equation for the distance to \( A \) from the equation for the distance to \( B \):
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Next, subtract the equation for the distance to \( C \) from the equation for the distance to \( D \):
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2) = 81 - 64
\]
\[
(y+1)^2 - (y-1)^2 = 17
\]
\[
(y^2 + 2y + 1) - (y^2 - 2y + 1) = 17
\]
\[
4y = 17
\]
\[
y = \frac{17}{4}
\]

Finally, subtract the equation for the distance to \( E \) from the equation for the distance to \( F \):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2) = 144 - 121
\]
\[
(z+1)^2 - (z-1)^2 = 23
\]
\[
(z^2 + 2z + 1) - (z^2 - 2z + 1) = 23
\]
\[
4z = 23
\]
\[
z = \frac{23}{4}
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \( P \) are:

" polar equation \( r = 1 - \cos \theta \) represents a specific type of curve known as alima curve or a rose curve. Let's analyze the given equation step by step to understand its shape and properties.

1. **Understanding the Equation:**
   The given polar equation is \( r = 1 - \cos \theta \).

2. **Symmetry:**
   To determine the symmetry, we check if the curve is symmetric about the polar axis (theta = 0), the vertical axis (theta = \pi/2), or the origin (theta = \pi).

   - **Symmetry about the polar axis (theta = 0):**
     Replace \(\theta\) with \(-\theta\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(-\theta) = 1 - \cos \theta
     \]
     The equation remains unchanged, so the curve is symmetric about the polar axis.

   - **Symmetry about the vertical axis (theta = \pi/2):**
     Replace \(\theta\) with \(\pi - \theta\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(\pi - \theta) = 1 - (-\cos \theta) = 1 + \cos \theta
     \]
     The equation changes, so the curve is not symmetric about the vertical axis.

   - **Symmetry about the origin (theta = \pi):**
     Replace \(\theta\) with \(\pi + \theta\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(\pi + \theta) = 1 - (-\cos \theta) = 1 + \cos \theta
     \]
     The equation changes, so the curve is not symmetric about the origin.

3. **Key Points:**
   To plot the curve, we can find some key points by substituting specific values of \(\theta\):

   - When \(\theta = 0\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(0) = 1 - 1 = 0
     \]
     Point: \((0, 0)\)

   - When \(\theta = \pi\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(\pi) = 1 - (-1) = 2
     \]
     Point: \((2, \pi)\)

   - When \(\theta = \pi/2\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(\pi/2) = 1 - 0 = 1
     \]
     Point: \((1, \pi/2)\)

   - When \(\theta = 3\pi/2\):
     \[
     r = 1 - \cos(3\pi/2) = 1 - 0 = 1
     \]
     Point: \((1, 3\pi/2)\)

4. ** shape:**
   The curve \( r = 1 - \cos \theta \) is alima curve, which is a type of rose curve with 2 petals. It is symmetric about the polar axis and has a maximum radius of 2 at \(\theta = \pi\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\[

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

Thus, we have:

\]
The sum of the roots of this polynomial taken two at a time is given by the coefficient of \(x^4\) in the polynomial \(P(x)\), which is the sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time. This sum is:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 6 \cdot 2 = 12.

\]
This simplifies to:

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we have:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_4 = 12.

"Given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as the center of the square, and the ratio \(AB/AD = k\), we need to find the relationship between the diagonals of the quadrilateral and the side lengths.

First, let's denote the side lengths of the quadrilateral as follows:
- \(AB = a\)
- \(AD = b\)
- \(AB/AD = k \implies a = kb\)

Since \(O\) is the center of the square, the diagonals of the square are equal and bisect each other at right angles. The diagonals of the square are also the diagonals of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\).

The length of the diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. If the side length of the square is \(s\), then the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[ d = s\sqrt{2} \]

Since \(O\) is the center of the square, the distance from \(O\) to any vertex of the square is half the length of the diagonal:
\[ \text{Distance from } O \text{ to any vertex} = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{s}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Now, let's consider the diagonals of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\). The diagonals of the quadrilateral are the line segments connecting opposite vertices. Since \(O\) is the center of the square, the diagonals of the quadrilateral are also the diagonals of the square.

Therefore, the diagonals of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) are equal and each is equal to the diagonal of the square:
\[ \text{Diagonals of } ABCD = s\sqrt{2} \]

Since the diagonals of the quadrilateral are equal, the relationship between the diagonals and the side lengths is:
\[ \text{Diagonals of } ABCD = \sqrt{2} \times \text{side length of the square} \]

Given that the side length of the square is \(s\), the relationship between the diagonals and the side lengths is:
\[ \text{Diagonals of } ABCD = \sqrt{2} \times s \]

Since the side length of the square is not given explicitly, we can express the relationship in terms of the side lengths \(a\) and \(b\). However, since \(a = kb\), the relationship between the diagonals and the side lengths is:
\[ \text{Diagonals of } ABCD = \sqrt{2} \times s \]

"To determine the average amount of money each person earned, we need to follow these steps:

1. Add up the amounts of money earned by each person.

- Solanki: \$27.47
- Shriya: \$35.23
- Janvitya: \$37.37

"To solve for \( n \) in the given problem, we need to analyze the relationships between the numbers in the grid. The grid is structured such that each row and each column forms an arithmetic sequence. Let's denote the numbers in the grid as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
g & h & i \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

From the problem, we know the following values:
- \( a = n-3 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = n+1 \)
- \( d = n+2 \)
- \( e = 2n-9 \)
- \( f = 1 \)
- \( g = 2 \)
- \( h = n \)
- \( i = n-1 \)

Since each row and each column forms an arithmetic sequence, we can use the properties of arithmetic sequences to find \( n \).

First, let's consider the first row:
\[ a, b, c \]
This is an arithmetic sequence, so the common difference \( d_1 \) is:
\[ d_1 = b - a = 3 - (n-3) = 6 - n \]
\[ d_1 = c - b = (n+1) - 3 = n - 2 \]
Setting these equal gives:
\[ 6 - n = n - 2 \]
\[ 6 + 2 = n + n \]
\[ 8 = 2n \]
\[ n = 4 \]

Now, let's verify this value of \( n \) by checking the other rows and columns. For the second row:
\[ d, e, f \]
This is an arithmetic sequence, so the common difference \( d_2 \) is:
\[ d_2 = e - d = (2n-9) - (n+2) = n - 11 \]
\[ d_2 = f - e = 1 - (2n-9) = 10 - 2n \]
Setting these equal gives:
\[ n - 11 = 10 - 2n \]
\[ n + 2n = 10 + 11 \]
\[ 3n = 21 \]
\[ n = 7 \]
But we already found \( n = 4 \), so let's check the third row:
\[ g, h, i \]
This is an arithmetic sequence, so the common difference \( d_3 \) is:
\[ d_3 = h - g = n - 2 \]
\[ d_3 = i - h = (n-1) - n = -1 \]
Setting these equal gives:
\[ n - 2 = -1 \]
\[ n = 1 \]
But we already found \( n = 4 \), so let's check the first column:
\[ a, d, g \]
This is an arithmetic sequence, so the common difference \( d_4 \) is:
\[ d_4 = d - a = (n+2) - (n-3) = 5 \]
\[ d_4 = g - d = 2 - (n+2) = -n \]
Setting these equal gives:
\[ 5 = -n \]
\[ n = -5 \]
But we already found \( n = 4 \), so let's check the second column:
\[ b, e, h \]
This is an arithmetic sequence, so the common difference \( d_5 \) is:
\[ d_5 = e - b = (2n-9) - 3 = 2n - 12 \]
\[ d_5 = h - e = n - (2n-9) = -n + 9 \]
Setting these equal gives:
\[ 2n - 12 = -n + 9 \]
\[ 2n + n = 9 + 12 \]
\[ 3n = 21 \]
\[ n = 7 \]
But we already found \( n = 4 \), so let's check the third column:
\[ c, f, i \]
This is an arithmetic sequence, so the common difference \( d_6 \) is:
\[ d_6 = f - c = 1 - (n+1) = -n \]
\[ d_6 = i - f = (n-1) - 1 = n - 2 \]
Setting these equal gives:
\[ -n = n - 2 \]
\[ -n - n = -2 \]
\[ -2n = -2 \]
\[ n = 1 \]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's simplify each term separately. Consider the term \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\). We can multiply the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate of the denominator, which is \(1 + \omega^2\), because \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) and \(\omega = -1 - \omega^2\).

Now, let's add the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3}.
\]
Since \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), the denominator simplifies to:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 0 = 2.
\]
The numerator simplifies to:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]
Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{2}.
\]
So, the value of the given expression is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",1,"[1, '1']",True
" polar coordinates $(r, \theta)$ 和笛卡尔坐标 $(x, y)$ 之间的关系由以下公式给出：
\[ x = r \cos \theta \]
\[ y = r \sin \theta \]

给定 $x = 3$ 和 $y = -3$，我们可以将这些值代入公式中找到 $r$ 和 $\theta$。

首先，我们计算 $r$：
\[ r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2} \]

接下来，我们计算 $\theta$：
\[ \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{3}\right) = \tan^{-1}(-1) \]
由于 $x = 3$ 和 $y = -3$，点 $(3, -3)$ 位于第四象限。$\tan^{-1}(-1)$ 的主值是 $-\frac{\pi}{4}$，但由于我们正在寻找区间 $[0, 2\pi)$ 内的正角，我们加上 $2\pi$：
\[ \theta = 2\pi - \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{8\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{7\pi}{4} \]

因此，极坐标 $(r, \theta)$ 是：
\[ (r, \theta) = \left(3\sqrt{2}, \frac{7\pi}{4}\right) \]

最终答案是：
\[ \boxed{\left(3\sqrt{2}, \frac{7\pi}{4}\right)} \]","[Interval.open(3*sqrt(2), (7*pi)/4), '(3\\sqrt{2}, \\frac{7\\pi}{4})']",13,"[13, '13']",False
