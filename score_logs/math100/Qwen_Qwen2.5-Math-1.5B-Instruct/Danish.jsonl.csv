"To solve for the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We are given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(D\) as \(EF\) and the hypotenuse as \(DE\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(DE\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the result \( w \) when \( z \) is rotated around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i

   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)

   z' = \sqrt{2} - (3\sqrt{2} + 3 - 3)i
   \]
   \[
   z' = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

First, let's factorize 242:
- 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
  \[
  242 \div 2 = 121
  \]
  So, we have:
  \[
  242 = 2 \times 121
  \]

Next, we factorize 121:
- 121 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.
- 121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- To check if 121 is divisible by 7, we perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]
  So, 121 is not divisible by 7.
- To check if 121 is divisible by 11, we perform the division:
  \[
  121 \div 11 = 11
  \]
  So, we have:
  \[
  121 = 11 \times 11
  \]

Now, we combine the factors:
\[
242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
\]

We can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factors:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}
\]

Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify:
\[
\sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2}
\]

The square root of \(11^2\) is 11:
\[
\sqrt{11^2} = 11
\]

Therefore:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

The simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to assign 8 people to 3 teams where the teams are indistinguishable and the order of the teams does not matter, we can use the concept of partitions of a set, specifically the Stirling numbers of the second kind and then account for the indistinguishability of the teams.

First, we calculate the number of ways to partition 8 people into 3 non-empty teams. This is given by the Stirling number of the second kind, \( S(8, 3) \). The Stirling number of the second kind \( S(n, k) \) is the number of ways to partition a set of \( n \) objects into \( k \) non-empty subsets. The formula for \( S(n, k) \) is:

\[ S(n, k) = \frac{1}{k!} \sum_{j=0}^{k} (-1)^{k-j} \binom{k}{j} j^n \]

For \( S(8, 3) \):

\[ S(8, 3) = \frac{1}{3!} \left( 3^8 - 3 \cdot 2^8 + 3 \cdot 1^8 \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 6561 - 3 \cdot 256 + 3 \cdot 1 \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 6561 - 768 + 3 \right) = \frac{1}{6} \left( 5796 \right) = 966 \]

This gives us the number of ways to partition 8 people into 3 non-empty teams. However, since the teams are indistinguishable, we do not need to multiply by the number of permutations of the teams. Therefore, the number of ways to assign 8 people to 3 indistinguishable teams is simply \( S(8, 3) = 966 \).

Thus, the number of ways to assign 8 people to 3 teams where the teams are indistinguishable and the order of the teams does not matter is:

\[ \boxed{966} \]","[966, '966']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression for \(T_k\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{3}\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) into the expression:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = -\frac{1000}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

So, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 becomes:

Now, calculate the product:

\[
4 \times 6 = 24

\[

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the concept of rotating a figure around its center and how many degrees we need to rotate it so that it looks the same as it did before. In this case, we are dealing with a figure that has rotational symmetry, and we need to find the smallest number of degrees that we can rotate it by so that it looks exactly the same.

A figure with rotational symmetry can be rotated by a certain number of degrees and still look the same. For a figure with rotational symmetry of order \( n \), the smallest angle of rotation that will make the figure look the same is \( \frac{360^\circ}{n} \).

In this problem, the figure is a pentagon (5 sides), so the order of rotational symmetry is 5. Therefore, the smallest angle of rotation that will make the pentagon look the same is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

So, the smallest number of degrees that we can rotate the pentagon by so that it looks exactly the same is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), and the condition that \(x > 7\). We will use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\) should be the same as the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6

\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1

x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2
\]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the Horizontal Asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

- The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1.
- The degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have found \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these together:

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5
\]

"To compute \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the calculation. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to handle.

First, observe that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99(99 + 1) + 1 = 99 \cdot 100 + 1.\]

Now, we can calculate \(99 \cdot 100 + 1\):
\[99 \cdot 100 = 9900,\]
and adding 1 to 9900 gives:
\[9900 + 1 = 9901.\]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 28}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}
\]
The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues, so the largest singular value is:

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we need to understand the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This is because multiplying 1 by itself any number of times will always result in 1.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the base and the exponent in the expression \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\).
   - The base is 1.
   - The exponent is \(2^{235423523}\).

2. Apply the property of exponents that states \(a^b = 1\) if \(a = 1\) for any real number \(b\).
   - Here, the base \(a\) is 1, and the exponent \(b\) is \(2^{235423523}\).

3. Since the base is 1, raising 1 to any power will always result in 1.

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(z\) is a fifth root of unity, which means \(z^5 = 1\) and \(z \neq 1\). The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). This implies that \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we use the fact that \(z^5 = 1\), which implies \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\), \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\), and \(z^2 = \frac{1}{z^3}\). Therefore, \(\frac{1}{z} = z^4\), \(\frac{1}{z^2} = z^3\), and \(\frac{1}{z^3} = z^2\).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.\]

From the equation \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\), we can isolate \(z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3\) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, we subtract the two base 10 numbers:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks are equivalent to one goolee in terms of weight. Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that one treek and one goolee together weigh the same as two treeks. This can be written as:
   \[
   \text{1 treek} + \text{1 goolee} = \text{2 treeks}
   \]

2. We also know that one treek and one goolee together weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   \text{1 treek} + \text{1 goolee} = \text{1 squig}
   \]

3. From the above two equations, we can see that:
   \[
   \text{2 treeks} = \text{1 squig}
   \]

4. To find out how many treeks are equivalent to one goolee, we can use the first equation and substitute the value of one treek from the second equation. From the second equation, we know that:
   \[
   \text{1 treek} = \text{1 squig} - \text{1 goolee}
   \]

5. Substitute this value of one treek into the first equation:
   \[
   \text{1 squig} - \text{1 goolee} + \text{1 goolee} = \text{2 treeks}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{1 squig} = \text{2 treeks}

6. Therefore, one squig is equivalent to two treeks. Since one squig is also equivalent to one treek and one goolee, we can conclude that:
   \[
   \text{1 treek} + \text{1 goolee} = \text{2 treeks}

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)

Expanding each term separately:

\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we verify our values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into equations 2 and 3:

For equation 2:

\[
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26

\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8

where \( V \) is the volume, \( r \) is the radius, and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. Initially, the volume of the tank is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters. After the tank is filled with water, the volume of the water is still \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, but the height of the water column is reduced by the volume of the water that was displaced by the steel ball.

The volume of the steel ball is given by the formula for the volume of a sphere:

\[ V_{\text{ball}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r_{\text{ball}}^3 \]

where \( r_{\text{ball}} \) is the radius of the steel ball. Since the volume of the water displaced by the steel ball is equal to the volume of the steel ball, we have:

\[ \frac{4}{3} \pi r_{\text{ball}}^3 = 20\pi - 20\pi = 0 \]

This indicates that the volume of the water displaced by the steel ball is actually the volume of the water that was originally in the tank, which is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters. However, the problem states that after the tank is filled with water, the volume of the water is still \( 20\pi \) cubic meters, but the height of the water column is reduced by the volume of the water that was displaced by the steel ball. This implies that the volume of the water that was displaced by the steel ball is actually the volume of the steel ball itself, which is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters.

Therefore, we can set up the equation for the volume of the steel ball as follows:

\[ \frac{4}{3} \pi r_{\text{ball}}^3 = 20\pi \]

\[ r_{\text{ball}}^3 = 15 \]

"To determine the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). The function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(ax^2\) is \(a^3\) at \(x = a\). For \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(ax^2\) is \(a^3\) at \(x = a\).

Next, let's consider the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). The function \(ax + 2a\) is a straight line with slope \(a\). For \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and for \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(3a\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, the value of the function at \(x = a\) for the linear part must be less than or equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\) for the quadratic part. This means:
\[ 3a \leq a^3. \]

We solve the inequality \(3a \leq a^3\):
\[ a^3 - 3a \geq 0, \]
\[ a(a^2 - 3) \geq 0. \]

The solutions to this inequality are:
\[ a \leq -\sqrt{3} \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq \sqrt{3}. \]

Since we are looking for the largest possible value of \(a\), we choose \(a = \sqrt{3}\).

To verify, if \(a = \sqrt{3}\), then the function becomes:

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(f(x)) = x\). A fixed point of \(f(f(x)) = x\) is a point \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):

\[f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]

We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):

\[\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.\]

This equation can be factored as:

\[x \left( \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 \right) = 0.\]

This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\).
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\).

For the first case, \(x = 0\) is a solution, but it is a fixed point of \(f(x)\), so we need to check the second case. Let's solve \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\).

Expanding the left-hand side, we get:

\[\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3).\]

So the equation becomes:

\[\lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.\]

This is a cubic equation in \(x\):

\[-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.\]

For \(x\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need to check the values of \(\lambda\) that allow this equation to have a solution in \([0,1]\) other than \(x = 0\). By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we can see that for \(\lambda = 2\), the function \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x)\) has a fixed point at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x = 0\) and \(x = 1\).

\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos x = \sin (90^\circ - x)\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) and the terms \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are non-negative, which implies that \( f(x, y) \) is bounded by the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

To find the maximum value, we can consider specific values of \( x \) and \( y \). Let's try \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
We need to maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). Let \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) formed by the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\|
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\).

The cross product \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{i} \begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} - \mathbf{j} \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} + \mathbf{k} \begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -2 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Now, we compute each of the 2x2 determinants:

\[
\begin{vmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = (2)(1) - (3)(-2) = 2 + 6 = 8
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 3 \\ -3 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = (1)(1) - (3)(-3) = 1 + 9 = 10
\]

\[
\begin{vmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ -3 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = (1)(-2) - (2)(-3) = -2 + 6 = 4
\]

Substituting these values back into the expression for the cross product, we get:

\[
\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the vector \(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}\| = \frac{1}{2} \times 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \).

The golden ratio \( \phi \) satisfies the quadratic equation \( x^2 - \phi x + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are \( \phi \) and \( \frac{1}{\phi} \). Since \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{(1 + \sqrt{5})(1 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{2(1 - \sqrt{5})}{-4} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \).

Thus, \( z \) can be either \( \phi \) or \( \frac{1}{\phi} \). We will consider \( z = \phi \) and find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). The same result will hold if we consider \( z = \frac{1}{\phi} \).

The golden ratio \( \phi \) has the property that \( \phi^n + \frac{1}{\phi^n} \) is an integer for any integer \( n \). We can use the recurrence relation for powers of \( \phi \). Specifically, we know that \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \), so \( \phi^n + \frac{1}{\phi^n} \) can be expressed in terms of \( \phi \) and \( \frac{1}{\phi} \).

We start by finding the first few powers of \( \phi \):
\[ \phi^1 = \phi, \]
\[ \phi^2 = \phi + 1, \]
\[ \phi^3 = \phi \cdot \phi^2 = \phi(\phi + 1) = \phi^2 + \phi = (\phi + 1) + \phi = 2\phi + 1, \]
\[ \phi^4 = \phi \cdot \phi^3 = \phi(2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2. \]

We observe that \( \phi^n + \frac{1}{\phi^n} \) follows the Fibonacci sequence. Specifically, if we let \( F_n \) be the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number, then \( \phi^n + \frac{1}{\phi^n} = F_{2n} \). The Fibonacci sequence is defined by \( F_0 = 0 \), \( F_1 = 1 \), and \( F_{n} = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n \geq 2 \).

Therefore, \( \phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} = F_{170} \). The 170th Fibonacci number is a very large number, but we do not need to compute it explicitly to answer the problem. We only need to recognize that it is the 170th Fibonacci number.

Thus, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{F_{170}}. \]","[F_{170}, 'F_{170}']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to use properties of medians and the fact that the line through the centroid parallel to a side of the triangle divides the triangle into two regions of equal area.

First, let's recall that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. Also, the centroid divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area.

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of each of the smaller triangles formed by the medians (i.e., triangles \(AGB\), \(BGC\), and \(CGA\)) is \(\frac{144}{3} = 48\).

Now, consider the line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\). This line will intersect \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line of parallelism. Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, and thus the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the line \(MN\) divides triangle \(ABC\) into two regions: a smaller triangle \(AMN\) and a trapezoid \(MNCB\). The area of the trapezoid \(MNCB\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\), which is \(144 - 64 = 80\).

The line \(MN\) also divides the median \(AD\) in the same ratio as it divides the triangle, which is 2:1. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), and the area of triangle \(AMN\) is 64.

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, the line \(MN\) divides triangle \(ABC\) into two regions: a smaller triangle \(AMN\) and a trapezoid \(MNCB\). The area of the trapezoid \(MNCB\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\), which is \(144 - 64 = 80\).

Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\), and the area of triangle \(AMN\) is 64.

"To determine the middle term of the arithmetic series, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given terms:**
   - The first term (\(a_1\)) is 200.
   - The last term (\(a_n\)) is 500.

2. **Understand the properties of an arithmetic series:**
   - In an arithmetic series, the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the common difference (\(d\)).
   - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic series can be expressed as:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
     \]

3. **Set up the equation for the last term:**
   - We know \(a_n = 500\), \(a_1 = 200\), and we need to find \(d\) and \(n\).
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     500 = 200 + (n-1)d
     \]

4. **Solve for \(d\):**
   - Rearrange the equation to isolate \(d\):
     \[
     500 - 200 = (n-1)d
     \]
     \[
     300 = (n-1)d
     \]
     \[
     d = \frac{300}{n-1}
     \]

5. **Determine the number of terms (\(n\)):**
   - Since we are looking for the middle term, \(n\) must be an odd number. Let’s assume \(n\) is odd and find the middle term.
   - The middle term of an arithmetic series with an odd number of terms is the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th term.

6. **Find the middle term:**
   - The middle term (\(a_{\frac{n+1}{2}}\)) can be found using the formula for the \(k\)-th term:
     \[
     a_k = a_1 + (k-1)d
     \]
   - Substitute \(k = \frac{n+1}{2}\):
     \[
     a_{\frac{n+1}{2}} = 200 + \left(\frac{n+1}{2} - 1\right)d
     \]
     \[
     a_{\frac{n+1}{2}} = 200 + \left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right)d
     \]

7. **Substitute \(d\) back into the equation:**
   - Recall \(d = \frac{300}{n-1}\):
     \[
     a_{\frac{n+1}{2}} = 200 + \left(\frac{n-1}{2}\right) \left(\frac{300}{n-1}\right)

     \[
     a_{\frac{n+1}{2}} = 200 + \frac{300}{2}

"To determine if H Christmas tree is Christmas tree af 100 and 150, we need to check if the height of the tree is between 100 and 150 cm. Let's assume the height of the tree is given or can be measured. For the sake of this problem, let's assume the height of the tree is 120 cm.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the range of heights we are checking against: 100 cm to 150 cm.
2. Compare the height of the tree to this range. If the height is greater than or equal to 100 cm and less than or equal to 150 cm, then the tree is af 100 and 150.

Since the height of the tree is 120 cm, we can see that:

"To determine the smallest positive integer \( n \) such that \( n^{\text{th}} \) power of 2 is greater than \( 2^{24} \), we need to find the smallest \( n \) for which \( 2^n > 2^{24} \).

First, let's rewrite the inequality:
\[ 2^n > 2^{24} \]

Since the bases are the same, we can compare the exponents directly:
\[ n > 24 \]

The smallest integer greater than 24 is 25. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) that satisfies the inequality is:

\[ 2^{25} = 33,554,432 \]

Clearly, \( 2^{25} > 2^{24} \), confirming that our solution is correct.

"To determine the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line given by the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

First, let's identify the dimensions of the rectangles. The larger rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. The smaller rectangle that is cut out has a width of 2 units and a height of 4 units.

The area of the larger rectangle is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Area of the larger rectangle} = \text{width} \times \text{height} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ square units}

The area of the smaller rectangle is calculated as follows:

"To determine the smallest positive multiple of 450 that has no zeros and no digits larger than 9, we need to find the smallest number that is a multiple of 450 and consists only of the digits 1 through 9.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A multiple of 450 must include these prime factors. We need to find the smallest number that meets the criteria of having no zeros and no digits larger than 9, and is a multiple of 450.

Let's start by checking the smallest multiples of 450:

We need to check each of these numbers to see if they meet the criteria. Let's start with 9900:
\[ 9900 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \times 11 \]
This number has a digit 11, which is not allowed. So, 9900 is not a valid number.

Next, let's check 9990:
\[ 9990 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \times 37 \]
This number has a digit 37, which is not allowed. So, 9990 is not a valid number.

Next, let's check 9999:
\[ 9999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \]
This number has digits 9 and 101, which are not allowed. So, 9999 is not a valid number.

Next, let's check 99999:
\[ 99999 = 3^2 \times 41 \times 271 \]
This number has digits 9 and 271, which are not allowed. So, 99999 is not a valid number.

Next, let's check 9999999:
\[ 9999999 = 3^3 \times 7 \times 11 \times 13 \times 37 \times 101 \]
This number has digits 9 and 101, which are not allowed. So, 9999999 is not a valid number.

Next, let's check 99999999:
\[ 99999999 = 3^2 \times 11 \times 101 \times 10001 \]

"To solve this problem, we need to find a number that satisfies two conditions:
1. When divided by 4, the remainder is 1, 2, or 3.
2. When divided by 5, the remainder is 1, 2, or 3.

Let's denote the number we are looking for by \( x \).

### Step 1: Analyze the first condition
The first condition can be written as:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \]

This means that \( x \) can be written in the form:
\[ x = 4k + 1 \]
\[ x = 4k + 2 \]
\[ x = 4k + 3 \]
for some integer \( k \).

### Step 2: Analyze the second condition
The second condition can be written as:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]

This means that \( x \) can be written in the form:
\[ x = 5m + 1 \]
\[ x = 5m + 2 \]
\[ x = 5m + 3 \]
for some integer \( m \).

### Step 3: Find a common solution
We need to find a number \( x \) that satisfies both sets of congruences. Let's start by considering the first set of congruences:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{4} \]
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{4} \]

This means that \( x \) can be written in the form:
\[ x = 4k + 1 \]
\[ x = 4k + 2 \]
\[ x = 4k + 3 \]

Now, let's consider the second set of congruences:
\[ x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
\[ x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]

This means that \( x \) can be written in the form:
\[ x = 5m + 1 \]
\[ x = 5m + 2 \]
\[ x = 5m + 3 \]

We need to find a common solution to these congruences. Let's start by checking the smallest values of \( x \) that satisfy the first set of congruences:
\[ x = 1, 2, 3 \pmod{4} \]

Now, let's check these values modulo 5:
- For \( x = 1 \):
  \[ 1 \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \]
  This satisfies the second set of congruences.

- For \( x = 2 \):
  \[ 2 \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \]
  This satisfies the second set of congruences.

- For \( x = 3 \):
  \[ 3 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \]
  This satisfies the second set of congruences.

Therefore, the smallest number that satisfies both sets of congruences is \( x = 1 \).

### Step 4: Verify the solution
Let's verify that \( x = 1 \) satisfies both conditions:
- When divided by 4:
  \[ 1 \div 4 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
  This satisfies \( x \equiv 1 \pmod{4} \).

- When divided by 5:
  \[ 1 \div 5 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
  This satisfies \( x \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).

Thus, the number that satisfies both conditions is \( x = 1 \).

The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can rewrite this as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}

Next, we perform the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This gives us the decimal representation:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ

Next, we use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to simplify \(\sin 120^\circ\) and \(\sin 160^\circ\):

\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ

So the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 20^\circ

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). So the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\cos 10^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines and cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). This gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

So the original expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product:

\[

"To determine the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we know that the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial of the form \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). Here, \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x+5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x+5) = 0 \).

\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]

Similarly, for \(\csc^2 20^\circ\) and \(\csc^2 40^\circ\), we use the identity for cosecant:
\[
\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Now, substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Combine the constants:
\[
= 1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the identity for cotangent in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}
\]
Thus:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

We need to find a way to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\). Notice that:
\[
\tan 20^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 10^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \tan (30^\circ + 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ + \tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]

However, these identities are complex to handle directly. Instead, we use a known result from trigonometric identities:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} = 12
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 12 = 15

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The formula is:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

Next, we solve for \( n \). First, we divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore, we have:

\[
n-2 = 6

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[
(t + 2)t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

First, expand and simplify the congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic congruence of the form \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). We will solve this using the quadratic formula:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{23}
\]

Substitute \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the formula:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}
\]
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23}
\]
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need an integer \( x \) such that:
\[
x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such a square root. After testing, we find:
\[
6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
7^2 = 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
8^2 = 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}

\[
10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

Thus, \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \).

Substitute \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \) back into the quadratic formula:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \pmod{23}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \equiv \frac{8}{2} \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \equiv \frac{-12}{2} \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}

We need to check which of these solutions satisfy the original condition \( 0 < t < 23 \):
\[
t = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = 17

   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:

   V = s^3

   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any non-zero real number \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines, we first need to confirm that the lines are indeed parallel. The direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We observe that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so the lines are parallel.

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:
\[ d = \frac{|\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{n}|}{\|\mathbf{n}\|} \]
where \(\mathbf{a}\) is a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{n}\) is the cross product of the direction vectors of the lines.

Let's choose the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) from the first and second lines, respectively. The vector \(\mathbf{a}\) is:
\[ \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \]

The direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product \(\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\) is:
\[ \mathbf{n} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(-4) - (-2)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(-4) - (-2)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(-18) - (-9)(4)) \]
\[ = \mathbf{i}(36 - 36) - \mathbf{j}(-8 + 8) + \mathbf{k}(-36 + 36) = \mathbf{i}(0) - \mathbf{j}(0) + \mathbf{k}(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \]

Since the direction vectors are parallel, the cross product is the zero vector, which means we need to use a different approach. Instead, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space, which is the magnitude of the projection of \(\mathbf{a}\) onto \(\mathbf{n}\), where \(\mathbf{n}\) is a vector perpendicular to both direction vectors. However, since the direction vectors are parallel, we can use the fact that the distance is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line.

We can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in 3D space:
\[ d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} \]

First, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[ \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7(-2) - 5(-9)) - \mathbf{j}(-8(-2) - 5(2)) + \mathbf{k}(-8(-9) - 7(2)) \]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is:
\[ \|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361} \]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\) is:
\[ \|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89} \]

The distance \(d\) is:
\[ d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7 \]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[

\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -2 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

Now, we can substitute these into our simplified expression:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

"Given trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), and the area of the trapezoid \([ABCD] = 42\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid from \(A\) to \(BC\) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of the trapezoid, so \(h = AC\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), let \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\). This means that \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta\) and \(\angle BCA = 90^\circ - \theta\).

The area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
So,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Now, let's consider \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

Since \(h = AC\) is the height of the trapezoid, we can express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\) using the area of the trapezoid:
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting \(h\) into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

To find the exact value of \([\triangle ACD]\), we need to recognize that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is a fraction of the area of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the height \(h\) is the same for both \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is exactly half the area of the trapezoid because \(\overline{AC}\) is the height and it splits the trapezoid into two triangles of equal area when considering the symmetry and the given conditions.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation definition to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the operation definition, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of the numerators \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[

Now, we multiply the result by 70:

"To determine the condition under which the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) on the circumference of a circle.

Given that \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) are points on the circumference of a circle, we can use the concept of cyclic quadrilaterals. A cyclic quadrilateral is a quadrilateral whose vertices all lie on a single circle. For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) must form a cyclic quadrilateral.

The condition for two line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect is that the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) must be such that they form a cyclic quadrilateral. This means that the points must lie on the circumference of a single circle.

Therefore, the condition for the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect is that the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) are concyclic, i.e., they lie on the same circle.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometry of the situation.

We have two circles with centers \(D\) and radii 1 and 2, respectively. The smaller circle has radius 1 and the larger circle has radius 2. The circles intersect at points \(A\) and \(C\), and the line segment \(AC\) is a common chord of both circles.

The area of the region between the two circles (the annular region) is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\). Therefore, the area of the annular region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The area of the larger circle minus the area of the smaller circle is:
\[
4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]

Since the area of the annular region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), we can set up the equation:
\[
3\pi - \text{Area of the smaller segment} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
This implies that the area of the smaller segment is:
\[
3\pi - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{9\pi}{3} - \frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{4\pi}{3}
\]

The area of the smaller segment can also be calculated as the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi
\]
where \(\theta\) is the central angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]
So, the area of the smaller segment is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]
We know this area is \(\frac{4\pi}{3}\), so we have:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{4\pi}{3}
\]
Multiplying through by 360 to clear the denominator, we get:
\[
\theta \pi - 180 \sin \theta = 480\pi
\]
Dividing through by \(\pi\), we get:
\[
\theta - 180 \frac{\sin \theta}{\pi} = 480
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = \sin 120^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we substitute this value in:
\[
\theta - 180 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2\pi} = 480
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
\theta - 90\sqrt{3} = 480
\]
Since \(\sqrt{3} \approx 1.732\), we have:
\[
\theta - 90 \times 1.732 = 480
\]
\[
\theta - 155.88 = 480
\]
\[
\theta = 480 + 155.88 = 635.88

"To determine how much more water is needed to fill the larger tank, we need to calculate the volumes of both the smaller and the larger tanks and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the volume of the smaller tank. The smaller tank is a cylinder with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the smaller tank:
\[ V_{\text{small}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the larger tank. The larger tank is also a cylinder with a height of 8 cm and a radius of 6 cm. Using the same volume formula:
\[ V_{\text{large}} = \pi (6)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 36 \cdot 8 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we find the difference in volume between the larger tank and the smaller tank:
\[ V_{\text{difference}} = V_{\text{large}} - V_{\text{small}} = 288\pi - 72\pi = 216\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.
\]

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.

"To determine the number of ways to select 5 members from a group of 8 republians and 6 demokrater such that at least one member is selected from each group, we can use the principle of complementary counting.

First, calculate the total number of ways to select 5 members from 14 people:
\[

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), we have \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Then, \( BC = 2x \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \), we have:

Substitute this into the equation:

First, let's rewrite the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2.\]
We can complete the square for the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\):

This transformation is useful because it allows us to analyze the expression more easily. Now, we need to solve the inequality:

\[0 < x^2 + 2 < 5.\]
Subtracting 2 from all parts of the inequality, we get:

Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the left part of the inequality \(-2 < x^2\) is always true. Therefore, we only need to consider the right part:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express \(x+y = s-z\), \(y+z = s-x\), and \(z+x = s-y\). Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,
\]
or:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
so:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72,
\]
so:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
and:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

First, let's calculate the percentage of bus passengers who were correct in their projections for each klasy.

For the 9th klasy:
- Percentage of bus passengers who projected correctly = 41.1%
- Percentage of bus passengers who actually projection correctly = 39.4%
- Percentage of bus passengers who were correct in their projections = \(\frac{39.4}{41.1} \times 100 \approx 95.89\%\)

For the 10th klasy:
- Percentage of bus passengers who projected correctly = 34.4%
- Percentage of bus passengers who actually projected correctly = 33.1%
- Percentage of bus passengers who were correct in their projections = \(\frac{33.1}{34.4} \times 100 \approx 96.26\%\)

For the 11th klasy:
- Percentage of bus passengers who projected correctly = 20.6%
- Percentage of bus passengers who actually projected correctly = 13.8%
- Percentage of bus passengers who were correct in their projections = \(\frac{13.8}{20.6} \times 100 \approx 67.07\%\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangle, we need to analyze the given information and the diagram. The diagram shows a rectangle with two semicircles on its top and bottom, and the total length of the rectangle is 400 meters. The width of the rectangle is the same as the diameter of the semicircles, and the length of the rectangle is the distance between the two semicircles.

Let's denote the width of the rectangle (which is also the diameter of the semicircles) by \( w \) and the length of the rectangle by \( l \). The total length of the rectangle is the sum of the lengths of the two semicircles, which is equal to the width of the rectangle. Therefore, we have:
\[ l + l = 400 \]
\[ 2l = 400 \]
\[ l = 200 \]

The width of the rectangle is the same as the diameter of the semicircles, so:
\[ w = 2r \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the semicircles. The area of the rectangle is given by:
\[ \text{Area} = l \times w = 200 \times 2r = 400r \]

To maximize the area, we need to maximize the radius \( r \). However, the problem does not provide any additional constraints on the radius, so we assume that the radius can be as large as possible while still fitting within the given dimensions of the rectangle. The maximum possible radius is half the width of the rectangle, which is:
\[ r = \frac{w}{2} \]

Since the width \( w \) is the same as the diameter of the semicircles, the maximum possible area of the rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area} = 400 \times \frac{w}{2} = 400 \times \frac{400}{4} = 400 \times 100 = 20000 \]

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by identifying the given information and using trigonometric relationships.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with \(\angle T = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle T\) is the right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle S\) are complementary angles, meaning \(\angle R + \angle S = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\sin{S} = \cos{R}\) and \(\cos{S} = \sin{R}\).

We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}\). In this triangle, the side opposite to \(\angle R\) is 2, and the hypotenuse is 5. We need to find the length of the adjacent side to \(\angle R\), which is also the opposite side to \(\angle S\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{adjacent}^2 + \text{opposite}^2 = \text{hypotenuse}^2

\[

\[

"To find the distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and the point where the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) intersects the x-axis, we first need to determine the x-coordinates of the intersection points. These points occur where \(y = 0\).

Setting \(y = 0\) in the equation of the graph, we get:
\[
0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(\sqrt{2}\) gives:
\[
0 = x^2 - 3
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x^2 = 3 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{3}
\]
So, the points of intersection with the x-axis are \((\sqrt{3}, 0)\) and \((- \sqrt{3}, 0)\).

Next, we calculate the distance from the origin \((0,0)\) to the point \((\sqrt{3}, 0)\). The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting \((x_1, y_1) = (0, 0)\) and \((x_2, y_2) = (\sqrt{3}, 0)\), we get:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the function \( f(x) \) separately.

### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = 3 - x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[
3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
\]
So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
\]
Since \( -3 \leq 3 \), this solution is valid. So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
\]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[
-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
\]
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid in this case.

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
\]
We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
-(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
\]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). We need to check if there are any other real roots, but since the problem is asking for the sum of the values and we have already found valid solutions from the first case, we can conclude that the only valid solutions are from the first case.

### Summing the Solutions
From the first case, we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \) and \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \). Therefore,
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

For the baseball:
\[ F = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 0
\]

Substituting \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\), we get:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + ab = 0
\]

Since \(ab = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), we can substitute \(ab\) in the equation:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + ab = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + ab = 0
\]

Since \(ab = -2a - 2b + ab = 0\), we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2
\]

Thus, the value of \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\) is:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab = 2
\]

Now, we need to find the individual values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). We know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 2
\]

And we also know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = ab = 2
\]

By symmetry and the properties of the roots, we can deduce that the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 2t^2 + 2 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(1 + i\), \(1 - i\), and \(0\). Therefore, the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are \(1 + i\), \(1 - i\), and \(0\).

"To determine the cost of one blyant in cents, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given costs:**
   - One blyant and one jumbo is worth \$1.24.
   - One blyant and one jumbo is worth \$1.82.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   Let \( b \) be the cost of one blyant in dollars.
   Let \( j \) be the cost of one jumbo in dollars.

   From the given information, we have:
   \[
   b + j = 1.24
   \]
   \[
   b + j = 1.82
   \]

3. **Notice the discrepancy:**
   There seems to be a mistake in the problem statement because the same combination of items (one blyant and one jumbo) cannot have two different total costs. Let's assume there was a typo and the correct information should be:
   - One blyant and one jumbo is worth \$1.24.
   - One jumbo and one other item (let's call it item X) is worth \$1.82.

4. **Correct the problem:**
   Let \( x \) be the cost of item X in dollars.

   Now we have:
   \[
   b + j = 1.24
   \]
   \[
   j + x = 1.82
   \]

5. **Solve for \( j \):**
   From the first equation:
   \[
   j = 1.24 - b
   \]

6. **Substitute \( j \) into the second equation:**
   \[
   (1.24 - b) + x = 1.82
   \]

7. **Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   x = 1.82 - 1.24 + b
   \]
   \[
   x = 0.58 + b
   \]

8. **Determine the cost of one blyant:**
   Since we need to find the cost of one blyant in cents, we convert \( b \) from dollars to cents. Let \( b \) be in dollars, then \( b \times 100 \) is the cost in cents.

   From the equation \( x = 0.58 + b \), we see that \( x \) is also in dollars. To find \( b \) in cents, we need to solve for \( b \) in the context of the problem.

9. **Assume the correct interpretation:**
   If we assume the problem meant to find the cost of one blyant in cents, we need to re-evaluate the given information. Let's assume the correct interpretation is that one blyant and one jumbo together cost \$1.24, and one jumbo and one other item together cost \$1.82.

10. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
    Let \( b \) be the cost of one blyant in dollars.
    Let \( j \) be the cost of one jumbo in dollars.
    Let \( x \) be the cost of one other item in dollars.

    We have:
    \[
    b + j = 1.24
    \]
    \[
    j + x = 1.82
    \]

    Solving for \( j \):
    \[
    j = 1.24 - b
    \]

    Substituting \( j \) into the second equation:
    \[
    (1.24 - b) + x = 1.82
    \]
    \[
    x = 1.82 - 1.24 + b
    \]
    \[
    x = 0.58 + b
    \]

    Since \( x \) is the cost of one other item, we need to find \( b \) in cents. Let \( b \) be in dollars, then \( b \times 100 \) is the cost in cents.

    Given the correct interpretation, we find that the cost of one blyant is:
    \[
    b = 0.58 \text{ dollars}
    \]
    \[
    b \times 100 = 58 \text{ cents}
    \]

Therefore, the cost of one blyant in cents is \(\boxed{58}\).","[58, '58']",29,"[29, '29']",False
"To determine the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the fraction if possible**: In this case, the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) is already in its simplest form because 137 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 500 other than 1.

2. **Convert the fraction to a decimal**: To convert \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Alternatively, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by a number that makes the denominator a power of 10. Here, we can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to get:
   \[
   \frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000}
   \]
   Now, \(\frac{274}{1000}\) is a fraction with a denominator of 1000, which means it can be written directly as a decimal:
   \[

"To determine the condition under which the point \( P \) is guaranteed to be inside the rectangle \( ABCD \), we need to analyze the geometric properties and the given ratio \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \).

First, let's place the rectangle \( ABCD \) in the coordinate plane with the center \( O \) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \( A = (-a, a) \), \( B = (a, a) \), \( C = (a, -a) \), and \( D = (-a, -a) \). Here, the length of \( AB \) is \( 2a \) and the length of \( AD \) is also \( 2a \), so \( k = 1 \).

Now, let's consider a point \( P \) inside the rectangle. The coordinates of \( P \) can be written as \( (x, y) \) where \( -a \leq x \leq a \) and \( -a \leq y \leq a \).

The distance from \( P \) to the center \( O \) is given by the Euclidean distance formula:
\[ OP = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]

For \( P \) to be inside the rectangle, the coordinates \( (x, y) \) must satisfy the conditions \( -a \leq x \leq a \) and \( -a \leq y \leq a \). This means that the point \( P \) is inside the rectangle if and only if \( x^2 + y^2 < a^2 \).

Since \( AB = AD \), the rectangle is actually a square. In a square, the center \( O \) is equidistant from all four sides. The distance from the center to any side of the square is \( a \), which is the radius of the circle inscribed in the square. Therefore, any point inside the square is guaranteed to be inside the circle centered at \( O \) with radius \( a \).

Thus, the condition for \( P \) to be inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is that \( P \) must be inside the circle centered at \( O \) with radius \( a \). This is always true for any point inside the square, regardless of the value of \( k \).

Therefore, the condition for \( P \) to be inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is that \( P \) must be inside the circle centered at \( O \) with radius \( a \). This is always true for any point inside the square, regardless of the value of \( k \).

"To solve the problem of finding the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can follow these steps:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
2. Determine the quotient and the remainder.

Let's start with the division:

\[ 54 \div 6 = 9 \]

This division is exact, meaning that 54 is exactly 9 times 6. In other words, there is no remainder. We can express this mathematically as:

\[ 54 = 6 \times 9 + 0 \]

Here, 9 is the quotient and 0 is the remainder. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \frac{\pi}{3} \geq 4 \). Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), we have \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.05 \), which is less than 4.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.05 \rceil = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.7 \), which is greater than 4, we use the first case of the function definition.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.7 \rfloor = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine if \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \), which is equal to 4, we use the first case of the function definition.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and insurance company will pay back to the bank after the interest is added, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they have before interest is added.
2. Determine the interest amount.
3. Add the interest to the total amount to find the final amount to be paid back.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they have before interest is added:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have before interest is added is \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine the interest amount. Since the problem does not specify the interest rate, we will assume a common interest rate for such calculations. Let's assume a 5% interest rate for simplicity. The interest amount is calculated as follows:
\[
126.59 \times 0.05 = 6.33
\]

Now, we add the interest to the total amount to find the final amount to be paid back:
\[
126.59 + 6.33 = 132.92
\]

The final amount to be paid back is \$132.92. To find out how much money they will pay back in cents, we convert \$132.92 to cents:
\[

Therefore, the total amount of money they will pay back to the bank is \(\boxed{13292}\) cents.","[13292, '13292']",59,"[59, '59']",False
"To find the average score of the test, we need to follow these steps:

First, let's calculate the total score. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

So, the total score is calculated as follows:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Now, let's do the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Adding these together gives the total score:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we need to find the average score by dividing the total score by the number of students, which is 30:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals of the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The given grid is:
\[

\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since the sum of each row must be equal, we set this equal to \( S \):
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sum of the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
And the sum of the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 7 - 3 + 7 + 2 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 6 + 1 + 6 = 15

The sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15

The sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 8 + 14 - 9 + 2 = 15

   - The width of the rectangle is 300 meters.
   - The length of the rectangle is 400 meters.

2. **Calculate the length of the diagonal using the Pythagorean theorem:**
   The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
   \[
   d = \sqrt{w^2 + l^2}

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation are \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the shortest distance from point \(D\) to the line segment \(AC\), we need to find the perpendicular distance from point \(D\) to the line passing through points \(A\) and \(C\).

First, let's find the equation of the line passing through points \(A\) and \(C\). The coordinates of \(A\) are \((-3, 3)\) and the coordinates of \(C\) are \((0, -4)\).

The slope \(m\) of the line \(AC\) is given by:
\[
m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1} = \frac{-4 - 3}{0 - (-3)} = \frac{-7}{3}
\]

Using the point-slope form of the line equation \(y - y_1 = m(x - x_1)\), we can write the equation of the line \(AC\) using point \(A(-3, 3)\):
\[
y - 3 = -\frac{7}{3}(x + 3)

Simplifying this, we get:
\[
y - 3 = -\frac{7}{3}x - 7

\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}

First, we rewrite the line equation \(y = -\frac{7}{3}x - 4\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):
\[
\frac{7}{3}x + y + 4 = 0
\]
Multiplying through by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[
7x + 3y + 12 = 0

Now, we identify \(A = 7\), \(B = 3\), and \(C = 12\). The coordinates of point \(D\) are \((0, 5)\). Plugging these values into the distance formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \frac{|7(0) + 3(5) + 12|}{\sqrt{7^2 + 3^2}} = \frac{|0 + 15 + 12|}{\sqrt{49 + 9}} = \frac{|27|}{\sqrt{58}} = \frac{27}{\sqrt{58}}
