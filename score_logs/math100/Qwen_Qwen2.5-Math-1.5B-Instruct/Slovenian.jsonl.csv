"To solve for the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and that \(EF = 7\). Since \( \sin D \) is the ratio of the opposite side to the hypotenuse in a right triangle, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Substituting the known value of \(EF\):
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve the equation for \(DE\):
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) that is the result of rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this to:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = \sqrt{11^2} \times \sqrt{2} = 11 \sqrt{2}.\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

1. Na jarice sest 8 lice.
2. Na jarice sest 3 osebe, sest Pierre, Rosa in Thomas.
3. Na jarice sest skupanog broj lice i osebe, sestim se 2 lice se nespijedno.
4. Na jarice sest skupanog broj lice i osebe, sestim se 1 licu se nespijedno.

Let's break it down:

- Na jarice sest 8 lice.
- Na jarice sest 3 osebe.
- Na jarice sest skupanog broj lice i osebe, sestim se 2 lice se nespijedno.
- Na jarice sest skupanog broj lice i osebe, sestim se 1 licu se nespijedno.

Since the problem states that the total number of lice and osebe is the same as the number of lice plus one more lice, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Number of lice} + \text{Number of osebe} = \text{Number of lice} + 1 \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ 8 + 3 = 8 + 1 \]

This equation is not correct as it stands, but it implies that the total number of lice and osebe is 11 (since 8 lice plus 3 osebe equals 11, and 8 lice plus 1 more lice equals 9, which is not possible with the given information).

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression for \(T_k\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15 - 5 \cdot 3}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{3}\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

Substitute \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) into the expression:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

Now, we need to find the remainder when each of these terms is divided by 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, we have:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Next, we calculate the product \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and then determine the value of \(x + y\) for that vertex.

Given vertices of the parallelogram are \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\). Let's denote these points as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), and \(C(7, 4)\). We need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D(x, y)\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. Therefore, the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, let's find the midpoint of \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Now, let's denote the coordinates of \(D\) as \((x, y)\). The midpoint of \(BD\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\).

Finally, we need to find the value of \(x + y\) for the vertex \(D\):
\[
x + y = 6 + (-1) = 5

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"To find \(\tan A\) for the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can follow these steps:

1. Recall the definition of \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\) in a right triangle. For \(\angle A\), \(\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\) and \(\cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).

2. Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can express this relationship in terms of the sides of the triangle. Let the side opposite to \(\angle A\) be \(a\), the side adjacent to \(\angle A\) be \(b\), and the hypotenuse be \(c\). Then, \(\sin A = \frac{a}{c}\) and \(\cos A = \frac{b}{c}\). Substituting these into the given equation, we get:
   \[
   \frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}

3. Now, we need to find \(\tan A\). Recall that \(\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}\). Using the expressions for \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\), we have:
   \[
   \tan A = \frac{\frac{a}{c}}{\frac{b}{c}} = \frac{a}{b}
   \]
   Since we know \(a = 2b\), we substitute this into the equation:

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]

This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 7 \]
\[ x + 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -2 \]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to analyze the behavior of \( f(x) \) as \( x \) approaches infinity. We do this by comparing the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have found that \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these together, we get:
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in a straightforward manner, we can use the algebraic identity for the sum of a number and its square plus one. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten using the identity for the square of a binomial.

The identity we will use is:
\[ (a-1)^2 + (a-1) + 1 = a^2 \]

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0
\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}
\]
The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \):
\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}
\]

Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is:

C = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}
\]

To show that for any vector \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) is the largest possible value of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) when \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) is the operator norm of \(\mathbf{a}\), we note that the operator norm of a vector \(\mathbf{a}\) is defined as the maximum value of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) over all unit vectors \(\mathbf{v}\). Since \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) is the maximum value of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) when \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) is the operator norm of \(\mathbf{a}\), it follows that \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) is the largest possible value of \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) when \(\|\mathbf{a}\|\) is the operator norm of \(\mathbf{a}\).

Since \(z \neq 1\), we exclude \(k = 0\), leaving us with the roots \(z = e^{2\pi i / 5}\), \(z = e^{4\pi i / 5}\), \(z = e^{6\pi i / 5}\), and \(z = e^{8\pi i / 5}\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\) and \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\). Therefore, the expression can be rewritten as:
\[z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.\]

Next, we use the fact that the sum of all fifth roots of unity is zero. That is, \(1 + z + z^2 + z^3 + z^4 = 0\). Excluding the root \(z = 1\), we have:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:

\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare coefficients.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately:

\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 2 to solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in equations 3 and 4:

For equation 3:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

Both equations are satisfied, so our values are correct. Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

\[ C = 2\pi r \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base. We can set up the equation:

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects the line \(y = 2a\) exactly once, we need to analyze the function piece by piece.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find the value of \(a\) such that the line \(y = 2a\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) exactly once. This means that the equation \(f(x) = 2a\) must have exactly one solution.

First, consider the case when \(x \geq a\). Here, the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). Setting \(f(x) = 2a\), we get:
\[ ax^2 = 2a. \]
If \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[ x^2 = 2. \]
This gives us two solutions:
\[ x = \sqrt{2} \quad \text{or} \quad x = -\sqrt{2}. \]
However, since we are considering the case \(x \geq a\), we need \(a \leq \sqrt{2}\) and \(a \leq -\sqrt{2}\). But since \(a\) is a real number and we are looking for a single intersection, we need to check the other case as well.

Next, consider the case when \(x < a\). Here, the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). Setting \(f(x) = 2a\), we get:
\[ ax + 2a = 2a. \]
Subtracting \(2a\) from both sides, we get:
\[ ax = 0. \]
If \(a \neq 0\), then \(x = 0\). Since \(x < a\), we need \(a > 0\) and \(0 < a\), which is always true for \(a > 0\).

Now, we need to ensure that the function does not intersect the line \(y = 2a\) at any other point. The function \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) is a parabola opening upwards, and the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) is a straight line with a positive slope. For the line \(y = 2a\) to intersect the graph of \(f(x)\) exactly once, the parabola and the line must not intersect for \(x \geq a\) or the line must not intersect the parabola for \(x < a\) at any point other than \(x = 0\).

From the analysis, we see that if \(a = 0\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), and the line \(y = 0\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) at every point, not just once. Therefore, \(a = 0\) is not a valid solution.

If \(a > 0\), the line \(y = 2a\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) at \(x = 0\) and does not intersect the parabola \(y = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) because \(ax^2 < 2a\) for \(x < \sqrt{2}\) and \(x \geq a\). Therefore, the line \(y = 2a\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) exactly once.

Thus, the smallest positive value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

We are given that the radius is 1, so:
\[ 1^2 = 34 - c \]
\[ 1 = 34 - c \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality simplifies to:
\[
0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies 1 \leq \lambda \leq 2.
\]
So, for \(\lambda\) in the interval \([1,2]\), \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f\). For \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,1)\), the only fixed point is \(x = 0\).

Next, we need to check if there are any values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which is true. If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have solutions other than the fixed points, the cubic equation must have roots in the interval \((0,1)\). The only way this can happen is if the cubic equation has a root in \((0,1)\) that is not a fixed point of \(f\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we see that for \(\lambda \in [0,4]\), the function \(f(x)\) is a parabola that opens downwards and has a maximum value of \(\frac{\lambda}{4}\) at \(x = \frac{\lambda}{2}\). For \(\lambda \in [1,2]\), the function \(f(x)\) has two fixed points, one of which is \(x = 0\) and the other is \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(\lambda \in [2,4]\), the function \(f(x)\) has no fixed points in \((0,1)\) other than \(x = 0\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) and \(f(f(x)) = x\) are \(\lambda \in [1,2]\).

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]

Applying these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator as follows:

Numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 5^\circ\) as \(\cos 85^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

"To determine how many trailing zeros are in the factorial of 42, we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

For \(42!\) and the prime number 5, we calculate:

\[

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) and the terms \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are defined only when \( -1 \le y \le 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \), respectively.

To find the maximum value, we can consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). Let's evaluate \( f(x, y) \) at the points where \( x \) and \( y \) are either \( 1 \) or \( -1 \).

1. If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \):
   \[
   f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.

   \[
   f(-1, 1) = (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = (-1) \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.

4. If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \):
   \[
   f(-1, -1) = (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = (-1) \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.

Next, we consider the case where \( x = y \). If \( x = y \), then:
\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we can take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
2(1 - 2x^2) = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.

\[

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

So, the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Since \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( \alpha^2 = \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore,

\[ \alpha^2 - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5}}{2} - 4 = \frac{3 + \sqrt{5} - 8}{2} = \frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

However, we can simplify our approach by recognizing that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are complex conjugates on the unit circle in the complex plane, and thus \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) or \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{5} \). This is because the golden ratio is related to the angle \( \frac{\pi}{5} \) in the complex plane.

Given \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = \left( e^{i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1 \). Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then \( z^{85} = \left( e^{-i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1 \).

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 \), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + (-1) = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle \(ABC\) and the triangle \(WU\) formed by the intersection of the medians and the line segment \(BC\).

1. **Identify the centroid \(G\):**
   The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Properties of the centroid:**
   The centroid \(G\) also divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, each of these smaller triangles has an area of \(\frac{144}{6} = 24\).

3. **Triangle \(WU\):**
   The triangle \(WU\) is formed by the intersection of the medians and the line segment \(BC\). The centroid \(G\) divides the triangle \(ABC\) into six smaller triangles of equal area, and the line segment \(BC\) intersects the medians at points \(M\) and \(N\) such that \(G\) is the centroid of triangle \(ABC\).

4. **Area of triangle \(WU\):**
   The triangle \(WU\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) and is formed by the intersection of the medians and the line segment \(BC\). The area of triangle \(WU\) is \(\frac{1}{6}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). This is because the centroid divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area, and triangle \(WU\) is one of these smaller triangles.

Therefore, the area of triangle \(WU\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle WU = \frac{1}{6} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{6} \times 144 = 24

"To determine which of the three polities has the most math books, we need to analyze the information given:

1. The total number of books is 24.
2. The first polity has 8 math books.
3. The second polity has 10 math books.
4. The third polity has 6 math books.

We can see that the second polity has the most math books with 10 books.

Next, we need to determine which of the three polities has the most total books. We know the total number of books is 24, and we need to distribute these books among the three polities. Since the total is 24 and the second polity has 10 math books, the remaining books are 14 (24 - 10 = 14). These 14 books are distributed among the first and third polities. Since the first polity has 8 math books, the remaining books in the first polity are 2 (14 - 8 = 6). Therefore, the first polity has 8 + 2 = 10 books in total. The third polity has 6 books in total.

Now, we need to determine which of the three polities has the most total books. We have already calculated that the first polity has 10 books, the second polity has 10 books, and the third polity has 6 books. Therefore, the first and second polities have the most total books, with 10 books each.

Since the problem asks for the number of books that are both in the first and second polities, we need to determine the overlap between the first and second polities. However, the problem does not provide information about the overlap, so we cannot determine the exact number of books that are in both polities. But based on the information given, we can conclude that the polities with the most books are the first and second polities, each with 10 books.

"To determine the value of the sixth term in the arithmetic sequence, we need to use the properties of arithmetic sequences. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between consecutive terms is constant. This difference is called the common difference, denoted as \(d\).

Given:
- The first term \(a_1 = 200\)
- The eighth term \(a_8 = 500\)

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

For the eighth term (\(n = 8\)):
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d\]

"To determine how many numbers are divisible by both 100 and 150, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. A number that is divisible by both 100 and 150 must be a multiple of their LCM.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[ \text{LCM}(100, 150) = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2 = 4 \times 3 \times 25 = 300 \]

So, we need to find how many multiples of 300 are there between 1 and 1000. We do this by dividing 1000 by 300 and taking the integer part of the quotient:

"To determine the smallest integer \( n > 1 \) such that \( n^2 \) divides \( 2^{24} \), we need to analyze the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \) and \( n^2 \).

First, note that the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \) is simply \( 2^{24} \). For \( n^2 \) to divide \( 2^{24} \), \( n \) itself must be a power of 2. Let \( n = 2^k \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( n^2 = (2^k)^2 = 2^{2k} \). We need \( 2^{2k} \) to divide \( 2^{24} \), which means \( 2k \leq 24 \). Solving for \( k \), we get \( k \leq 12 \).

The smallest integer \( k \) greater than 0 is 1. Therefore, the smallest \( n \) is \( 2^1 = 2 \).

To verify, if \( n = 2 \), then \( n^2 = 2^2 = 4 \), and \( 4 \) divides \( 2^{24} \) because \( 2^{24} = 16777216 \) and \( 16777216 \div 4 = 4194304 \), which is an integer.

According to the problem, after giving away 19 stamps, Paul still has \( x \) stamps. This can be expressed by the equation:
\[ x - 19 = x \]

However, this equation is not correct because it implies that giving away 19 stamps changes the number of stamps Paul has, which is not possible. Instead, the problem is saying that the number of stamps Paul has left after giving away 19 stamps is the same as the number of stamps he originally had, which means he must have had 19 stamps to begin with. This is because if he had 19 stamps, giving away 19 stamps would leave him with 0 stamps, but the problem states that he still has the same number of stamps he originally had, which is 19.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total surface area of the oblique triangular prism. Let's break it down step by step.

   The triangular base is a right triangle with legs of lengths 2 and 4. The area \(A\) of a right triangle is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4

   So, the area of the triangular base is 4 square units.

2. **Determine the height of the prism:**
   The height of the prism is the perpendicular distance between the two triangular bases. From the diagram, we can see that the height of the prism is 3 units.

3. **Calculate the surface area of the prism:**
   The surface area of a prism consists of the areas of the two triangular bases and the areas of the three rectangular faces. The area of the two triangular bases is:
   \[
   2 \times 4 = 8

   The areas of the three rectangular faces are:

   - The area of the rectangle with dimensions 4 (height of the triangle) and 3 (height of the prism) is:

   - The area of the rectangle with dimensions \(\sqrt{2^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{4 + 16} = \sqrt{20} = 2\sqrt{5}\) (hypotenuse of the triangle) and 3 (height of the prism) is:

2. **Understand the requirement for the number to have all digits as 5:**
   A number with all digits as 5 can be written in the form \(555\ldots555\). Let's denote this number by \(N\). For \(N\) to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by \(2\), \(3^2\), and \(5^2\).

3. **Check divisibility by 2:**
   A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Since \(N\) consists only of the digit 5, it is not divisible by 2. Therefore, \(N\) cannot be a multiple of 450 because 450 is divisible by 2.

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\).

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines and cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

"To find the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x + 5) = 0 \). This means that \( x + 5 \) must be a root of \( f(x) \).

Let's denote the roots of \( f(x) \) by \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

First, we need to find the roots of \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \). We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that any rational root of the polynomial \( f(x) \) is a factor of the constant term (here, \(-2015\)) divided by a factor of the leading coefficient (here, \(1\)). Therefore, the possible rational roots are the factors of \(-2015\), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 5, \pm 13, \pm 31, \pm 65, \pm 155, \pm 403, \pm 2015 \).

Let's test these possible roots. We start with \( x = 13 \):

\[
f(13) = 13^3 - 49 \cdot 13^2 + 623 \cdot 13 - 2015 = 2197 - 8281 + 8099 - 2015 = 0
\]

So, \( x = 13 \) is a root of \( f(x) \). We can now factor \( f(x) \) as \( f(x) = (x - 13)(x^2 - 36x + 155) \). To verify this, we can use polynomial division or synthetic division to divide \( f(x) \) by \( x - 13 \).

Using synthetic division:

\[
\begin{array}{r|rrrr}
13 & 1 & -49 & 623 & -2015 \\
   &   & 13 & -468 & 155 \\
\hline
   & 1 & -36 & 155 & 0 \\
\end{array}
\]

The quotient is \( x^2 - 36x + 155 \), so we have:

\[
f(x) = (x - 13)(x^2 - 36x + 155)
\]

Next, we need to find the roots of the quadratic \( x^2 - 36x + 155 \). We can use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -36 \), and \( c = 155 \):

\[
x = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{(-36)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 155}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{1296 - 620}}{2} = \frac{36 \pm \sqrt{676}}{2} = \frac{36 \pm 26}{2}
\]

This gives us two roots:

\[
x = \frac{36 + 26}{2} = 31 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{36 - 26}{2} = 5
\]

So, the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( 13, 31, \) and \( 5 \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \) are \( 13 - 5 = 8 \), \( 31 - 5 = 26 \), and \( 5 - 5 = 0 \).

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This gives us:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

To find this sum, we use the known result from trigonometric identities that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 8\). This result can be derived using more advanced trigonometric identities or by using known values and properties of the tangent and cotangent functions.

Thus, we have:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 8 = 11.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon whose sum of interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2)^\circ
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side of the equation:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

Adding 2 to both sides gives:

"To solve the problem, we need to find an integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \).

Let's start by expanding and simplifying the congruence:
\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By checking the squares of the integers from 1 to 22, we find that:
\[ 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -18 \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]

We need to check which of these solutions satisfy the original condition \( 0 < t < 23 \). Both 17 and 4 are in the range \( 0 < t < 23 \), so both are valid solutions. However, we need to verify that they satisfy the original condition \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
We need to check if 19 is the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23. This means we need to check if \( 17 \cdot 19 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, 19 is indeed the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23.

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
We need to check if 6 is the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23. This means we need to check if \( 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, 6 is indeed the modular inverse of 4 modulo 23.

Therefore, the solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since the problem does not specify which solution to choose, we can provide either one. For the sake of completeness, we will provide both solutions.

"To determine the total number of coins in the bag, we need to know the number of coins in each type of container and the number of each type of container. However, the problem does not provide the number of each type of container. Let's assume the problem is asking for the total number of coins if we had one of each type of container (a quadrilateral container and a cube container).

1. Identify the number of coins in each type of container:
   - A quadrilateral container (which we can assume contains a certain number of coins, but since the problem doesn't specify, we'll use a variable for now).
   - A cube container with a volume of 1 k cube (which we can assume contains a certain number of coins, but since the problem doesn't specify, we'll use a variable for now).

2. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact number of coins in each container, we can't calculate a specific numerical answer. However, if we assume the problem is asking for the total number of coins if we had one of each type of container, we can use the information given about the cube container to infer the number of coins in the quadrilateral container.

3. The problem states that the cube container has a volume of 1 k cube, which we can assume contains 1 coin (since the problem doesn't specify otherwise).

4. Therefore, if we have one cube container, it contains 1 coin.

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

"To determine how many points have integer coordinates within the interior of the given right-angled triangle, we first need to identify the vertices of the triangle and then count the integer coordinate points that lie strictly inside the triangle.

The vertices of the right-angled triangle are given as \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\). This triangle is symmetric about both the x-axis and the y-axis, and its legs are along the lines \(x = 5\), \(x = -5\), \(y = 4\), and \(y = -4\).

The interior of the triangle is the region where \(x\) ranges from \(-5\) to \(5\) (excluding \(-5\) and \(5\)) and \(y\) ranges from \(-4\) to \(4\) (excluding \(-4\) and \(4\)). Therefore, the integer coordinates for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\) and for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\).

7. **Substitute the areas into the total area equation:**
   \[
   42 = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h

   Factor out \( \frac{1}{2} \times h \):
   \[

   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[

8. **Solve for \( h \):**
   Since \( h \) is the height of both triangles, we can express \( h \) in terms of the area of \( \triangle ACD \):
   \[
   h = \frac{2 \times [ACD]}{a}

   Substitute \( h \) back into the equation:
   \[

   Simplify:
   \[
   84 = 2 \times [ACD] \times \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
   Since \( \frac{b}{a} = \frac{AD}{BC} \), we can use the fact that the total area is 42:
   \[
   84 = 2 \times [ACD] \times \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
   Simplify further:
   \[
   84 = 2 \times [ACD] \times \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]
   Since \( \frac{b}{a} = \frac{AD}{BC} \), we can use the fact that the total area is 42:
   \[
   84 = 2 \times [ACD] \times \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)
   \]

9. **Final calculation:**
   Since \( \frac{b}{a} = \frac{AD}{BC} \), we can use the fact that the total area is 42:
   \[
   84 = 2 \times [ACD] \times \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:

   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:

First, identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\):

Given that \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are collinear on line \(D\), and that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are perpendicular, we can infer that \(D\) must be a point such that the line segment \(CD\) is perpendicular to the line \(AB\).

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) in the given geometric configuration. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - We have a square \(ABCD\) with side length 2.
   - There is a circle with center \(D\) and radius 1.
   - The area of the sector of the circle is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the square.

2. **Calculate the area of the square:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the square} = 2 \times 2 = 4

3. **Calculate the area of the sector of the circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4 = \frac{20}{12} = \frac{5}{3}

4. **Determine the central angle of the sector:**
   The area of a sector of a circle is given by:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2
   \]
   where \( \theta \) is the central angle in degrees and \( r \) is the radius of the circle. Here, \( r = 1 \) and the area of the sector is \(\frac{5}{3}\). So, we have:

"To determine how many varfes of water are needed to fill a sphere with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylinder and the sphere and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. Here, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Here, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Plugging in this value, we get:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.

Next, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 10 people, where each member of the committee must be from a different stratum, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of strata and the number of members in each stratum. In this problem, there are 5 strata, and each stratum has exactly one member in the committee.

2. Since each member of the committee must come from a different stratum, we are essentially choosing one member from each of the 5 strata. If we assume there are enough members in each stratum to choose from, the number of ways to choose one member from each stratum is the product of the number of choices for each stratum.

3. If we assume there are at least 5 members in each stratum (since the problem states ""iz vsake"" which implies there are enough members), then the number of ways to choose one member from each of the 5 strata is simply the product of the number of choices for each stratum. Since the problem does not specify the exact number of members in each stratum, we can assume there are at least 5 members in each stratum, and thus the number of ways to choose one member from each stratum is \(1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1\) for each stratum.

4. Therefore, the total number of ways to form the committee is the product of the number of choices for each stratum, which is \(1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1\) for each stratum, but since we are choosing one member from each of the 5 strata, the total number of ways is simply the product of the number of choices for each stratum, which is \(1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 \times 1 = 1\) for each stratum.

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(AM\) is the altitude and the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\), we have \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\). Now, consider triangle \(BDC\). Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BAC = \theta\), we can use the fact that \(\angle BDC\) is an external angle to triangle \(ABD\) at \(D\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = \angle BAD + \angle ABD\). However, since \(\angle BAD = \frac{\theta}{2}\) and \(\angle ABD = \angle ACD\) (because \(AB = AC\) and \(M\) is the midpoint), we need to find \(\angle ACD\).

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BDC = \angle BAD + \angle ABD\), we have:
\[
3\theta = \frac{\theta}{2} + \angle ABD

\[

Since \(\angle ABD = \angle ACD\), we can use the fact that \(\angle ABD = \angle ACD = \frac{3\theta - \frac{\theta}{2}}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{4}\).

Now, we use the Law of Sines in triangle \(BDC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{BD}{\sin(\angle BCD)} = \frac{CD}{\sin(\angle CBD)}
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(AB = AC\) and \(M\) is the midpoint), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{BD}{\sin(\angle BCD)}

Since \(\angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{BD}{\sin\left(\frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\right)}

\frac{BC}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{\frac{BC}{2}}{\cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right)}
\]
\[
\frac{1}{\sin(3\theta)} = \frac{1}{2\cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right)}
\]
\[
2\cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \sin(3\theta)
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin(3\theta) = 3\sin(\theta) - 4\sin^3(\theta)\), and the double angle identity for cosine, \(\cos\left(\frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = 4\cos^3\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 3\cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\), we can solve for \(\theta\).

After solving, we find that \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BAC = 30^\circ\) and \(\angle BDC = 90^\circ\). This means that triangle \(BDC\) is a right triangle with \(\angle BDC = 90^\circ\), \(\angle BCD = 60^\circ\), and \(\angle CBD = 30^\circ\).

Since \(BD = CD\) and \(BD = \frac{BC}{2}\), we have:
\[
BC = 2BD = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]
Since \(AB = AC\) and \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we have:
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + 5^2} = \sqrt{121 + 25} = \sqrt{146}

"To determine the median of the number of problems solved by 27 students, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of students**: There are 27 students.
2. **Determine the position of the median**: Since there is an odd number of students, the median will be the value at the \(\left(\frac{27 + 1}{2}\right)\)-th position, which is the 14th position.

The problem states that the total number of problems solved by all students is \(3^7\). However, this information is not necessary to find the median, as the median is simply the value at the 14th position when the data is ordered.

Since the problem does not provide the specific number of problems solved by each student, we can assume that the data is already ordered or that the distribution of the problems solved is such that the 14th student has the median number of problems solved. Without loss of generality, we can conclude that the median is the number of problems solved by the 14th student in the ordered list.

Given that the problem does not provide the specific distribution of the problems solved, we can only conclude that the median is the number of problems solved by the 14th student. However, since the problem asks for the median and does not provide the specific distribution, we can infer that the median is the middle value of the ordered list, which is the 14th value.

Therefore, the median number of problems solved is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",81,"[81, '81']",False
"1. **Define the function and its domain:**
   Let \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \). The domain of \( f(x) \) is all real numbers, i.e., \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

2. **Analyze the function:**
   Notice that \( f(x) \) is an even function because \( f(-x) = (-x)^4 + 4(-x)^2 = x^4 + 4x^2 = f(x) \). Therefore, it is sufficient to analyze \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq 0 \).

3. **Find the minimum value of \( f(x) \):**
   To find the minimum value, we take the derivative of \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^4 + 4x^2) = 4x^3 + 8x = 4x(x^2 + 2)
   \]
   Set the derivative equal to zero to find critical points:
   \[
   4x(x^2 + 2) = 0
   \]
   This gives \( x = 0 \) (since \( x^2 + 2 \) is always positive).

4. **Determine the nature of the critical point:**
   Evaluate the second derivative to determine if it is a minimum:
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(4x^3 + 8x) = 12x^2 + 8
   \]
   At \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   f''(0) = 12(0)^2 + 8 = 8 > 0
   \]
   Since \( f''(0) > 0 \), \( x = 0 \) is a local minimum.

5. **Calculate the minimum value:**
   \[
   f(0) = 0^4 + 4(0)^2 = 0
   \]
   Therefore, the minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 0.

6. **Determine the range of \( f(x) \):**
   Since \( f(x) \) is an even function and has a minimum value of 0, for \( x \geq 0 \), \( f(x) \geq 0 \). As \( x \to \infty \), \( f(x) \to \infty \). Thus, the range of \( f(x) \) for \( x \geq 0 \) is \( [0, \infty) \).

7. **Consider the given inequality:**
   We need to solve the inequality:
   \[
   -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]
   Since \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \), the left part of the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 \) is always true for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).

8. **Solve the right part of the inequality:**
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]
   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]
   Rearrange to form a quadratic inequality:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]
   Solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]
   This gives the roots:
   \[
   y = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = -7
   \]
   Since \( y = x^2 \geq 0 \), we only consider \( y = 3 \). The quadratic inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) holds for:
   \[
   0 \leq y < 3
   \]
   Therefore:
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3

"To solve for \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations:
\[

\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we will use algebraic identities and substitutions.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
4 - 12 = -8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p).
\]
We also know that:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx) = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Next, we use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
We can factor this expression using the identity:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the known values \(x+y+z = s\), \(xy + yz + zx = p\), and \(xyz = 4\), we get:
\[
12 = s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Solving for \(sp\), we have:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we have:
\[
s^3 = 64 \implies s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To determine which ratio red is the one where the number of up Skipne is exactly 135% of the number of peredne, we need to calculate the number of up Skipne for each ratio red and compare it to 135% of the number of peredne.

Let's denote the total number of up Skipne in the table as \( U \) and the total number of peredne as \( P \). We need to find the ratio red where the number of up Skipne is \( 1.35 \times \) the number of peredne.

First, let's calculate the total number of up Skipne and peredne:

\[
U = 300 + 300 = 600
\]
\[
P = 300 + 300 = 600
\]

Now, we need to find the ratio red where the number of up Skipne is \( 1.35 \times 300 = 405 \) for the \( 10^{\text{th}} \) ratio red.

Let's check the \( 10^{\text{th}} \) ratio red:

\[
\text{Number of up Skipne} = 34.4\% \times 600 = 0.344 \times 600 = 206.4
\]
\[
\text{Number of peredne} = 33.1\% \times 600 = 0.331 \times 600 = 198.6
\]

Since 206.4 is not equal to 405, the \( 10^{\text{th}} \) ratio red is not the correct one.

Now, let's check the \( 12^{\text{th}} \) ratio red:

\[
\text{Number of up Skipne} = 11.6\% \times 600 = 0.116 \times 600 = 69.6
\]
\[
\text{Number of peredne} = 8.6\% \times 600 = 0.086 \times 600 = 51.6
\]

Since 69.6 is not equal to 405, the \( 12^{\text{th}} \) ratio red is not the correct one.

Now, let's check the \( 9^{\text{th}} \) ratio red:

\[
\text{Number of up Skipne} = 41.1\% \times 600 = 0.411 \times 600 = 246.6
\]
\[
\text{Number of peredne} = 39.4\% \times 600 = 0.394 \times 600 = 236.4
\]

Since 246.6 is not equal to 405, the \( 9^{\text{th}} \) ratio red is not the correct one.

Finally, let's check the \( 11^{\text{th}} \) ratio red:

\[
\text{Number of up Skipne} = 20.6\% \times 600 = 0.206 \times 600 = 123.6
\]
\[
\text{Number of peredne} = 13.8\% \times 600 = 0.138 \times 600 = 82.8
\]

Since 123.6 is not equal to 405, the \( 11^{\text{th}} \) ratio red is not the correct one.

It seems there was a miscalculation in the problem statement or the reference solution. Let's recheck the problem statement and the reference solution to ensure the correct interpretation.

The correct interpretation should be that the number of up Skipne is exactly 135% of the number of peredne for the \( 10^{\text{th}} \) ratio red, which is not possible with the given data. Therefore, the correct answer should be re-evaluated with the correct data.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

"To solve for \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by identifying the given information and using trigonometric relationships.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\).

In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Therefore, for \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite to } R}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
This means that if we let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\), then the hypotenuse \(RS = 5k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side \(RT\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 - ST^2 = (5k)^2 - (2k)^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2 = 21k^2

\[
RT = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}

The distance \(d\) from a point \((x, y)\) to the origin is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}

Substitute \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}

Simplify the expression inside the square root:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):
\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9

Substitute this back into the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}

Distribute \(\frac{1}{2}\):
\[

\]

Combine like terms:
\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}

To minimize \(d\), we minimize \(d^2\):
\[
d^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). To find the critical points, take the derivative of \(f(x)\) and set it to zero:
\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]
\[

\]

Solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm\sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluate \(f(x)\) at these critical points:
\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \(d\) is:

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):

   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0

   We can factor out \( x \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0

   The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this range. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( f(x) = 0 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6

   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Let's test \( x = 4 \):

   -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6

   Let's test \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   -5^3 + 2 \cdot 5^2 + 3 \cdot 5 = -125 + 50 + 15 = -60 \neq 6
   \]
   Since the function is continuous and changes from negative to positive as \( x \) increases from 3 to 5, there must be a root between 3 and 5. However, without further numerical methods, we can't determine the exact value. But for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that there is no simple integer solution and the problem might be designed to have a simpler answer.

Given the problem's context, we can assume that the solution for \( f^{-1}(6) \) is not easily found without numerical methods, but the problem might be designed to have a simpler answer. Since the problem asks for \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) and we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \), we can assume that the problem is designed such that \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \) is the only feasible solution in the context of the problem.

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8
To convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8, we repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

### Step 3: Add the two base 7 and base 8 numbers
Now we need to add \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\). First, we convert both numbers to base 10.

For \(1556_7\):
\[
1556_7 = 1 \cdot 7^3 + 5 \cdot 7^2 + 5 \cdot 7^1 + 6 \cdot 7^0 = 1 \cdot 343 + 5 \cdot 49 + 5 \cdot 7 + 6 \cdot 1 = 343 + 245 + 35 + 6 = 629_{10}
\]

For \(1165_8\):
\[
1165_8 = 1 \cdot 8^3 + 1 \cdot 8^2 + 6 \cdot 8^1 + 5 \cdot 8^0 = 1 \cdot 512 + 1 \cdot 64 + 6 \cdot 8 + 5 \cdot 1 = 512 + 64 + 48 + 5 = 629_{10}
\]

Now we add the two base 10 numbers:
\[
629 + 629 = 1258
\]

### Step 4: Convert the sum back to base 10
The sum is already in base 10, so we don't need to convert it further.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1258}

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), where \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) and \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we can use a useful property of polynomials.

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \), which is the same as \( f(0) \) because \( g(x) = f(x-1) \).

Let's calculate \( f(0) \):

\[

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form of the line is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) which are the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We will then use these roots to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, let's find the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We can use the fact that the polynomial can be factored into two quadratic polynomials. By trial and error or using a root-finding algorithm, we find that the polynomial can be factored as:
\[x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = (x^2 + x + \sqrt{2})(x^2 + x - \sqrt{2}).\]

Now, we solve each quadratic equation separately.

For the first quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + \sqrt{2} = 0\), we use the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{2}}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}.\]
So, the roots are:
\[x_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}, \quad x_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}.\]

For the second quadratic equation \(x^2 + x - \sqrt{2} = 0\), we again use the quadratic formula:
\[x = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-\sqrt{2})}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-1 \pm \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}.\]
So, the roots are:
\[x_3 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}, \quad x_4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}.\]

Now, we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). We can use the fact that the sum of the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) is \(-2\) (from Vieta's formulas), and the product of the roots taken two at a time is 0 (also from Vieta's formulas).

Let's denote the roots as \(\alpha_1 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}\), \(\alpha_2 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 - 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}\), \(\alpha_3 = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}\), and \(\alpha_4 = \frac{-1 - \sqrt{1 + 4\sqrt{2}}}{2}\).

We can calculate the expressions as follows:
1. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\):

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) by performing the long division.

Let's do the long division step by step:

- 500 goes into 1370 (we add a decimal point and a zero to 137, making it 1370) 2 times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). So, we write 2 after the decimal point.
- Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 3700.
- 500 goes into 3700 7 times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). So, we write 7 after the 2.
- Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 2000.
- 500 goes into 2000 4 times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). So, we write 4 after the 7.
- Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is also on the line segment \(OC\), where \(O\) is the intersection of the diagonals of the rectangle and \(C\) is one of the vertices of the rectangle.

First, let's establish the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle \(ABCD\). Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The diagonals of the rectangle intersect at the midpoint of the diagonals, which is the origin \(O = (0, 0)\).

The line segment \(OC\) is a line passing through the origin \(O\) and the point \(C = (a, -b)\). The equation of the line \(OC\) can be derived as follows:
The slope of the line \(OC\) is \(\frac{-b - 0}{a - 0} = -\frac{b}{a}\). Therefore, the equation of the line \(OC\) is:
\[ y = -\frac{b}{a}x. \]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[ \text{Area of } ABCD = 2a \times 2b = 4ab. \]

The line \(OC\) divides the rectangle into two regions of equal area because it passes through the center of the rectangle. Therefore, the area of the region on one side of the line \(OC\) is half the area of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Area of the region on one side of } OC = \frac{4ab}{2} = 2ab. \]

Since the line \(OC\) divides the rectangle into two equal areas, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is also on the line segment \(OC\) is the ratio of the length of the line segment \(OC\) to the area of the rectangle. However, since the line segment \(OC\) has no area (it is a one-dimensional object in a two-dimensional space), the probability is effectively zero.

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is also on the line segment \(OC\) is:

\lceil n \rceil & \text{Ne } n < 4.

\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.0472 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The final answer is:

"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total, we need to add their individual amounts together. The amounts are as follows:

- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

First, we add the amounts step by step:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]

\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.59. Since they need to pay a fee in dollars and the fee is equal to the total amount in dollars, they need to pay \$126.59. The remaining amount in the bank will be the total amount minus the fee:

\[
126.59 - 126.59 = 0
\]

However, the problem asks for the amount of money they have in cents after paying the fee. Since they have exactly \$126.59 and they need to pay \$126.59, they have no money left in the bank in cents. Therefore, the amount of money they have in cents after paying the fee is:

\[
0 \text{ cents}
\]

So, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{0}

"To find the arithmetic mean of the grades of Razred, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of students.
2. Calculate the total sum of all the grades.
3. Divide the total sum of the grades by the total number of students to find the arithmetic mean.

First, let's determine the total number of students. According to the problem, Razred has 30 students in total.

Next, we calculate the total sum of all the grades. We know that:
- 20 students got 80,
- 8 students got 90,
- 2 students got 100,
- and the remaining students got grades that we don't know but we don't need to calculate them because we are only given the grades for 24 students (30 - 6 = 24).

So, the total sum of the grades is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Let's calculate each term separately:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these values together to get the total sum of the grades:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Finally, we divide the total sum of the grades by the total number of students to find the arithmetic mean:
\[ \text{Arithmetic mean} = \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the arithmetic mean of the grades of Razred is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a square matrix and the properties of its diagonals. Specifically, we need to determine the number of elements in the main diagonal, the anti-diagonal, and the diagonals that are two steps away from the main diagonal for a square matrix of size \( n \times n \).

1. **Main Diagonal**: The main diagonal of an \( n \times n \) matrix consists of the elements \( (1,1), (2,2), \ldots, (n,n) \). Therefore, there are \( n \) elements in the main diagonal.

2. **anti-Diagonal**: The anti-diagonal of an \( n \times n \) matrix consists of the elements \( (1,n), (2,n-1), \ldots, (n,1) \). Therefore, there are \( n \) elements in the anti-diagonal.

3. **Diagonals Two Steps Away from the Main Diagonal**: For an \( n \times n \) matrix, the diagonals that are two steps away from the main diagonal are the diagonals that start from the elements \( (1,3), (2,4), \ldots, (n-2,n) \) and end at the elements \( (3,1), (4,2), \ldots, (n,3) \). The number of elements in each of these diagonals is \( n-2 \). Since there are two such diagonals, the total number of elements in these diagonals is \( 2(n-2) \).

Adding these together, the total number of elements in the main diagonal, the anti-diagonal, and the diagonals that are two steps away from the main diagonal is:
\[ n + n + 2(n-2) = 2n + 2(n-2) = 2n + 2n - 4 = 4n - 4. \]

However, we need to consider that the problem states that the total number of elements in these diagonals is \( 2n-9 \). This suggests that the matrix is not a full \( n \times n \) matrix but rather a matrix with some elements missing. The only way this can happen is if the matrix is not a full square matrix but rather a matrix with some elements missing, and the only way to get the given number of elements is if the matrix is a \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix. For a \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix, the number of elements in the main diagonal, the anti-diagonal, and the diagonals that are two steps away from the main diagonal is:
\[ 3 + 3 + 2(3-2) = 3 + 3 + 2 = 8. \]
But the problem states that the total number of elements is \( 2n-9 \), and for \( n = 3 \), we have:
\[ 2(3) - 9 = 6 - 9 = -3, \]
which is not possible. Therefore, the only way to satisfy the given condition is if the matrix is not a full square matrix but rather a matrix with some elements missing, and the only way to get the given number of elements is if the matrix is a \( 3 \times 3 \) matrix. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:
\[ \boxed{3}. \]","[3, '3']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine how many more steps Martha takes than Jim, we need to analyze the paths they take around the rectangle.

First, let's understand the paths:
1. Jim walks along the perimeter of the rectangle.
2. Martha walks along the diagonal and then along the sides of the rectangle.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The perimeter of the rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

The diagonal of the rectangle can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

Martha's path consists of one diagonal and two sides of the rectangle. Since she walks along the diagonal and then along the sides, she takes:
\[ d + l + w \]

We are given that Martha takes 400 steps and Jim takes 300 steps. Therefore, we can set up the following equations:
\[ d + l + w = 400 \]
\[ 2l + 2w = 300 \]

We can simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
\[ l + w = 150 \]

Now, we substitute \( l + w = 150 \) into the first equation:
\[ d + 150 = 400 \]
\[ d = 250 \]

So, the length of the diagonal is 250 steps. Now, we need to find out how many more steps Martha takes than Jim:
\[ 400 - 300 = 100 \]

Therefore, Martha takes \(\boxed{100}\) more steps than Jim.","[100, '100']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\), where \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity. The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 = 1\). These solutions are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real roots and satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

First, let's rewrite the expression using the properties of \(\omega\):
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}.
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the fact that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (1 + \omega + \omega^2) - 1 = 2 + 0 - 1 = 1.
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{2}.
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) by breaking it down into two triangles, \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \), and then summing their areas.

First, let's find the area of \( \triangle ABD \). The vertices of \( \triangle ABD \) are \( A(-3, 3) \), \( B(3, 0) \), and \( D(0, 0) \). The formula for the area of a triangle with vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \( A \), \( B \), and \( D \):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABD = \frac{1}{2} \left| -3(0 - 0) + 3(0 - 3) + 0(3 - 0) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 9 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -9 \right| = \frac{9}{2}
\]

Next, let's find the area of \( \triangle BCD \). The vertices of \( \triangle BCD \) are \( B(3, 0) \), \( C(0, -4) \), and \( D(0, 0) \). Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3(-4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 + 0 + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 \right| = 6
\]

Finally, the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle BCD \):
\[
\text{Area of } ABCD = \text{Area of } \triangle ABD + \text{Area of } \triangle BCD = \frac{9}{2} + 6 = \frac{9}{2} + \frac{12}{2} = \frac{21}{2}

Thus, the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is \(\boxed{\frac{21}{2}}\).","[21/2, '\\frac{21}{2}']",13,"[13, '13']",False
