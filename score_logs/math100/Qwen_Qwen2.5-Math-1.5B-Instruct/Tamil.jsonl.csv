"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(\angle DFE = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall that \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\). In this right triangle \(DEF\), \(\angle DFE = 90^\circ\), so \(DE\) is the hypotenuse, \(DF\) is the opposite side to \(\angle D\), and \(EF\) is the adjacent side to \(\angle D\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{DF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
This implies:
\[
DF = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]
We are given that \(EF = 7\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle DEF\), we have:
\[
DE^2 = DF^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting \(DF = 0.7 \cdot DE\) and \(EF = 7\) into the equation, we get:
\[
DE^2 = (0.7 \cdot DE)^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
DE^2 = 0.49 \cdot DE^2 + 49
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
DE^2 - 0.49 \cdot DE^2 = 49
\]
\[
0.51 \cdot DE^2 = 49
\]
Solving for \(DE^2\), we get:
\[
DE^2 = \frac{49}{0.51} = \frac{4900}{51}
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
DE = \sqrt{\frac{4900}{51}} = \frac{\sqrt{4900}}{\sqrt{51}} = \frac{70}{\sqrt{51}} = \frac{70 \sqrt{51}}{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{70\sqrt{51}}{51}}
\]","[(70*sqrt(51))/51, '\\frac{70\\sqrt{51}}{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To solve for \( w \), we need to find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c \).

First, let's express \( z \) and \( c \) in their standard forms:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

The rotation of a complex number \( z \) by an angle \( \theta \) around a point \( c \) can be expressed as:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

First, we need to find \( z - c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Now, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add this result to \( c \):
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

1. **Factorize 242:**
   - Start by checking if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \(242 \div 2 = 121\)
   - So, \(242 = 2 \times 121\)

2. **Factorize 121:**
   - Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by 5. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by 7. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by 11.
   - \(121 \div 11 = 11\)
   - So, \(121 = 11 \times 11\)

3. **Combine the factors:**
   - Therefore, \(242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\)

4. **Simplify the square root:**
   - \(\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}\)
   - Since \(\sqrt{a \times b \times c} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b} \times \sqrt{c}\), we can rewrite it as:
   - \(\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11}\)
   - \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{11^2} = 11\)
   - So, \(\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11\)
   - \(\sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}\)

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to carefully analyze the given information and deduce the correct answer step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - There are 8 properties.
   - Each property can be either true or false.
   - The total number of possible combinations of true and false for these properties is \(2^8 = 256\).

2. **Understand the question:**
   - We need to determine the number of combinations where exactly 3 properties are true and the rest are false.

3. **Calculate the number of combinations:**
   - We need to choose 3 properties out of 8 to be true. The number of ways to choose 3 properties out of 8 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{3}\).
   - The binomial coefficient \(\binom{8}{3}\) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{3!5!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 56 combinations where exactly 3 properties are true and the rest are false.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of combinations where exactly 3 properties are true and the rest are false is \(\boxed{56}\).","[56, '56']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To solve the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we will use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that for any positive integer \(n\),

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k,
\]

where \(\binom{n}{k}\) is the binomial coefficient given by \(\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\).

In our case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to expand the expression \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\).

The general term in the expansion is given by

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k.
\]

We will now compute each term for \(k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\).

1. For \(k = 0\):

\[
\binom{5}{0} (10x^3)^5 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^0 = 1 \cdot 10^5 x^{15} \cdot 1 = 100000x^{15}.
\]

2. For \(k = 1\):

\[
\binom{5}{1} (10x^3)^4 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^1 = 5 \cdot 10^4 x^{12} \cdot -\frac{1}{2x^2} = 5 \cdot 10000 x^{10} \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -25000x^{10}.
\]

3. For \(k = 2\):

\[
\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = 10 \cdot 10^3 x^9 \cdot \frac{1}{4x^4} = 10 \cdot 1000 x^5 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 2500x^5.
\]

4. For \(k = 3\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = 10 \cdot 10^2 x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 x^0 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125.
\]

5. For \(k = 4\):

\[
\binom{5}{4} (10x^3)^1 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^4 = 5 \cdot 10x^3 \cdot \frac{1}{16x^8} = 5 \cdot 10 x^{-5} \cdot \frac{1}{16} = \frac{50}{16x^5} = \frac{25}{8x^5}.
\]

6. For \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{5}{5} (10x^3)^0 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5 = 1 \cdot 1 \cdot -\frac{1}{32x^{10}} = -\frac{1}{32x^{10}}.
\]

Adding all these terms together, we get the expanded form of the expression:

\[
100000x^{15} - 25000x^{10} + 2500x^5 - 125 + \frac{25}{8x^5} - \frac{1}{32x^{10}}.
\]

Thus, the final answer is

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to show that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 0 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 2 + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) becomes:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, calculate the product \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

However, we need to show that the product is congruent to 0 modulo 7. Let's re-evaluate the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) more carefully. Notice that:

\[
n + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

But we need to check if any of these terms are congruent to 0 modulo 7. Since \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), none of \(n + 2\), \(n + 4\), or \(n + 6\) are congruent to 0 modulo 7. However, we can see that:

\[
n + 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

This means that \(n + 6\) is not zero modulo 7, but we need to check the product of the three terms. Since \(n + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}\) and \(n + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}\), and \(n + 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}\), the product \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is not zero modulo 7. However, the problem statement asks to show that the product is zero modulo 7, which is not true based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the correct interpretation should be that the product is not zero modulo 7, but the problem statement might have a different context or a different interpretation. Given the problem's context, the correct answer should be:

Now, we need to find the value of \(x + y\) for the point \((8, 2)\):

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \( f(a) = b \), \( f(b) = c \), and \( f(c) = a \). We are then asked to find the value of \(a + b + c\).

First, let's factor the denominator of the function:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the function can be rewritten as:
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}. \]

We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that:
\[ f(a) = b, \]
\[ f(b) = c, \]
\[ f(c) = a. \]

Let's start by finding the fixed points of the function, i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \( f(x) = x \). This means solving the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)} = x. \]
Multiplying both sides by \((x - 7)(x + 2)\) gives:
\[ 2x = x(x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[ 2x = x(x^2 - 5x - 14), \]
\[ 2x = x^3 - 5x^2 - 14x, \]
\[ x^3 - 5x^2 - 16x = 0. \]
Factoring out \(x\), we get:
\[ x(x^2 - 5x - 16) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 0, \]
\[ x^2 - 5x - 16 = 0. \]
The quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x - 16 = 0\) can be solved using the quadratic formula \(x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = -16\):
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 64}}{2} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{89}}{2}. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = \frac{5 + \sqrt{89}}{2}, \]
\[ x = \frac{5 - \sqrt{89}}{2}. \]
Therefore, the fixed points of the function are \(0\), \(\frac{5 + \sqrt{89}}{2}\), and \(\frac{5 - \sqrt{89}}{2}\).

We need to check if these fixed points satisfy the condition \( f(a) = b \), \( f(b) = c \), and \( f(c) = a \). Since they are fixed points, we have:
\[ f(0) = 0, \]
\[ f\left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{89}}{2}\right) = \frac{5 + \sqrt{89}}{2}, \]
\[ f\left(\frac{5 - \sqrt{89}}{2}\right) = \frac{5 - \sqrt{89}}{2}. \]
So, we can take \(a = 0\), \(b = \frac{5 + \sqrt{89}}{2}\), and \(c = \frac{5 - \sqrt{89}}{2}\).

Finally, we need to find the value of \(a + b + c\):
\[ a + b + c = 0 + \frac{5 + \sqrt{89}}{2} + \frac{5 - \sqrt{89}}{2} = \frac{5 + \sqrt{89} + 5 - \sqrt{89}}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5. \]

First, let's denote the matrix by \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). We need to find the operator norm of \( A \), which is the maximum value of \(\frac{\|A\bold{v}\|}{\|\bold{v}\|}\) for all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v}\).

The operator norm of \( A \) is given by the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), where \( A^T \) is the transpose of \( A \). Since \( A \) is a real matrix, \( A^T = A \), so we need to find the eigenvalues of \( A^2 \).

Calculate \( A^2 \):
\[
A^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 0 \\ 0 & 4 \end{pmatrix} = 4I,

where \( I \) is the identity matrix. The eigenvalues of \( A^2 \) are the diagonal elements of \( A^2 \), which are both 4. Therefore, the eigenvalues of \( A \) are \( \pm 2 \).

The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^2 \), which is \( \sqrt{4} = 2 \). Therefore, the smallest value of \( C \) such that \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \( C = 2 \).

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\]

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\), \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\), and \(z^2 = \frac{1}{z^3}\). Thus, the expression can be rewritten as:

From the equation \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\), we can isolate \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z\) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Adding these together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8

Adding these together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17

So, \(18_9 = 17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0

So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

\[
40_9 = 4 \cdot 9^1 + 0 \cdot 9^0 = 36_{10}

Since \(36_{10}\) matches our earlier subtraction result, our conversion is correct.

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

Next, simplify the first term:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

So the expression now becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]

To combine these two terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second term with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Now, combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Recall the Pythagorean identity: \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]

Simplify the fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in the given polynomial equations, we need to equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms from the given polynomials. Let's start by writing down the given polynomials and their sum:

\[3t^2 + 5t + a\]
\[4t^2 + bt - 2\]
\[12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\]

First, we add the first two polynomials:

\[(3t^2 + 5t + a) + (4t^2 + bt - 2) = 7t^2 + (5 + b)t + (a - 2)\]

Now, we know that this sum is equal to the third polynomial:

\[7t^2 + (5 + b)t + (a - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\]

Since the left side of the equation is a quadratic polynomial and the right side is a quartic polynomial, we can see that there is no \(t^4\) or \(t^3\) term on the left side. This means that the coefficients of \(t^4\) and \(t^3\) on the left side must be zero. Therefore, we can ignore the \(t^4\) and \(t^3\) terms on the left side and focus on the quadratic and linear terms:

\[7t^2 + (5 + b)t + (a - 2) = -8t^2 - 16t + 6\]

Now, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms:

1. Coefficient of \(t^2\): \(7 = -8\) (This is not possible, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to recognize that the given polynomials are not directly comparable as they are not of the same degree. The correct interpretation is that the given polynomials are the factors of the quartic polynomial, and we need to find the correct values of \(a\) and \(b\) by comparing the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms after factoring the quartic polynomial.)

Let's factor the quartic polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). We can use the Rational Root Theorem to find the possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of the constant term (6) divided by the factors of the leading coefficient (12). The possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{6}, \pm \frac{3}{2}\).

By testing these possible roots, we find that \(t = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. We can use synthetic division to divide \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\) by \(t - \frac{1}{2}\):

The quotient is \(12t^3 + 32t^2 + 12t - 4\) and the remainder is 2. Since the remainder is not zero, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to factor the quartic polynomial correctly and compare the coefficients of the quadratic and linear terms.

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) are equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a). \]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a(a^2) = a^3. \]

Since the function is continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit must equal the right-hand limit:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = \frac{1 + \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 + 3}{2} = 2, \quad a = \frac{1 - \sqrt{1 + 8}}{2} = \frac{1 - 3}{2} = -1. \]

However, we need to check if these values satisfy the condition that the function is continuous at \(x = a\). If \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\ 0 & \text{if } x < 0, \end{cases} \]
which is clearly continuous at \(x = 0\).

If \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} 2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\ 2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2, \end{cases} \]

If \(a = -1\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} -x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1,\\ -x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1, \end{cases} \]
which is continuous at \(x = -1\).

Therefore, the possible values of \(a\) are \(0\), \(2\), and \(-1\). However, the problem asks for the value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition, and typically in such problems, the non-trivial solution is preferred. Hence, the value of \(a\) is:

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

Then,
\[f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(4x^2 - 4x + 1).\]
We need this to equal \(x\):

"To solve the given problem, we need to simplify the expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator and the denominator separately.

### Simplifying the Numerator
The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities:
\[
\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A+B) + \cos (A-B)]
\]
\[
\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A-B) - \cos (A+B)]
\]

Applying these identities:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ]
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ]
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ]
\]
\[
\sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ]
\]

Substituting these into the numerator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ]

Combining like terms:
\[

\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} (2\cos 25^\circ + 2\cos 85^\circ)
\]
\[
= \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]

### Simplifying the Denominator
The denominator is:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ

\sin A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (A+B) + \sin (A-B)]
\]
\[
\cos A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\sin (A+B) - \sin (A-B)]

Applying these identities:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin (-15^\circ)]
\]
\[
\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin (-15^\circ)]
\]
\[
\cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ)]
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ)]

Substituting these into the denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin (-15^\circ)] - \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin (-15^\circ)] + \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ)] - \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ)]
\]

Combining like terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2} (\sin 25^\circ + \sin (-15^\circ) - \sin 85^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ) + \sin 25^\circ - \sin (-15^\circ) - \sin 85^\circ + \sin (-15^\circ))
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} (2\sin 25^\circ - 2\sin 85^\circ)
\]
\[
= \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]

### Simplifying the Expression
Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities:
\[

\]
\[
\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos \left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)

Applying these identities:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ
\]
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ

Substituting these into the expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ}{2 \cos 55^\circ \sin 30^\circ}
\]
\[
= \frac{\cos 30^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ}

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We do this by dividing 42 by 5, then dividing the quotient by 5 again, and so on, until the quotient is less than 5. The sum of these quotients gives us the number of trailing zeros.

1. Divide 42 by 5:
   \[

   This means there are 8 factors of 5 in \(42!\).

2. Divide 8 by 5:

Adding these together, the total number of factors of 5 in \(42!\) is:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) and the terms \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are defined only when \( -1 \le y \le 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \), respectively.

To find the maximum value, we can consider specific values of \( x \) and \( y \). Let's try \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
We need to maximize \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). Let \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To find the critical points, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-2x}{2 \sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 2(1 - 2x^2) = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]
The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1, which occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O(0,0,0)\), \(A(1,2,3)\), and \(B(-3,-2,1)\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]
Expanding this determinant, we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6)
\]
\[
= 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]
So, the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half of this magnitude:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

These are the non-real fifth roots of unity, excluding 1. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 = 1 \), and they are \( 1, \omega, \omega^2, \omega^3, \omega^4 \), where \( \omega = e^{2\pi i / 5} \).

Given \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we identify that \( z = \omega^2 \) or \( z = \omega^3 \) (since \( \omega^2 + \omega^3 = -1 - \omega - \omega^4 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \)). For simplicity, let's assume \( z = \omega^2 \). Then, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \).

Since \( z = \omega^2 \), we have \( z^5 = (\omega^2)^5 = \omega^{10} = 1 \). Therefore, \( z^{85} = (z^5)^{17} = 1^{17} = 1 \). Similarly, \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 1 \). Thus, we have:

   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median in the ratio 2:1. This means that if \( AD \) is a median, then \( AG:GD = 2:1 \).

2. **Use the given information about the area:**
   The area of triangle \( ABC \) is given as 144 square units. The centroid \( G \) divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of the triangles \( AGB \), \( BGC \), and \( CGA \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles in the box based on the given conditions. Let's denote the total number of marbles in the box as \( x \).

1. **Condition 1**: There are 3 marbles in the box that are not in the group of 12 marbles.
   This means that the remaining marbles in the box are \( x - 12 \).

2. **Condition 2**: There are 24 marbles in the box that are not in the group of 24 marbles.
   This means that the remaining marbles in the box are \( x - 24 \).

3. **Condition 3**: There are 8 marbles in the box that are not in the group of 8 marbles.
   This means that the remaining marbles in the box are \( x - 8 \).

4. **Condition 4**: There are 10 marbles in the box that are not in the group of 10 marbles.
   This means that the remaining marbles in the box are \( x - 10 \).

5. **Condition 5**: There are 6 marbles in the box that are not in the group of 6 marbles.
   This means that the remaining marbles in the box are \( x - 6 \).

Since all these conditions must be true simultaneously, we can set up the following equations:
\[ x - 12 = x - 24 = x - 8 = x - 10 = x - 6 \]

However, these equations are not consistent with each other. Instead, we need to find a common value for \( x \) that satisfies all the conditions. Let's consider the least common multiple (LCM) of the numbers 12, 24, 8, 10, and 6. The LCM of these numbers is 120.

If we assume \( x = 120 \), then:
- The number of marbles that are not in the group of 12 marbles is \( 120 - 12 = 108 \).
- The number of marbles that are not in the group of 24 marbles is \( 120 - 24 = 96 \).
- The number of marbles that are not in the group of 8 marbles is \( 120 - 8 = 112 \).
- The number of marbles that are not in the group of 10 marbles is \( 120 - 10 = 110 \).
- The number of marbles that are not in the group of 6 marbles is \( 120 - 6 = 114 \).

Clearly, these values do not match the conditions given in the problem. Therefore, we need to find a different approach.

- There are 8 marbles that are not in the group of 8 marbles.
- There are 10 marbles that are not in the group of 10 marbles.
- There are 6 marbles that are not in the group of 6 marbles.

The only way to satisfy all these conditions is if the total number of marbles in the box is the sum of the marbles in each group minus the overlaps. However, since the problem does not provide enough information to determine the overlaps, we can assume that the total number of marbles in the box is the sum of the marbles in each group minus the overlaps.

Therefore, the total number of marbles in the box is:

\[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]

"Let's denote the number of people as \( n \) and the amount of money each person has as \( x \). According to the problem, the total amount of money is $200$ if each person has $x$ amount of money, and $500$ if each person has $x+1$ amount of money. We can set up the following equations based on this information:

1. \( n \cdot x = 200 \)
2. \( n \cdot (x + 1) = 500 \)

From the first equation, we can express \( n \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ n = \frac{200}{x} \]

Substituting this expression for \( n \) into the second equation, we get:

\[ \frac{200}{x} \cdot (x + 1) = 500 \]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot \frac{x + 1}{x} = 500 \]

\[ 200 \left(1 + \frac{1}{x}\right) = 500 \]

\[ 200 + \frac{200}{x} = 500 \]

Subtracting 200 from both sides, we get:

\[ \frac{200}{x} = 300 \]

Solving for \( x \), we multiply both sides by \( x \):

\[ 200 = 300x \]

\[ x = \frac{200}{300} = \frac{2}{3} \]

Now that we have \( x = \frac{2}{3} \), we can find \( n \) using the first equation:

\[ n = \frac{200}{x} = \frac{200}{\frac{2}{3}} = 200 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 300 \]

So, there are 300 people. Now, we need to find out how much money each person has if each person has $x+1$ amount of money:

\[ x + 1 = \frac{2}{3} + 1 = \frac{2}{3} + \frac{3}{3} = \frac{5}{3} \]

The total amount of money is still $500$, so the amount of money each person has is:

We know that \(2^2 = 4\), so we can substitute this into the expression:

Next, we need to calculate \(5^7\). The value of \(5^7\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of words that can be formed using the letters of the word ""� otherwise"" (which translates to ""in English as ""� otherwise""). The word ""� otherwise"" has 10 letters, with the letter ""�"" appearing 2 times and the letter "" otherwise"" appearing 8 times.

The formula to calculate the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""� otherwise"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 10.
- The letter ""�"" appears 2 times.
- The letter "" otherwise"" appears 8 times.

So, the number of distinct permutations is:

\[
\frac{10!}{2! \cdot 8!}
\]

First, we calculate \( 10! \) (10 factorial):

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3628800
\]

Next, we calculate \( 2! \) (2 factorial):

\[
2! = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

And \( 8! \) (8 factorial):

\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320
\]

Now, we substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\frac{10!}{2! \cdot 8!} = \frac{3628800}{2 \times 40320} = \frac{3628800}{80640} = 45

1. **Express the denominator in terms of powers of 10:**
   The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can rewrite this as:
   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2

2. **Simplify the fraction:**
   We can separate the fraction into two parts:
   \[
   \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{10^7} = 2160.5 \cdot 10^{-7}

   To express this in the form \(a \cdot 10^b\) where \(1 \leq a < 10\), we need to adjust the decimal point in 2160.5. We can write 2160.5 as 2.1605 times 1000 (which is \(10^3\)):

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

This simplifies to:
\[

First, recall that the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We can calculate \(\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\|\) as follows:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]
So, we have:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta \implies 7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}
\]
The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies \(\sin \theta = \frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) or \(\theta = \frac{5\pi}{6}\).

Next, we use the dot product formula:
\[
\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b} = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \cos \theta
\]
We need to find \(\cos \theta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos^2 \theta = 1 - \sin^2 \theta = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \implies \cos \theta = \pm \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Thus, the dot product \(\mathbf{a} \cdot \mathbf{b}\) can be:

First, we need to express \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \):

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the cotangent function:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x.
\]
Using this identity, we can rewrite the first term:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to handle the second and third terms. We will use the identity for the sine of a double angle:
\[
\sin 2x = 2 \sin x \cos x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin 20^\circ = 2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\sin^2 20^\circ = (2 \sin 10^\circ \cos 10^\circ)^2 = 4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we can express \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ}\) as:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 10^\circ \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 20^\circ\right)^2} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

For the third term, we use the identity for the sine of a triple angle:
\[
\sin 3x = 3 \sin x - 4 \sin^3 x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\sin 40^\circ = 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ.
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
\sin^2 40^\circ = (2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ)^2 = 4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{4 \sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x = 1\), we can express \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ}\) as:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ \cos^2 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\left(\frac{1}{2} \sin 40^\circ\right)^2} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the identity:
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = \csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x.
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we can sum the three terms:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), we get:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} \quad \text{and} \quad \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]
Using the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3 \tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3 \tan^2 x}\), we can find that:
\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3 \tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3 \tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]
Solving this equation, we find that:
\[
\tan 10^\circ = \sqrt{3} \tan 30^\circ = \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = 1.
\]
Thus, \(\tan^2 10^\circ = 1\), \(\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\), and \(\tan^2 40^\circ = 9\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
3 + 1 + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{9} = 3 + 1 + \frac{3}{9} + \frac{1}{9} = 3 + 1 + \frac{4}{9} = 4 + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{36}{9} + \frac{4}{9} = \frac{40}{9}.

\[

\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

To find \( n \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[ t + 2 = kt \]
Rearranging this equation, we get:
\[ t + 2 = kt \implies 2 = kt - t \implies 2 = t(k - 1) \]
This means that \( t \) must be a divisor of 2. The divisors of 2 are 1 and 2. However, since \( t \) must be an odd number, the only possible value for \( t \) is 1.

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the context and the mathematical operations involved. However, the problem statement is not clear about the specific mathematical operations or the context of the numbers \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(\sqrt{3}\).

"To solve the given equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we need to simplify the expression inside the sine function.

First, let's denote \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\). This means that \(\tan(\theta) = x\). The angle \(\theta\) is such that \(\theta\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \theta < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Next, we know that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Let's denote \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). This means that \(\tan(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\). The angle \(\phi\) is such that \(\phi\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \phi < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Now, we need to find the sum \(\theta + \phi\). Since \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(x)\) and \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\), we have:
\[
\tan(\theta + \phi) = \frac{\tan(\theta) + \tan(\phi)}{1 - \tan(\theta)\tan(\phi)} = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{1 - x \cdot \frac{1}{x}} = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{1 - 1} = \frac{x + \frac{1}{x}}{0}
\]
This expression is undefined, which means that \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\) (since the tangent of \(\frac{\pi}{2}\) is undefined).

Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \( t \) and \( u \) such that the two given parametric lines intersect. The parametric equations of the lines are:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ -10 - 9t \\ 1 - 2t \end{pmatrix}
\]

\[

\]

For the lines to intersect, the coordinates must be equal. Therefore, we set up the following system of equations:

1. \( 3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \)
2. \( -10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \)
3. \( 1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \)

We will solve this system step by step.

### Step 1: Solve the first equation for \( t \) in terms of \( u \)

\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u
\]

Add 5 to both sides:

\[
8 + 2t = 4u
\]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
2t = 4u - 8
\]

Divide by 2:

\[
t = 2u - 4
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( t = 2u - 4 \) into the second equation

\[
-10 - 9(2u - 4) = -3 - 18u
\]

Distribute the -9:

\[
-10 - 18u + 36 = -3 - 18u
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
26 - 18u = -3 - 18u
\]

Add \( 18u \) to both sides:

\[
26 = -3
\]

This is a contradiction, which means there is no solution for \( u \) and \( t \) that satisfies all three equations simultaneously. Therefore, the lines do not intersect.

Since the lines do not intersect, there is no value of \( u \) and \( t \) that satisfies all three equations. Therefore, the lines are skew.

"Given the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to determine the area of the quadrilateral formed by these points and then find the area of the square that circumscribes this quadrilateral.

First, let's identify the shape formed by these points. The points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\) form a rectangle. The length of the rectangle is the distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\), which is \(10\) (since \(5 - (-5) = 10\)). The width of the rectangle is the distance between \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\), which is \(8\) (since \(4 - (-4) = 8\)).

The area of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[

Next, we need to find the area of the square that circumscribes this rectangle. The side length of the square is equal to the diagonal of the rectangle. The diagonal of the rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[

Thus, the side length of the square is \(2\sqrt{41}\), and the area of the square is:
\[

\]
we need to find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\).

We start by using the distributive property of the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} + (2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Next, we distribute the cross product:
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c}) - (\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
and
\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - \mathbf{0} = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}).
\]

Combining these results, we get:

\]

Substituting the given cross products:
\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC}\), quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(\overline{AC}\) as the height from \(A\) to \(CD\). Let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows: \(AB = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), and \(DA = d\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:

We need to find the value of \(AC\). Since the area of the trapezoid is 42, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\).

\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin(\alpha - \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

We know that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Now we substitute these values into the expressions for \(\sin(\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin(\alpha - \beta)\):
\[
\sin(\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}

\[

Next, we find the product \(\sin(\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin(\alpha - \beta)\):
\[

2. The total number of students in the first group is 24.
3. The total number of students in the second group is 48.

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**

   Simplifying both sides, we get:

3. **Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**

   Simplifying further:

7. **Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:**

8. **Solve for the two possible values of \(x\):**

9. **Verify the solutions:**
   - For \(x = 66\):
     \[
     \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16

Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we know that:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is an isosceles triangle with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), and \( AD = 10 \) with \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to find the length of \( BC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( AM \) is the median and also the altitude in the isosceles triangle \( \triangle ABC \). This means \( \angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 11^2 + BM^2 \]
\[ AB^2 = 121 + BM^2 \]

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \) and \( BC = 2BM \). Let \( BM = x \), then \( BC = 2x \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Since \( D \) is on \( BC \) and \( AD = 10 \), we can use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(3\theta) = BC^2 \]
Since \( BD = DC = x \) and \( BC = 2x \), we have:
\[ x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(3\theta) = (2x)^2 \]
\[ 2x^2 - 2x^2 \cos(3\theta) = 4x^2 \]
\[ 2x^2 (1 - \cos(3\theta)) = 4x^2 \]
\[ 1 - \cos(3\theta) = 2 \]
\[ \cos(3\theta) = -1 \]
This implies \( 3\theta = 180^\circ \) or \( \theta = 60^\circ \).

Since \( \theta = 60^\circ \), \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) and \( \angle BDC = 180^\circ \). This means \( \triangle BDC \) is a straight line, which is not possible in this context. However, we can use the fact that \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle to find the length of \( BC \).

Since \( \angle BAC = 60^\circ \), \( \triangle ABC \) is an equilateral triangle. Therefore, \( AB = AC = BC \). Let \( BC = y \). Then \( AB = AC = y \).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ y^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{y}{2}\right)^2 \]
\[ y^2 = 121 + \frac{y^2}{4} \]
\[ 4y^2 = 484 + y^2 \]

### Step 1: Solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

We start by solving the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes \(y^2 + 4y < 21\). Rearranging terms, we get:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
This is a quadratic inequality. To solve it, we first find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
So the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the positive root \(y = 3\). The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is a parabola opening upwards, so it is negative between the roots \(-7\) and \(3\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the interval \(0 \leq y < 3\). Therefore, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of all parts, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

### Step 2: Solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\)

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2\) is always true. Therefore, it does not impose any additional restrictions on \(x\).

### Step 3: Combine the results

The solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is the intersection of the solutions to the two inequalities. From the first inequality, we have \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\), and from the second inequality, we have no additional restrictions. Therefore, the solution is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

The final answer is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the second given equation that:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
or:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we need to find \(p\). We also have the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\), we can express the equation as:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12,
\]
or:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
so:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
We now have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we get \(p = \frac{24}{s}\). Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3\frac{24}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72,
\]
so:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
and:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Then:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}.

"To determine the percentage of students who passed the exam in the 13th year, we need to observe the trend in the given data and use it to make an educated guess. The data provided shows the percentage of students who passed the exam in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th years. Let's analyze the trend:

1. **9th Year:**
   - Average score for students who passed: \(41.1\%\)
   - Average score for students who failed: \(39.4\%\)

2. **10th Year:**
   - Average score for students who passed: \(34.4\%\)
   - Average score for students who failed: \(33.1\%\)

3. **11th Year:**
   - Average score for students who passed: \(20.6\%\)
   - Average score for students who failed: \(13.8\%\)

4. **12th Year:**
   - Average score for students who passed: \(11.6\%\)
   - Average score for students who failed: \(8.6\%\)

We observe that the average score for students who passed is decreasing each year, while the average score for students who failed is also decreasing but at a slower rate. To estimate the average score for students who passed in the 13th year, we can assume that the trend will continue, meaning the average score for students who passed will continue to decrease.

Let's calculate the average decrease in the average score for students who passed from one year to the next:

- From the 9th to the 10th year: \(41.1\% - 34.4\% = 6.7\%\)
- From the 10th to the 11th year: \(34.4\% - 20.6\% = 13.8\%\)
- From the 11th to the 12th year: \(20.6\% - 11.6\% = 9.0\%\)

The average decrease in the average score for students who passed from one year to the next is:

\[
\frac{6.7\% + 13.8\% + 9.0\%}{3} = \frac{29.5\%}{3} \approx 9.83\%
\]

Using this average decrease, we can estimate the average score for students who passed in the 13th year:

\[
11.6\% - 9.83\% = 1.77\%
\]

Since the average score for students who passed in the 13th year is approximately \(1.77\%\), and this score is likely to be around the same level as the average score for students who passed in the previous year (12th year), we can round it to the nearest whole number. Therefore, the estimated percentage of students who passed the exam in the 13th year is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, i.e., \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in the given diagram. The diagram shows a square with a side length of 3 units, and a semicircle is drawn on each side of the square. The shaded region is the area of the square minus the area of the four semicircles.

First, let's calculate the area of the square. The side length of the square is 3 units, so the area of the square is:
\[
3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of one semicircle. The diameter of each semicircle is 3 units, so the radius of each semicircle is:
\[
\frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ units}
\]
The area of a full circle with radius 1.5 units is:
\[
\pi \times (1.5)^2 = \pi \times 2.25 = 2.25\pi \text{ square units}
\]
Since each semicircle is half of a full circle, the area of one semicircle is:
\[
\frac{2.25\pi}{2} = 1.125\pi \text{ square units}
\]
There are four semicircles, so the total area of the four semicircles is:
\[
4 \times 1.125\pi = 4.5\pi \text{ square units}
\]

Now, we subtract the total area of the four semicircles from the area of the square to find the area of the shaded region:

Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle T = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin R = \frac{\text{opposite to } R}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}\).

Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows:
- \(ST = 2k\) (opposite to \(\angle R\))
- \(RS = 5k\) (hypotenuse)

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find the length of the remaining side \(RT\):
\[
RT = \sqrt{RS^2 - ST^2} = \sqrt{(5k)^2 - (2k)^2} = \sqrt{25k^2 - 4k^2} = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(0^2 - 3) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}

Thus, the y-intercept is \( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \). This means that the parabola intersects the y-axis at \( y = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not in the domain. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = \frac{2}{-2} = -1 \) (not in the domain) and \( x = \frac{-6}{-2} = 3 \) (not in the domain \( x > 3 \)). Therefore, there are no solutions in the domain \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. By trial, we find that \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). We can use numerical methods or graphing to find that there are no real solutions in the domain \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

"To find the function \( g(x) \) which is the translation of \( f(x-1) \) by 1 unit to the right, we need to understand that \( g(x) = f(x) \). This is because translating a function \( f(x) \) by 1 unit to the right results in the function \( f(x-1) \), and then translating it back by 1 unit to the left results in the function \( f(x) \).

Given the function \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \), we can directly state that \( g(x) = f(x) \).

Therefore, the function \( g(x) \) is:

"Given the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2, \alpha_1\alpha_3, \alpha_1\alpha_4, \alpha_2\alpha_3, \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_3\alpha_4\). The sum of the roots of this polynomial is given by the coefficient of \(x^5\) term (which is zero in this case) divided by the leading coefficient (which is 1), so the sum of the roots is zero. This means:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
We already know this from Vieta's formulas.

Now, we need to find the product of the roots taken two at a time. The product of the roots taken two at a time is given by the coefficient of \(x^2\) term (which is zero in this case) divided by the leading coefficient (which is 1), so the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero. This means:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
We already know this from Vieta's formulas.

Finally, we use the identity for the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time. The sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time is given by the coefficient of \(x\) term (which is zero in this case) divided by the leading coefficient (which is 1), so the sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time is zero. This means:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
We already know this from Vieta's formulas.

From the above, we can conclude that the values of the expressions are:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -1, \quad \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = -1, \quad \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = -1.

"To solve the problem, we need to convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal. Here are the steps to do that:

1. **Understand the Fraction**: The fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) means 137 divided by 500.

2. **Perform the Division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. This can be done using long division or a calculator.

   - Using long division:
     - 500 goes into 137 zero times, so we write 0 before the decimal point.
     - We then consider 1370 (by adding a decimal point and a zero).
     - 500 goes into 1370 two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)).
     - Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
     - Bring down another zero to make it 3700.
     - 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)).
     - Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
     - Bring down another zero to make it 2000.
     - 500 goes into 2000 four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)).
     - Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

   - Therefore, the division gives us \(0.274\).

3. **Verify the Result**: We can verify the result by multiplying \(0.274\) by 500 to see if we get back to 137.
   \[
   0.274 \times 500 = 137

4. **Conclusion**: The decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"Given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as the center and \(AB/AD = k\), we need to find the ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the triangle \(OAB\).

First, let's denote the length of \(AB\) as \(2a\) and the length of \(AD\) as \(2b\). Since \(O\) is the center of the rectangle, the coordinates of \(O\) are \((0,0)\), \(A\) is \((-a, b)\), \(B\) is \((a, b)\), and \(D\) is \((-a, -b)\).

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

The ratio of the area of the rectangle to the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:

\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), which is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \), which is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

- 壁 AIK = \$27.47
- 壁 EK = \$35.23
- 壁 JAK = \$37.37
- 壁 MOK = \$26.52

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total revenue:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52

Let's add them step by step:
\[

The sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal must be the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's find the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6

Since the sum of each row is the same, we have:

Solving for \( n \):
\[
1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n

So, \( n = 7 \).

Now, let's verify that this value of \( n \) satisfies the conditions for the columns and diagonals. The sum of the first column is:

The sum of the second column is:
\[

The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 2n + 1 = 2(7) + 1 = 15
\]
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[

Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

Next, we simplify the denominator:
