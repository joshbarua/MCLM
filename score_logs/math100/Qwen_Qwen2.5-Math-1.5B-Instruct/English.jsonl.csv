"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We know that \(\sin D = 0.7\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\angle D\) is opposite to side \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DE\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = 0.7
\]
We are given that \(EF = 7\). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \(DE\), we solve for \(DE\) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DE\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) counter-clockwise, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Substituting the given values:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) counter-clockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( a + bi \) by \(\theta\) counter-clockwise is equivalent to multiplying it by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, we multiply \( z' \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2}i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) counter-clockwise is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

First, let's find the prime factorization of 242:
1. Check if 242 is divisible by 2 (the smallest prime number). Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 121
   \]
2. Now, we need to factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. Next, we check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. Next, we check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Next, we check if it is divisible by 7, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11.
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]
   So, we can write:
   \[
   121 = 11 \times 11
   \]
   Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
   \[
   242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
   \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2 \times 11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table with the condition that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosace-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the round table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them in a circle is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:**
   Within the Pierre-Rosace-Thomas block, there are 3 people who can be arranged in any order. The number of ways to arrange 3 people is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the arrangements:**
   To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with the given condition, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange the 3 people within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the binomial coefficient:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k \left(\frac{1}{x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Now, combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

Simplify each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
x^{15-5(3)} = x^0 = 1
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} \times 1 = 10 \times 100 \times -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \times -\frac{100}{8} = 10 \times -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify the terms inside the parentheses:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

Now, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center until it coincides with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it can be rotated around its center by certain angles and still look the same.

The sum of the angles around the center of the pentagon is 360 degrees. Since a regular pentagon has five equal sides and angles, it can be divided into five equal parts. Therefore, the angle of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position is given by dividing 360 degrees by 5.

\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Thus, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise until it coincides with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). We will consider the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

First, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). However, we are given that \(x > 7\), which means we need to re-evaluate our assumption. The correct interpretation is that the fourth vertex should be such that the x-coordinate is greater than 7. Therefore, we need to consider the other possible configuration of the vertices.

If we consider the vertices \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\) such that \(D\) is the fourth vertex, we can use the property that the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is equal to the vector \(\overrightarrow{DC}\). The vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is:

\overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)

\overrightarrow{DC} = (7-x, 4-y)
\]

Setting \(\overrightarrow{AB} = \overrightarrow{DC}\), we get:
\[

"To determine the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these are the points where the function is undefined and potentially has vertical asymptotes.

First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
So, the function can be rewritten as:
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}. \]
The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, which happens at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \), so \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we determine the horizontal asymptote. For a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) where \( P(x) \) and \( Q(x) \) are polynomials, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Finally, we calculate \( a + b + c \):

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) for which the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is defined as
\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\|=1} \|A\bold{v}\|.
\]
This is equivalent to the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^*A \), where \( A^* \) is the conjugate transpose of \( A \). For a real matrix, the conjugate transpose is the same as the transpose, so \( A^* = A^T \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I)\):
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16.
\]
We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]
This gives us the eigenvalues \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the largest singular value of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is 4, and the smallest positive real number \( C \) for which the inequality \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\) is

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we need to understand the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This is because multiplying 1 by itself any number of times will always result in 1.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Identify the base and the exponent in the expression \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\).
   - The base is 1.
   - The exponent is \(2^{235423523}\).

2. Apply the property of exponents that states \(a^b = 1\) if \(a = 1\) for any real number \(b\).
   - In this case, \(a = 1\) and \(b = 2^{235423523}\).

3. Since the base is 1, raising 1 to any power will always result in 1.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a fifth root of unity. The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) must be a root of the polynomial \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0. \]

We need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[ z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3. \]

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \):

\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

Therefore, the value of the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**
3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\).**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8

Adding these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\)

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9

\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8

Adding these values together:
\[

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0

1. Rewrite \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\).
2. Find a common denominator for the two fractions.
3. Combine the fractions and simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the given expression:
\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substitute this into the expression:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Simplify the first fraction:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}

Now, find a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). Rewrite the second fraction with this common denominator:

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( 10t = 3s + g \)
2. \( 2t + g = s \)

We need to find the number of treeks that weigh as much as one squig. Let's denote this number by \( x \). Therefore, we need to find \( x \) such that \( xt = s \).

First, we solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = s - 2t \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ 10t = 4s - 2t \]
\[ 12t = 4s \]
\[ 3t = s \]

Now we have \( s = 3t \). We substitute this back into the equation \( xt = s \):

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately:

\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 2 to solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into equations 3 and 4:

For equation 3:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our values of \(a\) and \(b\).

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

   where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

   The tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour.

3. **Rate of Water level rise:**
   The water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour.

4. **Relating Volume and Height:**
   Since the tank is being filled at a constant rate, the rate at which the volume of water increases is equal to the rate at which the water level rises multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the cylinder. The cross-sectional area \( A \) of the cylinder is:
   \[
   A = \pi r^2

5. **Setting Up the Equation:**
   The rate of change of volume \( \frac{dV}{dt} \) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}

   We know:
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{dh}{dt} = 4

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and ensure that it is surjective, meaning it takes on all real values.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a^3\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). At \(x = a\), \(f(a) = 3a\).

### Step 3: Ensure the function is surjective
For \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, it must take on all real values. This means the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(3a\) (as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\)). For \(f(x)\) to be surjective, we need \(a^3 \leq 3a\). Solving this inequality:
  \[
  a^3 \leq 3a \implies a(a^2 - 3) \leq 0.
  \]
  Since \(a > 0\), we have \(a^2 \leq 3 \implies a \leq \sqrt{3}\). Therefore, \(0 < a \leq \sqrt{3}\).

- If \(a < 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(3a\) (as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\)). The maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^3\). For \(f(x)\) to be surjective, we need \(3a \leq a^3\). Solving this inequality:
  \[
  3a \leq a^3 \implies a(a^2 - 3) \geq 0.
  \]
  Since \(a < 0\), we have \(a^2 \geq 3 \implies a \leq -\sqrt{3}\). Therefore, \(a \leq -\sqrt{3}\).

### Step 4: Determine the largest value of \(a\)
From the analysis above, the largest value of \(a\) such that \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\sqrt{3}\).

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the radius \( r \) is given by \( r^2 = 34 - c \). We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \( r = 1 \) and thus \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we have:

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + 1 - \lambda) = 0.
\]
This equation has solutions \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\), which simplifies to \(1 \leq \lambda \leq 4\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let \(y = f(x)\). Then \(f(f(x)) = f(y) = x\), so we need to solve \(f(y) = x\). This gives us:
\[
\lambda y(1 - y) = x.
\]
Since \(y = f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\), we substitute \(y\) into the equation:
\[
\lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = x.
\]
This is a complicated equation, so we will look for specific values of \(\lambda\) that allow for non-trivial solutions. We know that for \(\lambda = 1\), \(f(x) = x(1 - x)\), and the only fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). For \(\lambda = 2\), \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x)\), and the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). For \(\lambda = 3\), \(f(x) = 3x(1 - x)\), and the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{3}\). For \(\lambda = 4\), \(f(x) = 4x(1 - x)\), and the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{2}\).

We need to check if there are any values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([1, 4]\) for which there exists an \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) for different values of \(\lambda\), we find that for \(\lambda = 2\), the function \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x)\) has the property that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) for some \(x \in (0,1)\). Specifically, if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), then \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 0\) and \(f(0) = 0\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2}\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the given conditions is \(\lambda = 2\).

\]
we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Using the angle addition formulas, we can rewrite the terms involving products of cosines and sines:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Again, using the angle addition formulas, we can rewrite the terms involving products of sines and cosines:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos(90^\circ - x)\) and \(\cos x = \sin(90^\circ - x)\):
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ, \quad \cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \cos 55^\circ,

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""ellsipses,"" we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Count the total number of letters:**
   The word ""ellsipses"" consists of 9 letters.

2. **Identify the repeated letters:**
   In ""ellsipses,"" the letter 's' appears 3 times, and all other letters (e, l, i, p) appear exactly once.

3. **Use the formula for permutations of a multiset:**
   The formula to find the number of distinct permutations of a multiset (a set with repeated elements) is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

4. **Apply the formula:**
   For ""ellsipses"":
   - \( n = 9 \) (total letters)
   - \( n_1 = 3 \) (for the letter 's')
   - \( n_2 = 1 \) (for each of the letters 'e', 'l', 'i', 'p')

   Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
   \[
   \frac{9!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}

   - \( 9! = 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 362880 \)
   - \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
   - \( 1! = 1 \) (for each of the other letters)

6. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   \frac{362880}{6 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{362880}{6} = 60480

"To determine how many zeroes are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we need to count the number of pairs of the factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \(42!\).

First, we count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\). This is done by dividing 42 by 5 and then dividing the quotient by 5 again, and so on, until the quotient is less than 5.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum value might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
Now, we need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \).

To find the critical points of \( g(x) \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[ g'(x) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We also need to evaluate \( g(x) \) at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0, \]
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]

\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) can be found using the magnitude of the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), divided by 2. The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated as follows:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle in the complex plane, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The given equation can be rewritten using the exponential form of \( z \):

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Thus, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This implies:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Using the exponential form again, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we need to determine the angle \( \theta \). The value \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a specific cosine value that corresponds to a particular angle. However, we can use the fact that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation derived from the given equation. The quadratic equation is:

\[ z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0. \]

The roots of this equation are:

\[ z = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \pm \frac{\sqrt{2\sqrt{5} - 10}}{2}}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5} \pm \sqrt{2\sqrt{5} - 10}}{4}. \]

However, we can use the fact that \( z \) is a root of unity for some specific angle. The angle \( \theta \) is such that \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), and we need to find \( \cos(85\theta) \). By properties of roots of unity and the periodicity of the cosine function, we know that \( \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) \) because \( 85\theta \) is equivalent to \( 5\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \).

The value of \( \cos(5\theta) \) can be found using the multiple angle formula for cosine. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that \( z \) is a root of the equation and the periodicity of the cosine function. The value of \( \cos(5\theta) \) is the same as the value of \( \cos(\theta) \) because the cosine function is periodic with period \( 2\pi \) and the specific value of \( \cos\theta \) is such that \( \cos(5\theta) = \cos\theta \).

Thus, we have:

\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos(5\theta) = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) will intersect \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). This line creates a smaller triangle \( AMN \) that is similar to triangle \( ABC \) with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{1}{3} \) (since \( G \) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio and the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) creates a smaller triangle that is similar to \( ABC \) with the same ratio).

The area of triangle \( AMN \) is therefore \( \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} \) of the area of triangle \( ABC \). Since the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

The area of triangle \( Wthag \) is the area of triangle \( ABC \) minus the area of triangle \( AMN \) minus the area of the two other smaller triangles formed by the medians.

The area of triangle \( Wthag \) is the area of triangle \( ABC \) minus the area of triangle \( AMN \) minus the area of the two other smaller triangles formed by the medians. Since the area of triangle \( AMN \) is 16, and the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( Wthag \) is:
\[

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six primes, only the number 2 is even, and the rest (3, 5, 7, 11, and 13) are odd. Therefore, for the sum to be even, both Paul and Jesse must choose either the number 2 or one of the odd primes.

First, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes. Since each of Paul and Jesse can choose any one of the six primes, the total number of outcomes is:

Next, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:

"To determine the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line with the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are the coordinates of the point, we can replace \( x \) with \( a \) and \( y \) with \( b \). So the equation becomes:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the shaded triangles.

First, let's identify the vertices of the shaded triangles:
- The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the first shaded triangle
The first triangle is a right triangle with:
- Base along the x-axis from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
- Height along the y-axis from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a right triangle is given by:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the second shaded triangle
The second triangle is also a right triangle with:
- Base along the x-axis from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units.
- Height along the y-axis from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_2\) of this right triangle is:

A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6

### Step 3: Calculate the total area of the shaded region
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones, we need to consider the properties of 450. The number 450 can be factored into prime factors as follows:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 9 \times 25 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be a multiple of 2, 9, and 25. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Multiple of 2**: The number must end in 0.
2. **Multiple of 25**: The number must end in 00.
3. **Multiple of 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be a multiple of 9.

Since the number must end in 00, we can write it in the form \(100k\) where \(k\) is a number consisting of ones and zeros. The sum of the digits of \(k\) must be a multiple of 9. The smallest such \(k\) is 111111111 (九个一), because the sum of its digits is 9, which is a multiple of 9.

Therefore, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is:

\[ 100 \times 111111111 = 11111111100 \]

So, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones is:

"To determine the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of the two spins and identify which of these outcomes result in a shaded square.

First, let's identify the possible outcomes for each spin:
- The first spin can result in one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- The second spin can result in one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

We can represent the outcomes of the two spins as pairs \((a, b)\), where \(a\) is the result of the first spin and \(b\) is the result of the second spin. The total number of possible outcomes is \(6 \times 5 = 30\).

Next, we need to determine which of these outcomes correspond to a shaded square. The checkerboard is shaded in a specific pattern, and we can see that the shaded squares are at the following positions:
- (1, 1)
- (1, 3)
- (2, 2)
- (2, 4)

- (3, 3)
- (4, 2)

"To find the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to simplify the fraction and convert it to its decimal form.

The denominator of the fraction is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). We can rewrite this as \(2^7 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Therefore, the fraction can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]
This fraction is equivalent to moving the decimal point in 4321 to the left 7 places, then dividing by 2. So, we have:
\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00000021605
\]
The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is 0.00000021605. To find the sum of the digits in this decimal, we add the digits 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5:
\[

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) again to simplify \(\sin 120^\circ\) and \(\sin 160^\circ\):

\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). So the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\cos 10^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines and cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). This gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

So the original expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates:

- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) specifies that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This means that for any point \((r, \theta, z)\) on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and is located at a distance \( c \) above the \( xy \)-plane. This plane extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions, but it is fixed at \( z = c \).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying this equation, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, we choose \(\theta = 30^\circ\).

Thus, the smallest possible angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The function \( g(x) \) is defined as:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to consider the transformation \( x \to x + 5 \) in \( f(x) \). This transformation shifts the roots of \( f(x) \) to the left by 5 units.

First, let's find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). For a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by:
\[ -\frac{b}{a} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are:
\[ a = 1, \quad b = -49, \quad c = 623, \quad d = -2015 \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, consider the transformation \( x \to x + 5 \). This shift does not change the sum of the roots. Instead, it shifts each root by 5 units to the left. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

First, consider \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ.

Next, consider \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ}\):
\[

Finally, consider \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 50^\circ.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all but one of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the relationship between the sum of interior angles and the number of sides:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a convex polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = 180(n-2)
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(x\) be the measure of the one interior angle that is not included in the sum of \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, the sum of all interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + x
   \]
   According to the formula, this sum is also equal to \(180(n-2)\). So, we can write:
   \[
   1070 + x = 180(n-2)
   \]

3. **Express \(x\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We can rearrange the equation to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = 180(n-2) - 1070
   \]

4. **Determine the range for \(x\):**
   For \(x\) to be a valid interior angle, it must satisfy:
   \[
   0 < x < 180
   \]
   Substituting the expression for \(x\) into this inequality:
   \[
   0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
   \]

5. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the left part of the inequality:
   \[
   0 < 180(n-2) - 1070
   \]
   Add 1070 to both sides:
   \[
   1070 < 180(n-2)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   \frac{1070}{180} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round up to the next whole number:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the right part of the inequality:
   \[
   180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
   \]
   Add 1070 to both sides:
   \[
   180(n-2) < 1250
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

6. **Combine the results:**
   From the two inequalities, we have:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, \(n = 8\).

7. **Verify the solution:**
   If \(n = 8\), the sum of the interior angles of the polygon is:
   \[
   180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080^\circ
   \]
   If the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), then the measure of the missing angle is:
   \[
   1080 - 1070 = 10^\circ

Next, let's try \( t = 7 \):
\[ 7^2 + 2 \cdot 7 - 1 = 49 + 14 - 1 = 62 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}. \]

Next, let's try \( t = 9 \):
\[ 9^2 + 2 \cdot 9 - 1 = 81 + 18 - 1 = 98 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}. \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we compute the product of these two numbers:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This product is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse trigonometric functions. Specifically, we know that for any non-zero real number \(x\),

\[

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines, we start by identifying the direction vectors and a vector connecting a point on the first line to a point on the second line. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d_1} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d_2} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Notice that \(\mathbf{d_2} = 2 \mathbf{d_1}\), confirming that the lines are parallel.

Next, we need a vector \(\mathbf{v}\) that connects a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can use the points \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) from the respective lines. The vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is:
\[
\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The distance \(D\) between two parallel lines is given by the formula:
\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\|}{\|\mathbf{d_1}\|}.
\]

First, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):
\[
\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

\[
\|\mathbf{d_1}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, the distance \(D\) between the two lines is:
\[

1. **Identify the boundaries of the rectangle:**
   - The rectangle extends from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\).
   - The rectangle extends from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\).

2. **Determine the integer coordinates on the boundaries:**
   - For \(x = -5\), the integer \(y\) values are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\) (9 points).
   - For \(x = 5\), the integer \(y\) values are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\) (9 points).

3. **Calculate the total number of boundary points:**
   - Each side of the rectangle has 9 points, but the corners are counted twice. Therefore, we need to subtract the 4 corners:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, we have:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.

We know from the problem statement that:

\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}.

Substituting these into our expression, we get:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we know that \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). Additionally, \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). We are given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, and we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD = a\) and \(BC = b\), and the height of the trapezoid from \(B\) to \(AD\) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height of \(\triangle ACD\) is the same as the height of the trapezoid, which is \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42

\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h

To find \(a\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle BCD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\) and \(BC\) respectively, and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is proportional to the length of \(AD\) compared to \(BC\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both triangles and bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle BCD\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is exactly half the area of the trapezoid because the height is the same and the base \(AD\) is part of the total base sum \(a + b\).

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha \]

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\), we have:
\[ \cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \]
\[ \cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

Now we can substitute these values into the formulas for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \]
\[ \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \]

Now we need to find the product \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100} \]

We can simplify the numerator using the difference of squares formula:
\[ (2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21} - \sqrt{21} \cdot 2 \sqrt{3} = 2 \sqrt{63} - 4 \cdot 3 + 21 - 2 \sqrt{63} = 21 - 12 = 9 \]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[ \sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \frac{9}{100} \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To convert the bicycle's speed from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the speed from feet per minute to inches per minute.
2. Convert the speed from inches per minute to inches per second.

First, we know that there are 12 inches in a foot. Therefore, the bicycle's speed in inches per minute is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet per minute} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 240 \text{ inches per minute} \]

Next, we need to convert the speed from inches per minute to inches per second. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so we divide the speed in inches per minute by 60:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

The mean of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by their mean is 24. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Since \( n \neq 0 \), we can simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

\[

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**

   Subtract 4096 from both sides to set the equation to zero:

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

Since \(AM\) is the altitude, triangle \(ABM\) is a right triangle with \(AB\) as the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\).

We are given that point \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) with \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\), we can use the fact that \(\angle BDC\) is an external angle to triangle \(BDM\) at \(D\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle MDC\). Since \(\angle MDC = 90^\circ - \angle MBD = 90^\circ - \theta\), we have:
\[
3\theta = \angle BDM + 90^\circ - \theta.
\]
Solving for \(\angle BDM\), we get:
\[
\angle BDM = 4\theta - 90^\circ.
\]

Now, we use the Law of Sines in triangle \(BDM\):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin(90^\circ - \theta)} = \frac{DM}{\sin(4\theta - 90^\circ)}.
\]
Since \(\sin(90^\circ - \theta) = \cos \theta\) and \(\sin(4\theta - 90^\circ) = -\cos 4\theta\), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{-\cos 4\theta}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BD = -\frac{\cos \theta}{\cos 4\theta}.
\]

Next, we use the Law of Sines in triangle \(BDM\) again to find \(BD\):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{BM}{\sin(4\theta - 90^\circ)}.
\]
Since \(\sin(4\theta - 90^\circ) = -\cos 4\theta\), we have:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{x}{-\cos 4\theta}.
\]
Thus,
\[
BD = -\frac{x \sin \theta}{\cos 4\theta}.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(BD\), we get:
\[
-\frac{\cos \theta}{\cos 4\theta} = -\frac{x \sin \theta}{\cos 4\theta}.
\]
Simplifying, we find:
\[
\cos \theta = x \sin \theta.
\]
Thus,
\[
x = \cot \theta.
\]

Now, we use the Law of Cosines in triangle \(ABM\) to find \(\cos \theta\):
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 - 2 \cdot AM \cdot BM \cdot \cos \theta.
\]
Substituting \(AB = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\), \(AM = 11\), and \(BM = x\), we get:
\[
121 + x^2 = 11^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot 11 \cdot x \cdot \cos \theta.
\]
Simplifying, we find:
\[
121 = 121 - 22x \cos \theta.
\]
Thus,
\[
0 = -22x \cos \theta.
\]
Since \(x \neq 0\), we have:
\[
\cos \theta = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = 60^\circ\).

Finally, we find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\):
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + 2^2} = \sqrt{121 + 4} = \sqrt{125} = 5\sqrt{5}.

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[

First, let's consider the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\). Notice that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), so \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that the lower bound \(-4\) is automatically satisfied because \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than or equal to 0, which is greater than \(-4\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(x\) such that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can solve the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 = 21\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). This is a quadratic equation, which we can solve using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\).

Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7
\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives \(x = \pm \sqrt{3}\).

This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) when \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\). Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) for all real \(x\), the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]

We can use the identity for the sum of cubes:

\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:

\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:

\[4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),\]
\[-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).\]

Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:

\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).\]

Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:

\[x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.\]

Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:

\[-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).\]

The third given equation is:

\[xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.\]

We can factor this expression as:

\[xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(z + y) = xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.\]

So we have:

\[sp - 12 = 12,\]
\[sp = 24.\]

Now we have two equations:

2. \(sp = 24.\)

From the second equation, we can express \(s\) in terms of \(p\):

\[s = \frac{24}{p}.\]

\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \left( \frac{576}{p^2} - 3p \right),\]
\[-8 = \frac{24}{p} \cdot \frac{576 - 3p^3}{p^2},\]

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we need to analyze the given track configuration and use the provided information about the track's length.

The track consists of:
1. Two edges of the rectangular field.
2. Two semicircles, which together form a full circle.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the length of the rectangular field.
- \( W \) as the width of the rectangular field.
- \( r \) as the radius of the semicircles.

From the problem, we know:
- The total length of the track is 400 meters.

First, we express the total length of the track in terms of \( L \), \( W \), and \( r \):
- The two edges of the field contribute \( 2L \) to the track length.
- The two semicircles form a full circle with circumference \( 2\pi r \).

Thus, the total length of the track is:
\[
2L + 2\pi r = 400
\]

We can simplify this equation:
\[
L + \pi r = 200
\]

Next, we need to express the area \( A \) of the rectangular field in terms of \( L \) and \( W \):
\[
A = L \times W
\]

Since the width \( W \) of the field is equal to the diameter of the semicircles, we have:
\[
W = 2r
\]

Substitute \( W = 2r \) into the area formula:
\[
A = L \times 2r
\]

Now, we need to express \( r \) in terms of \( L \) using the track length equation:
\[
L + \pi r = 200
\]
\[
\pi r = 200 - L
\]
\[
r = \frac{200 - L}{\pi}
\]

Substitute \( r = \frac{200 - L}{\pi} \) into the area formula:
\[
A = L \times 2 \left( \frac{200 - L}{\pi} \right)
\]
\[
A = \frac{2L(200 - L)}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{400L - 2L^2}{\pi}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( L \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dL} = \frac{400 - 4L}{\pi}
\]
\[
0 = \frac{400 - 4L}{\pi}
\]
\[
400 - 4L = 0
\]
\[
4L = 400
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

Substitute \( L = 100 \) back into the equation for \( r \):
\[
r = \frac{200 - 100}{\pi}
\]
\[
r = \frac{100}{\pi}
\]

Now, calculate the width \( W \):
\[
W = 2r = 2 \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Finally, calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Thus, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle S\) is the right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles. Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]

We know that the sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Thus:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side \(RT\):
\[
RT^2 + ST^2 = RS^2
\]
\[
RT^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
\]
\[
RT^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2
\]
\[
RT^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2
\]
\[
RT^2 = 21k^2
\]
\[
RT = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). In \(\triangle RST\), \(\angle T\) is opposite side \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{5k}{k\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{21}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{21}\):
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{5}{\sqrt{21}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{\sqrt{21}} = \frac{5\sqrt{21}}{21}

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand the square term:

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we minimize \( D^2 \):

\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the expression becomes:

\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{2}u^2 - 2u + \frac{9}{2}
\]

This is a quadratic function in \( u \). To find the minimum value, we complete the square or use the vertex formula. The vertex of a quadratic function \( au^2 + bu + c \) occurs at \( u = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( b = -2 \):

\[
u = -\frac{-2}{2 \cdot \frac{1}{2}} = 2
\]

Substitute \( u = 2 \) back into the quadratic expression:

\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{2}(2)^2 - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 4 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

Thus, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The distance is expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2} \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). We need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( 3 - x = 0 \):
   \[
   x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Thus, the only solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). We need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x
   \]
   Set \( 3 - x = 6 \):
   \[
   x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x
   \]
   Set \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \):
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
   \]
   We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). We need to check if there are any other real roots in the domain \( x > 3 \). Since the polynomial is cubic and we have found one real root, we can use numerical methods or graphing to confirm there are no other real roots in the domain \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to use the property of a regular octahedron and the distances from a point \( P \) to its vertices. A regular octahedron can be inscribed in a cube such that each vertex of the octahedron is the midpoint of an edge of the cube. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) and the sixth vertex as \( G \).

Given the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( G \).

First, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. This is a known property of regular octahedra. Let \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6 \) be the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) respectively, and let \( d_7 \) be the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( G \).

The property states:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_7^2
\]

Given:
\[
d_1 = 3, \quad d_2 = 7, \quad d_3 = 8, \quad d_4 = 9, \quad d_5 = 11
\]

We need to find \( d_6 \) and \( d_7 \). Let:
\[
S = d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2
\]

Calculating \( S \):
\[
S = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2
\]
\[
S = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121
\]
\[
S = 324
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices is also 324, we have:
\[
S + d_6^2 = 324
\]
\[
324 + d_6^2 = 324
\]
\[
d_6^2 = 0
\]
\[
d_6 = 0
\]

This implies that the sixth vertex \( G \) is the same as one of the given vertices, which is not possible since \( G \) is a distinct vertex of the octahedron. Therefore, we must have made an error in our assumption. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

We use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point \( P \) to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant.

Using the property:
\[

"To solve the problem, we need to use the relationship between force, mass, and acceleration given by Newton's second law of motion, which states that force (\(F\)) is equal to mass (\(m\)) times acceleration (\(a\)). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Jen wants to throw a softball with the same force as Jack throws a baseball. Let's denote the force by \(F\), the mass of the softball by \(m_s = 200 \text{ g} = 0.2 \text{ kg}\), and the mass of the baseball by \(m_b = 150 \text{ g} = 0.15 \text{ kg}\). The acceleration of the softball is \(a_s\) and the acceleration of the baseball is \(a_b\).

Since the force is the same for both the softball and the baseball, we can write:

\[ F = m_s \cdot a_s = m_b \cdot a_b \]

We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball (the softball) to Jack's ball (the baseball), which is \(\frac{a_s}{a_b}\). From the equation above, we can express \(a_s\) in terms of \(a_b\):

\[ m_s \cdot a_s = m_b \cdot a_b \]
\[ a_s = \frac{m_b}{m_s} \cdot a_b \]

Substituting the masses of the softball and the baseball, we get:

\[ a_s = \frac{0.15 \text{ kg}}{0.2 \text{ kg}} \cdot a_b = \frac{15}{20} \cdot a_b = \frac{3}{4} \cdot a_b \]

"To determine how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 6\]
\[89 \div 7 = 12 \text{ remainder } 5\]
\[12 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 5\]
\[1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5\]
\[78 \div 8 = 9 \text{ remainder } 6\]
\[9 \div 8 = 1 \text{ remainder } 1\]
\[1 \div 8 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Compare the digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations.**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- The first digit of base 7 is 1, and the first digit of base 8 is 1.
- The second digit of base 7 is 5, and the second digit of base 8 is 1.
- The third digit of base 7 is 5, and the third digit of base 8 is 6.
- The fourth digit of base 7 is 6, and the fourth digit of base 8 is 5.

We see that the only digit that appears in both representations is the digit 1. Therefore, there is exactly one digit in common.

2. No handshakes occur between the girls themselves or between the sorcerers themselves.

Since each girl shakes hands with each of the 10 sorcerers, we can calculate the total number of handshakes by multiplying the number of girls by the number of sorcerers. This is because each of the 6 girls will shake hands with each of the 10 sorcerers exactly once.

The calculation is as follows:

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\[

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 + \alpha_1) + \alpha_3(\alpha_4 + \alpha_1 + \alpha_2) + \alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) - 3\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2 \cdot 0 - 3(-2) = 6.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 6.
\]

Next, we need to find the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(-2 + 0) = (-2)^2 + (-2)(-2) = 4 + 4 = 8.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 8.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 6\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 8\), the possible values for \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 6t^2 + 8t - 8 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots and find that \(t = 2\) is a root. Dividing the polynomial by \(t - 2\), we get:
\[
t^3 - 6t^2 + 8t - 8 = (t - 2)(t^2 - 4t + 4) = (t - 2)(t - 2)^2 = (t - 2)^3.
\]
Thus, the roots are \(2, 2, 2\), but since the roots are distinct, we need to consider the possibility of complex roots. However, the polynomial \(t^3 - 6t^2 + 8t - 8\) does not have three distinct real roots, so we need to consider the possibility of complex roots. The correct approach is to use the fact that the roots are distinct and the polynomial is symmetric, so the roots must be the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 6t^2 + 8t - 8 = 0\) in some order. The correct values are the roots of the polynomial, which are \(2, 2, 2\), but since the roots are distinct, we need to consider the possibility of complex roots. The correct values are the roots of the polynomial, which are \(2, 2, 2\), but since the roots are distinct, we need to consider the possibility of complex roots.

"To determine the cost of a pencil, we start by defining the variables for the cost of a pencil and the cost of a jumbo eraser. Let \( p \) be the cost of a pencil in cents and \( e \) be the cost of a jumbo eraser in cents. We can translate the given information into the following system of linear equations:

1. \( 3p + e = 124 \)
2. \( 5p + e = 182 \)

We can eliminate \( e \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

\[
(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 182 - 124
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
2p = 58
\]

Solving for \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
p = 29
\]

So, the cost of a pencil is \( 29 \) cents. To verify, we can substitute \( p = 29 \) back into the first equation to find \( e \):

\[
3(29) + e = 124
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
87 + e = 124
\]

Subtracting 87 from both sides, we find:

\[
e = 37
\]

So, the cost of a jumbo eraser is \( 37 \) cents. We can check our solution by substituting \( p = 29 \) and \( e = 37 \) into the second equation:

\[
5(29) + 37 = 145 + 37 = 182

The solution satisfies both equations, confirming that our solution is correct. Therefore, the cost of a pencil is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices. Let's start by understanding the geometry of the problem.

1. **Identify the center and the vertices:**
   - The center \(O\) of the rectangle is the midpoint of the diagonals.
   - The vertices of the rectangle are \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

2. **Determine the region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex:**
   - A point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if it lies inside the region formed by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting \(O\) to each vertex.
   - These perpendicular bisectors will form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as its center.

3. **Calculate the dimensions of the smaller rectangle:**
   - Since \(AB/AD = k\), let \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Then \(k = \frac{2a}{2b} = \frac{a}{b}\).
   - The perpendicular bisectors of \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\) will intersect at the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AD\), forming a smaller rectangle with side lengths \(a\) and \(b\).

4. **Calculate the area of the smaller rectangle:**

5. **Calculate the area of the original rectangle:**
   - The area of the original rectangle is \(2a \times 2b = 4ab\).

6. **Determine the probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle.

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at three different points: \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), \( \sqrt{45} \), and \( 8^{2/3} \). We will then sum the results.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047197 \).
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047197 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- We know that \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708 \).
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- We know that \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results:

Next, let's calculate the distance Jim walks. Jim walks diagonally across the rectangular field. The distance Jim walks is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal.

\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be travelled starting at any point and visiting the other three points once, we need to consider all possible routes and calculate the total distance for each. The points are labeled as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), and the distances between them are given as follows:

- \(AB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(BC = 6\)
- \(BD = 3\)
- \(CD = 4\)

We will evaluate the total distance for each possible route starting from each point and visiting the other three points exactly once.

### Starting at Point \(A\):
1. \(A \to B \to C \to D\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. \(A \to B \to D \to C\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 5 + 3 + 4 = 12
   \]
3. \(A \to C \to B \to D\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
   \]
4. \(A \to C \to D \to B\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
5. \(A \to D \to B \to C\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. \(A \to D \to C \to B\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 6 = 15
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \(A\) is 12.

### Starting at Point \(B\):
1. \(B \to A \to C \to D\):
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 5 + 6 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. \(B \to A \to D \to C\):
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 5 + 5 + 4 = 14
   \]
3. \(B \to C \to A \to D\):
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 6 + 6 + 5 = 17
   \]
4. \(B \to C \to D \to A\):
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15
   \]
5. \(B \to D \to A \to C\):
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. \(B \to D \to C \to A\):
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \(B\) is 13.

### Starting at Point \(C\):
1. \(C \to A \to B \to D\):
   \[
   CA + AB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
2. \(C \to A \to D \to B\):
   \[
   CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
3. \(C \to B \to A \to D\):
   \[
   CB + BA + AD = 6 + 5 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. \(C \to B \to D \to A\):
   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14
   \]
5. \(C \to D \to A \to B\):
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 5 = 14
   \]
6. \(C \to D \to B \to A\):
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 5 = 12
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \(C\) is 12.

### Starting at Point \(D\):
1. \(D \to A \to B \to C\):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 5 + 6 = 16
   \]
2. \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 6 = 17
   \]
3. \(D \to B \to A \to C\):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
4. \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
5. \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15
   \]
6. \(D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 6 + 5 = 15
   \]

The shortest distance starting at \(D\) is 14.
