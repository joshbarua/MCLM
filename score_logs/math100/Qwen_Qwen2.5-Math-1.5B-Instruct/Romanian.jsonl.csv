"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We are given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(D\) as \(EF\) and the hypotenuse as \(DE\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(DE\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]
Dividing both sides by 0.7 gives:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) that results from rotating \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise around \( c = 2 - 3i \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

First, let's factorize 242:
- 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
  \[
  242 \div 2 = 121
  \]
  So, we have:
  \[
  242 = 2 \times 121
  \]

Next, we factorize 121:
- 121 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3.
- 121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
- Let's check if 121 is divisible by 7:
  \[
  121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad (\text{not an integer})
  \]
  So, 121 is not divisible by 7.
- Let's check if 121 is divisible by 11:
  \[
  121 \div 11 = 11
  \]
  So, we have:
  \[
  121 = 11 \times 11
  \]

Now, we can write the complete factorization of 242:
\[
242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11
\]

Next, we simplify the square root:
\[
\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}
\]

We can take the square root of the perfect square \(11 \times 11\):
\[
\sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}
\]

Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can each take one of the 8 golf balls, we need to consider the following:

1. There are 8 golf balls.
2. Each of the 3 players (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas) will take one golf ball.
3. The order in which the golf balls are taken does not matter, only which golf balls each player takes.

This is a problem of choosing 3 golf balls out of 8, where the order of selection does not matter. This is a combination problem, specifically ""8 choose 3"", which is denoted as \( \binom{8}{3} \).

The formula for combinations is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 8 \) and \( r = 3 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\binom{8}{3} = \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} = \frac{8!}{3!5!}
\]

Next, we calculate the factorials:
\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320
\]
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Now, substitute these values back into the combination formula:
\[
\binom{8}{3} = \frac{40320}{6 \times 120} = \frac{40320}{720} = 56
\]

Therefore, the number of ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can each take one of the 8 golf balls is \(\boxed{56}\).","[56, '56']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression for \(T_k\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15-5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate \(\binom{5}{3}\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute \(\binom{5}{3}\) back into the expression:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[

"To solve the problem, we start with the given condition that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \). This means that \( n \) can be written in the form \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \). We need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

Since we are interested in the remainder when this product is divided by 7, we can simplify each term modulo 7:

\[
7k + 4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
7k + 8 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 becomes:

\[
(7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Now, calculate the product \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1\):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

\[
24 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \cdot 1 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometry of a regular pentagon and its properties. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is inscribed in a circle, the central angle subtended by each side of the pentagon is \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

The problem asks for the smallest number of degrees that must be rotated so that the pentagon coincides with its original position. This is equivalent to finding the smallest angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself. This angle is the same as the central angle subtended by one side of the pentagon, which is \(72^\circ\).

Therefore, the smallest number of degrees that must be rotated so that the pentagon coincides with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices: \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\). We are also given that \(x > 7\).

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, meaning the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we set them equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Since \(x = 6\) does not satisfy this condition, we need to consider the possibility that the vertices are labeled differently. Let's try another configuration where \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(7, 4)\), \(C(6, 8)\), and \(D(x, y)\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:

The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:

\]

Setting the midpoints equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7 + x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4 + y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

Since \(x = 4\) does not satisfy \(x > 7\), we need to consider the possibility that the vertices are labeled differently again. Let's try the configuration where \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\) again but with a different approach.

The correct configuration is where the vertices are \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(7, 4)\), \(C(6, 8)\), and \(D(x, y)\).

The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)

The midpoint of diagonal \(BD\) is:
\[

"To determine \(\tan A\) in the right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the definitions of sine and cosine in a right triangle:**
   \[
   \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can write:
   \[
   \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   \text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the hypotenuse:**
   Let the length of the adjacent side be \(x\). Then the length of the opposite side is \(2x\). The hypotenuse \(h\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
   \[
   h = \sqrt{x^2 + (2x)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4x^2} = \sqrt{5x^2} = x\sqrt{5}

3. **Determine \(\tan A\):**
   The tangent of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the adjacent side:

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We need to solve the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. We do this by comparing the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.
   - The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1.
   - The degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

   Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these together gives:
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) and express the result in minutes, we can use a mathematical trick. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to compute. Specifically, we can recognize that this expression is a special case of the binomial expansion for \((a+1)^2\), where \(a = 99\).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The characteristic polynomial of \( A^T A \) is given by:
\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\).

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the result in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, we subtract the two base 10 numbers:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide the number by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Therefore, the result of \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9 is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]
Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.

So, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, let's define the greunties of the squig and the goolee as follows:
- Let \( S \) be the greundie of one squig.
- Let \( G \) be the greundie of one goolee.

The problem states that if Zecie trees three squigs and one goolee, the total greundie is equal to the greundie of two squigs and one goolee, and also equal to the greundie of one squig. We can express this information with the following equations:

1. \( 3S + G = 2S + G \)
2. \( 3S + G = S \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ 3S + G = 2S + G \]
Subtract \( 2S + G \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + G - 2S - G = 0 \]
\[ S = 0 \]

This result tells us that the greundie of one squig is zero. However, this seems to be a contradiction because it implies that the squig has no greundie, which is not a typical interpretation of the problem. Let's re-evaluate the problem with the second equation:

\[ 3S + G = S \]
Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + G - S = 0 \]
\[ 2S + G = 0 \]
\[ G = -2S \]

This tells us that the greundie of one goolee is equal to the negative of twice the greundie of one squig. Now, we need to find the ratio of the greundie of the combination of three squigs and one goolee to the greundie of one squig. The greundie of the combination of three squigs and one goolee is:
\[ 3S + G = 3S - 2S = S \]

The greundie of one squig is \( S \). Therefore, the ratio of the greundie of the combination of three squigs and one goolee to the greundie of one squig is:
\[ \frac{S}{S} = 1 \]

Thus, the greundie of the combination of three squigs and one goolee is equal to the greundie of one squig. The answer is:

First, let's write down the given polynomials and their sum:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a) + (4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6

Combine the like terms from the left-hand side:
\[

\]
\[
7t^2 + (5 + b)t + (a - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

Now, we compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both sides of the equation:

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) on the left-hand side is 0, and on the right-hand side is 12. This indicates there is no \(t^4\) term in the sum of the given polynomials, so there must be an error in the problem statement or interpretation. However, we will proceed with the assumption that the problem is correctly stated and focus on the other terms.

2. The coefficient of \(t^3\) on the left-hand side is 0, and on the right-hand side is 26. This indicates there is no \(t^3\) term in the sum of the given polynomials, so there must be an error in the problem statement or interpretation. However, we will proceed with the assumption that the problem is correctly stated and focus on the other terms.

3. The coefficient of \(t^2\) on the left-hand side is 7, and on the right-hand side is -8. This gives us:
\[
7 = -8
\]
This is a contradiction, indicating there is an error in the problem statement or interpretation. However, we will proceed with the assumption that the problem is correctly stated and focus on the other terms.

4. The coefficient of \(t\) on the left-hand side is \(5 + b\), and on the right-hand side is -16. This gives us:
\[
5 + b = -16
\]
Solving for \(b\):
\[
b = -16 - 5
\]
\[
b = -21

Solving for \(a\):
\[
a = 6 + 2

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the water level rises and the volume of water added per hour.

First, let's denote the radius of the cylindrical tank by \( r \) meters. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( h \) is the height of the water in the cylinder.

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. Additionally, the water level rises at a rate of 2 meters per hour. This means that the volume of water added per hour is also equal to the cross-sectional area of the cylinder (which is \( \pi r^2 \)) multiplied by the rate at which the water level rises (which is 2 meters per hour). Therefore, we can write:
\[ \pi r^2 \cdot 2 = 20\pi \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 2\pi \):
\[ r^2 = 10 \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every line of the form \(y = mx + c\) at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) and the conditions under which it can intersect any line.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
\[
f(a) = a^2.
\]

For \(f(x)\) to intersect every line \(y = mx + c\), it must be able to take on any value in the range of the line. This means that the function \(f(x)\) must be able to take on any value in the range of the line \(y = mx + c\).

The function \(f(x)\) is a piecewise function. For \(x \geq a\), \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards, and for \(x < a\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a line with a slope of \(a\).

To ensure that \(f(x)\) can intersect every line \(y = mx + c\), we need to check the behavior of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(\pm \infty\).

1. As \(x \to \infty\), \(f(x) = ax^2\) grows without bound if \(a > 0\).
2. As \(x \to -\infty\), \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) grows without bound if \(a > 0\).

For \(a \leq 0\), the function \(f(x)\) is either a line or a parabola that opens downwards, and it does not cover all possible values of \(y = mx + c\). Therefore, \(a\) must be positive.

Next, we need to ensure that \(f(x)\) can take on any value in the range of the line \(y = mx + c\). This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(y = mx + c\).

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\), where \(f(a) = a^2\). For \(f(x)\) to intersect every line \(y = mx + c\), \(a^2\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(y = mx + c\).

Since \(y = mx + c\) can take on any value, the minimum value of \(y = mx + c\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, \(a^2\) must be less than or equal to \(-\infty\), which is not possible.

However, we need to ensure that \(f(x)\) can take on any value in the range of the line \(y = mx + c\) for all \(x\). This means that the minimum value of \(f(x)\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(y = mx + c\).

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\), where \(f(a) = a^2\). For \(f(x)\) to intersect every line \(y = mx + c\), \(a^2\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of \(y = mx + c\).

Since \(y = mx + c\) can take on any value, the minimum value of \(y = mx + c\) is \(-\infty\). Therefore, \(a^2\) must be less than or equal to \(-\infty\), which is not possible.

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a circumference of 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Rewrite the equation in standard form:**
   The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.

2. **Complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms:**
   - For the \(x\) terms: \(x^2 - 10x\)

     x^2 - 10x = (x - 5)^2 - 25

   - For the \(y\) terms: \(y^2 + 6y\)

3. **Substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:**

5. **Isolate the completed square terms:**
   \[

6. **Identify the radius \(r\):**
   The equation \((x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c\) represents a circle with radius \(r\) where \(r^2 = 34 - c\).

7. **Use the circumference to find the radius:**
   The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by \(C = 2\pi r\). We are given that the circumference is 1:
   \[
   1 = 2\pi r

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The second solution \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is valid only if it lies in the interval \([0,1]\). This means:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
The left inequality is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\). The right inequality gives:
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0,
\]
which is always true. Therefore, the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is valid for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then \(f(f(0)) = 0\), which is true. If \(x = 1\), then \(f(f(1)) = 0\), which is not equal to 1. For \(x \in (0,1)\), we can divide both sides by \(x\) (since \(x \neq 0\)):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We need to check if this equation has solutions for \(x \in (0,1)\) and \(\lambda \in [0,4]\). Let's consider the case when \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda - 1.
\]
We need to check if \(f(f(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda})) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\):
\[
f(f(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda})) = f(\lambda - 1) = \lambda (\lambda - 1)(1 - (\lambda - 1)) = \lambda (\lambda - 1)(2 - \lambda).
\]
We need:
\[
\lambda (\lambda - 1)(2 - \lambda) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
If \(\lambda - 1 = 0\), then \(\lambda = 1\). For \(\lambda = 1\), we have:
\[
f(x) = x(1 - x),
\]
and
\[
f(f(x)) = f(x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x + x^2) = x.
\]
So, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), and there is no \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, \(\lambda = 1\) is not a solution.

For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we need to check if there are any other values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition. By analyzing the function, we find that for \(\lambda \in (1,4]\), there are values of \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\) are:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Notice that:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ.
\]
However, we can simplify this further by recognizing that:
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ,
\]
and
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos 25^\circ.
\]
So the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine. Notice that:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
and
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -\sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ = -\cos 5^\circ.
\]
Thus, the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

So, we need to count the number of times the prime factors 2, 3, and 7 appear in the factorization of \(42!\), and then take the minimum of these counts, because each 42 is composed of one 2, one 3, and one 7.

\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We also need to check the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

Evaluating \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]

The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1, which occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is also 1, and it is achieved when \( x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\) with given vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\) in 3D space, which is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \|
\]

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component, we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

Finally, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Thus, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The given equation can be rewritten using the exponential form of \( z \):

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

So, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This implies:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we need to determine the angle \( \theta \). The value \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a specific value that corresponds to a particular angle. However, we can use the fact that \( \cos(85\theta) \) will be the same as \( \cos\theta \) because \( \cos \) is periodic with period \( 2\pi \). Specifically, since \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \), we have:

\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Thus,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of the centroid and the concept of similar triangles. Let's go through the solution step by step.

1. **Identify the Centroid and its Properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( G \) divides each median into segments such that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

2. **Use the Property of Similar Triangles:**
   Since \( G \) is the centroid, the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) will intersect \( AB \) and \( AC \) at points \( M \) and \( N \) respectively, such that \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) with a similarity ratio of \( \frac{2}{3} \). This is because the centroid divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area, and the line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) creates a smaller triangle \( AMN \) that is similar to \( ABC \) with a ratio of \( \frac{2}{3} \).

3. **Calculate the Area of \( \triangle AMN \):**
   Since the similarity ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \), the area ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \). Therefore, the area of \( \triangle AMN \) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

"To find the 18th term of the arithmetic sequence, we need to determine the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\). We are given that the 5th term is 200 and the 8th term is 500. The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:

\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

Using the information given, we can write two equations:

1. For the 5th term:
\[a + 4d = 200\]

2. For the 8th term:
\[a + 7d = 500\]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(a\):

\[(a + 7d) - (a + 4d) = 500 - 200\]
\[3d = 300\]
\[d = 100\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):

\[a + 4(100) = 200\]
\[a + 400 = 200\]
\[a = 200 - 400\]
\[a = -200\]

\[a_{18} = a + (18-1)d\]
\[a_{18} = -200 + 17 \cdot 100\]

"To solve the problem, we need to find a positive integer that has exactly 20 factors and is a divisor of both 100 and 150. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the prime factorizations of 100 and 150
The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \]

### Step 2: Identify the common divisors of 100 and 150
The common divisors of 100 and 150 are the divisors of their greatest common divisor (gcd). The gcd of 100 and 150 is:
\[ \gcd(100, 150) = 2 \times 5^2 = 50 \]

The divisors of 50 are:
\[ 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50 \]

### Step 3: Check which of these divisors have exactly 20 factors
We need to check the number of factors of each of these divisors.

- The number of factors of 1 is \(1\).
- The number of factors of 2 is \(2\).
- The number of factors of 5 is \(2\).
- The number of factors of 10 is \(4\).
- The number of factors of 25 is \(3\).
- The number of factors of 50 is \(6\).

None of these numbers have exactly 20 factors. Therefore, we need to consider the general form of a number with exactly 20 factors. A number \( n \) with the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \) has \((e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)\) factors. We need this product to be 20. The possible factorizations of 20 are:
\[ 20 = 20 \times 1 \]
\[ 20 = 10 \times 2 \]
\[ 20 = 5 \times 4 \]
\[ 20 = 5 \times 2 \times 2 \]

"To determine if \(2^{24}\) is a perfect \(n\)-th power for some integer \(n > 1\), we need to express \(2^{24}\) in the form \(k^n\) where \(k\) is an integer. This means that \(24\) must be divisible by \(n\), because the exponent in the prime factorization of a perfect \(n\)-th power must be a multiple of \(n\).

First, we list the divisors of \(24\):
\[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\]

Since \(n > 1\), we exclude \(1\) from the list. Therefore, the possible values for \(n\) are:
\[2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24\]

We will check each of these values to see if \(2^{24}\) can be written as \(k^n\) for some integer \(k\):

1. For \(n = 2\):
   \[2^{24} = (2^{12})^2\]
   So, \(2^{24}\) is a perfect 2nd power.

2. For \(n = 3\):

3. For \(n = 4\):
   \[2^{24} = (2^6)^4\]
   So, \(2^{24}\) is a perfect 4th power.

4. For \(n = 6\):
   \[2^{24} = (2^4)^6\]
   So, \(2^{24}\) is a perfect 6th power.

5. For \(n = 8\):
   \[2^{24} = (2^3)^8\]
   So, \(2^{24}\) is a perfect 8th power.

6. For \(n = 12\):
   \[2^{24} = (2^2)^{12}\]
   So, \(2^{24}\) is a perfect 12th power.

7. For \(n = 24\):
   \[2^{24} = (2^1)^{24}\]

"To determine how many coins of 5 farthings are in the total of 75 farthings, we can follow these steps:

1. Let \( x \) be the number of coins of 10 farthings.
2. Let \( y \) be the number of coins of 5 farthings.
3. We know that the total value of the coins is 75 farthings. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   10x + 5y = 75
   \]
4. We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
   \[
   2x + y = 15
   \]
5. To find the number of coins of 5 farthings, we need to express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 15 - 2x
   \]
6. Since \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find values of \( x \) that make \( y \) a non-negative integer. Let's test possible values for \( x \):
   - If \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(0) = 15 \).
   - If \( x = 1 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(1) = 13 \).
   - If \( x = 2 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(2) = 11 \).
   - If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(3) = 9 \).
   - If \( x = 4 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(4) = 7 \).
   - If \( x = 5 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(5) = 5 \).
   - If \( x = 6 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(6) = 3 \).
   - If \( x = 7 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(7) = 1 \).
   - If \( x = 8 \), then \( y = 15 - 2(8) = -1 \) (which is not a non-negative integer).

So, the possible values for \( y \) are 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1. However, without additional information, we cannot determine a unique value for \( y \).

"To determine the probability that the sum of two prime numbers chosen from the first six prime numbers is even, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the first six prime numbers.
2. Determine the total number of ways to choose two prime numbers from these six.
3. Determine the number of ways to choose two prime numbers such that their sum is even.
4. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

**Step 1: Identify the first six prime numbers.**

The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

**Step 2: Determine the total number of ways to choose two prime numbers from these six.**

The number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \).

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 possible ways to choose 2 prime numbers from the first six prime numbers.

**Step 3: Determine the number of ways to choose two prime numbers such that their sum is even.**

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Since there is only one even prime number (2), the only way to get an even sum is to choose two odd prime numbers. The odd prime numbers from the first six are: 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. There are 5 odd prime numbers.

The number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 5 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 2 \).

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

So, there are 10 ways to choose 2 odd prime numbers from the first six prime numbers, which means there are 10 ways to choose 2 prime numbers such that their sum is even.

**Step 4: Calculate the probability.**

The probability that the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}\).","[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \). Since \( a \) and \( b \) are the coordinates of the point, we can replace \( x \) with \( a \) and \( y \) with \( b \). So the equation becomes:

The vertices of the quadrilateral are at points \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((0, 0)\). We can divide this quadrilateral into two triangles: one with vertices \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\), and the other with vertices \((0, 4)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((0, 0)\).

First, let's calculate the area of the triangle with vertices \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units. The area of a triangle is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}

So, the area of this triangle is:

\[

Next, let's calculate the area of the triangle with vertices \((0, 4)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((0, 0)\). This is also a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units. Using the same area formula, the area of this triangle is:

\[
\text{Area}_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

The total area of the concave quadrilateral is the sum of the areas of these two triangles:

"To determine the probability that the piece will end up on the black square of the chessboard, we need to analyze the process step by step.

1. **Identify the initial conditions and the process:**
   - The chessboard has 64 squares, half of which are black and half are white.
   - The first number is chosen by dividing a number by 4 and taking the remainder (1, 2, or 3). This means the first number can be either 1, 2, or 3, each with a probability of \(\frac{1}{3}\).
   - The second number is chosen by dividing a number by 5 and taking the remainder (1, 2, 3, or 4). This means the second number can be either 1, 2, 3, or 4, each with a probability of \(\frac{1}{4}\).

2. **Determine the probability of landing on a black square:**
   - The first number (remainder when divided by 4) can be 1, 2, or 3. If the first number is 1 or 3, the piece will be on a black square after the first move (since the first move is from a white square to a black square or vice versa). If the first number is 2, the piece will be on a white square after the first move.
   - The second number (remainder when divided by 5) can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the second number is 1 or 3, the piece will be on a black square after the second move. If the second number is 2 or 4, the piece will be on a white square after the second move.
   - The probability that the first number is 1 or 3 is \(\frac{2}{3}\), and the probability that the second number is 1 or 3 is \(\frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the probability that the piece lands on a black square after both moves is \(\frac{2}{3} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{3}\).

   We can rewrite this as:
   \[
   5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ

(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ)

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ)

Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to express \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). However, we can also use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines. The product of sines can be simplified using the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression.

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Let \( y = x + 5 \). Then:

The roots of \( f(y) = 0 \) are the same as the roots of \( f(x) = 0 \). Let the roots of \( f(x) = 0 \) be \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). Therefore, the roots of \( f(y) = 0 \) are also \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \).

Since \( y = x + 5 \), the roots of \( g(x) = 0 \) are:
\[ x = r_1 - 5, \quad x = r_2 - 5, \quad x = r_3 - 5 \]

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \frac{1}{\cos^2 50^\circ}.

\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2},
\]
\[
\sin^2 40^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 80^\circ}{2}.

So the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + \frac{2}{1 - \cos 80^\circ}.

We can use the identity \(\cos 80^\circ = \sin 10^\circ\) and \(\cos 40^\circ = \sin 50^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to use the identity for the sum of the squares of the sine and cosine of complementary angles:

This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We need to solve this quadratic congruence. First, we use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

So, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 22 to find such an \( x \):

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution, and thus \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. We need to check which of these values satisfy the original condition. For \( t = 4 \):

\[ t + 2 = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( t = 4 \) works. For \( t = 17 \):

\[ t + 2 = 19 \quad \text{and} \quad 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( t = 17 \) also works. Therefore, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since the problem asks for the value of \( t \), and both values are valid, we can choose either one. Conventionally, we would present the smallest positive solution, which is 4.

"To determine the side length of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic meter, we start with the formula for the volume of a cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:

\[ V = s^3 \]

We know that the volume of the cube is 1 cubic meter, so we can set up the equation:

\[ s^3 = 1 \]

To find the side length \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides of the equation:

\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} \]

The cube root of 1 is 1, so the side length of the cube is:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

This expression is in the form of a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Calculating the squares, we have:

\[

2. Subtract 1 from \( f(5) \).

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function \( f \):

\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using the identity for the sum of the inverse trigonometric functions. Specifically, we know that for any non-zero real number \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This means the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, so the lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find the distance between these two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines given by \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t \mathbf{b}_1\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u \mathbf{b}_2\) is given by the formula:

Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[ \mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)) \]

\[ = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) \]

"To determine which points lie strictly inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to analyze the coordinates of each point in relation to the boundaries of the rectangle.

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) and has a width of 10 units and a height of 8 units. Therefore, any point \((x,y)\) that lies strictly inside the rectangle must satisfy the following conditions:
\[
-5 < x < 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 < y < 4
\]

Let's check each point given in the problem:

1. \((3, 2)\):
   - \(x = 3\) and \(y = 2\)
   - \( -5 < 3 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < 2 < 4 \) (True)
   - Therefore, \((3, 2)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle.

2. \((-3, -2)\):
   - \(x = -3\) and \(y = -2\)
   - \( -5 < -3 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < -2 < 4 \) (True)
   - Therefore, \((-3, -2)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle.

3. \((0, 0)\):
   - \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\)
   - \( -5 < 0 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < 0 < 4 \) (True)
   - Therefore, \((0, 0)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle.

4. \((5, 4)\):
   - \(x = 5\) and \(y = 4\)
   - \( -5 < 5 < 5 \) (False)
   - Therefore, \((5, 4)\) does not lie strictly inside the rectangle.

5. \((-5, -4)\):
   - \(x = -5\) and \(y = -4\)
   - \( -5 < -5 < 5 \) (False)
   - Therefore, \((-5, -4)\) does not lie strictly inside the rectangle.

6. \((0, 0)\):
   - \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\)
   - \( -5 < 0 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < 0 < 4 \) (True)
   - Therefore, \((0, 0)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle.

7. \((3, -2)\):
   - \(x = 3\) and \(y = -2\)
   - \( -5 < 3 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < -2 < 4 \) (False)
   - Therefore, \((3, -2)\) does not lie strictly inside the rectangle.

8. \((-3, 2)\):
   - \(x = -3\) and \(y = 2\)
   - \( -5 < -3 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < 2 < 4 \) (True)
   - Therefore, \((-3, 2)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle.

9. \((0, 0)\):
   - \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\)
   - \( -5 < 0 < 5 \) (True)
   - \( -4 < 0 < 4 \) (True)
   - Therefore, \((0, 0)\) lies strictly inside the rectangle.

10. \((5, 4)\):
    - \(x = 5\) and \(y = 4\)
    - \( -5 < 5 < 5 \) (False)
    - Therefore, \((5, 4)\) does not lie strictly inside the rectangle.

After checking all the points, the points that lie strictly inside the rectangle are:
\[
(3, 2), (-3, -2), (0, 0), (0, 0), (-3, 2)

However, since \((0, 0)\) is listed twice, we only count it once. Therefore, the final list of points that lie strictly inside the rectangle is:
\[
(3, 2), (-3, -2), (0, 0), (-3, 2)
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

We know from the problem statement that:

\[

\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

Adding these vectors together, we get:

2. Calculate the total number of items sold in the 70's.
3. Divide the total number of items sold in the 70's by the number of years in the 70's to find the average.

From the table, we can see the following data for the 70's:

- 12 items sold in 1971
- 6 items sold in 1972

1. **Identify the properties and relationships:**
   - Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), \( \angle BAC = \angle CAD \).
   - Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
   - Let \( \angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BAD = 2\theta \).

2. **Express the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\):**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h

   where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is the same as the length of \(AC\) because \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \).

   The area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) is:
   \[
   [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h
   \]
   Since \(h = AC\), we can substitute \(h\) with \(AC\).

4. **Relate the areas:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):
   \[
   [ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]

   Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \triangle ACD \) is a right triangle with area:
   \[
   [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC

   And since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), \( \triangle ABC \) is also a right triangle with area:
   \[
   [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC

   Therefore, the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be written as:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC + \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (AD + BC)
   \]
   Given that \( [ABCD] = 42 \), we have:
   \[
   42 = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (AD + BC)

   Since \( [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC \), we can express \( [\triangle ACD] \) in terms of \( [ABCD] \):
   \[
   [\triangle ACD] = \frac{AD}{AD + BC} \times 42
   \]
   But since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), the ratio \( \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{AB}{BC} \) and because \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), the height \(h = AC\) is the same for both triangles. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the area of the trapezoid because \( \overline{AC} \) is the height and it splits the trapezoid into two equal areas when considering the right triangle properties and the angle bisector.

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) chosen randomly on its circumference.
   - We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.
   - This means that if we list the points in the order they appear when moving around the circle, the sequence must be either \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations).

3. **Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**
   - There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence.
   - Out of these 24 arrangements, only 8 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) given the information about the areas of the circles and the segments.

Let's denote the radius of the larger circle as \( R \) and the radius of the smaller circle as \( r \). The area of the larger circle is \( \pi R^2 \) and the area of the smaller circle is \( \pi r^2 \).

The problem states that the area of the smaller circle is \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\pi r^2 = \frac{5}{12} \pi R^2
\]
By canceling \( \pi \) from both sides, we get:
\[
r^2 = \frac{5}{12} R^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:
\[
r = \sqrt{\frac{5}{12}} R = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2\sqrt{3}} R = \frac{\sqrt{15}}{6} R
\]

Now, let's consider the geometry of the problem. The smaller circle is inscribed in the larger circle such that it touches the larger circle at one point and the line segment \( AD \) is a diameter of the smaller circle. This means that the distance from the center of the larger circle to the center of the smaller circle is \( R - r \).

Since \( AD \) is a diameter of the smaller circle, the length of \( AD \) is \( 2r \). The angle \( \angle ADC \) is the angle subtended by the diameter \( AD \) at the point \( C \), which is the center of the larger circle. The angle subtended by a diameter at any point on the circumference of a circle is always \( 90^\circ \).

Therefore, the measure of angle \( \angle ADC \) is:

"To determine how many spherical marbles are needed to fill a cylindrical container, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical container and the spherical marbles, and then find the ratio of the volume of the cylinder to the volume of one sphere.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical container. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. Given that the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of one spherical marble. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Given that the radius \( r \) is 6 cm, we can substitute this value into the formula:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, to find out how many spherical marbles are needed to fill the cylindrical container, we divide the volume of the cylinder by the volume of one sphere:
\[ \text{Number of marbles} = \frac{V_{\text{cylinder}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{72\pi}{288\pi} = \frac{72}{288} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Since we cannot have a fraction of a marble, we need to consider the practical scenario where we would need to fill the cylinder completely. Therefore, we need to round up to the next whole number. However, the problem asks for the exact number of marbles needed to fill the cylinder, which is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of a marble. Since we cannot have a fraction of a marble in a physical sense, the correct interpretation in this context is that we need 4 times the volume of the marbles to fill the cylinder completely.

Thus, the number of spherical marbles needed to fill the cylindrical container is:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these two sine values:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9

"To determine the speed of the bicycles in inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the distance covered in decimal form.
2. Convert the distance from decimeters to inches.
3. Determine the time taken in seconds.
4. Calculate the speed in inches per second.

Let's start with the given information:
- The distance covered is 20 decimeters.
- The time taken is 10 seconds.

First, we convert the distance from decimeters to inches. We know that 1 decimeter is equal to 3.937 inches. Therefore, 20 decimeters is equal to:
\[ 20 \text{ decimeters} \times 3.937 \text{ inches/decimeter} = 78.74 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we know the time taken is 10 seconds. To find the speed in inches per second, we divide the distance by the time:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomit of 5 members from a group of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, we need to calculate the number of combinations of 14 people taken 5 at a time. This is because the order in which we choose the members does not matter.

The formula for combinations is given by:
\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]
where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 14 \) and \( r = 5 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}
\]

Next, we simplify the factorials. The factorial \( 14! \) (14 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 14, and \( 9! \) (9 factorial) is the product of all positive integers from 1 to 9. We can cancel out the \( 9! \) in the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{5! \times 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5!}
\]

Now, we need to calculate \( 5! \) (5 factorial):
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{120}

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the sum of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[

Solving for \( n \), we divide both sides by 3:
\[
n = 40

So, the three consecutive integers are \( 39 \), \( 40 \), and \( 41 \).

Next, we need to verify that the product of these three integers, when divided by their sum, gives the mean of the three integers, which is 24. The sum of the three integers is 120, and the product is:
\[

Calculating the product step-by-step:
\[

"To determine the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\). Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

Solving these two equations gives us:

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), and \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Then, \(BC = 2x\).

In triangle \(ABM\), we have:
\[AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}.\]

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we can use the fact that \(\angle BDC\) is an external angle to triangle \(BDM\) at \(D\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle MDC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\), and \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \angle BAC = 90^\circ - \theta\). Let \(\angle MDC = \alpha\). Then, we have:
\[3\theta = 90^\circ - \theta + \alpha \implies \alpha = 4\theta - 90^\circ.\]

Now, consider triangle \(BDM\). Since \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta\) and \(\angle BMD = 90^\circ\), we have:
\[\angle BDM + \angle BMD + \angle MBD = 180^\circ \implies (90^\circ - \theta) + 90^\circ + \angle MBD = 180^\circ \implies \angle MBD = \theta.\]

Since \(\angle MBD = \theta\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\), we can use the Law of Sines in triangle \(BDM\):
\[\frac{BD}{\sin \theta} = \frac{BM}{\sin (45^\circ - \theta)}.\]

Since \(BD = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we have:
\[\frac{1}{\sin \theta} = \frac{x}{\sin (45^\circ - \theta)} \implies \sin (45^\circ - \theta) = x \sin \theta.\]

Using the angle subtraction formula for sine, we get:
\[\sin (45^\circ - \theta) = \sin 45^\circ \cos \theta - \cos 45^\circ \sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos \theta - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos \theta - \sin \theta).\]

Therefore, we have:
\[\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos \theta - \sin \theta) = x \sin \theta \implies \cos \theta - \sin \theta = x \sqrt{2} \sin \theta \implies x = \frac{\cos \theta - \sin \theta}{\sqrt{2} \sin \theta} = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sqrt{2} \sin \theta} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\cot \theta}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.\]

Since \(x = \frac{11}{2}\), we have:
\[\frac{\cot \theta}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{11}{2} \implies \cot \theta = \frac{11\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{12\sqrt{2}}{2} = 6\sqrt{2} \implies \theta = \arccot (6\sqrt{2}).\]

"To determine the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sum of the integers:**
   The sum of the 27 consecutive integers is given as \(3^7\). First, calculate \(3^7\):
   \[
   3^7 = 2187

2. **Determine the median of the integers:**
   The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th number in the sequence (since the median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number). Let's denote the first integer in the sequence by \(a\). The 27 consecutive integers can be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

3. **Express the sum in terms of \(a\):**
   The sum of these 27 integers can be written as:
   \[
   a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)
   \]
   This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\) and the last term \(a+26\). The sum of an arithmetic series is given by:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})

   Here, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a+26\). So the sum is:
   \[
   \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)

   We know this sum is equal to 2187, so:
   \[
   27 \times (a + 13) = 2187

   Solving for \(a\):
   \[
   a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

   a = 81 - 13 = 68

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2.\]
We can complete the square for the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\):
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4.\]
This transformation helps us to better understand the behavior of the expression. Now, let's analyze the inequality:
\[-4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21.\]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25.\]
Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is a square term, it is always non-negative, so the left part of the inequality \(0 < (x^2 + 2)^2\) is always true. We only need to focus on the right part:
\[(x^2 + 2)^2 < 25.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[|x^2 + 2| < 5.\]
This absolute value inequality can be split into two separate inequalities:
\[-5 < x^2 + 2 < 5.\]

Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
4 - 12 = -8.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2p.
\]
We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substitute this into the identity:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p).
\]
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Rearrange to solve for \(s^2 - 3p\):
\[
s^2 - 3p = -\frac{8}{s}.
\]

Now, consider the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We can factor this expression:
\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(y + z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\), we rewrite it as:
\[
xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12.
\]
Distribute and combine like terms:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12.
\]
Since \(xyz = 4\), we have:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3 \cdot 4 = 12.
\]
Simplify:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 12 = 12.
\]
Add 12 to both sides:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) = 24.
\]
Since \(p = xy + yz + zx\), we have:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

We now have two equations:
\[
s^2 - 3p = -\frac{8}{s},
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]

From \(sp = 24\), solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into \(s^2 - 3p = -\frac{8}{s}\):
\[
s^2 - 3 \left(\frac{24}{s}\right) = -\frac{8}{s}.
\]
Multiply through by \(s\) to clear the fraction:
\[
s^3 - 72 = -8.
\]
Add 72 to both sides:
\[
s^3 = 64.
\]
Take the cube root of both sides:
\[
s = 4.
\]

Substitute \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[
\boxed{6}.

"To determine the class in which the number of students who buy the bus ticket is 135% of the number of students who buy the bus stop, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of students in each class:**
   - Class 9a: \(41.1\% + 39.4\% = 80.5\%\)
   - Class 10a: \(34.4\% + 33.1\% = 67.5\%\)
   - Class 11a: \(20.6\% + 13.8\% = 34.4\%\)

2. **Determine the total number of students in the school:**
   - Let \(N\) be the total number of students in the school.
   - The total number of students in each class is given as 300 for b type and 300 for f type.
   - Therefore, the total number of students in the school is:
     \[
     N = 300 + 300 = 600

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the teren reptungh triangular plot, we need to analyze the given information and the shape of the plot. The plot consists of a rectangle with two semicircles on its sides. The perimeter of the plot, which includes the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles, is given as 400 meters.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The perimeter of the plot can be expressed as:
\[ L + L + W + W = 2L + 2W = 400 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ L + W = 200 \]
The area of the plot is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is:
\[ \text{Area of the rectangle} = L \times W \]
The area of one semicircle is:
\[ \text{Area of one semicircle} = \frac{1}{2} \pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{W^2}{4} = \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \]
Since there are two semicircles, the total area of the semicircles is:
\[ \text{Area of the semicircles} = 2 \times \frac{\pi W^2}{8} = \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]
Therefore, the total area of the plot is:
\[ \text{Total area} = L \times W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} \]
We can express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) using the equation \( L + W = 200 \):
\[ L = 200 - W \]
Substituting this into the area formula, we get:
\[ \text{Total area} = (200 - W)W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - W^2 + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W + W^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1\right) \]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of the area with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dW} \left( 200W + W^2 \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1\right) \right) = 200 + 2W \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1\right) = 0 \]
Solving for \( W \):
\[ 200 + 2W \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1\right) = 0 \]
\[ 2W \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1\right) = -200 \]
\[ W \left(\frac{\pi}{4} - 1\right) = -100 \]
\[ W = \frac{-100}{\frac{\pi}{4} - 1} = \frac{-400}{\pi - 4} \]
Since \( W \) must be positive, we take the absolute value:
\[ W = \frac{400}{4 - \pi} \]
Substituting \( W \) back into the equation \( L = 200 - W \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{400}{4 - \pi} = \frac{800 - 400}{4 - \pi} = \frac{400}{4 - \pi} \]
Now, we can calculate the maximum area:
\[ \text{Maximum area} = L \times W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = \left(\frac{400}{4 - \pi}\right) \left(\frac{400}{4 - \pi}\right) + \frac{\pi \left(\frac{400}{4 - \pi}\right)^2}{4} \]

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
   - \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\).

2. **Understand the relationship between the angles:**
   - Since \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\), \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles. Therefore, \(\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ\).

3. **Use the property of complementary angles:**
   - For complementary angles, the sine of one angle is equal to the cosine of the other. Thus, \(\sin{T} = \cos{R}\).

4. **Find \(\cos{R}\):**
   - We know \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, \(\sin{R}\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse.

"To determine the distance from the origin to the point on the parabola \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function. The distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the parabola is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substitute \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand the square term:

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we minimize \( D^2 \):

\[
D^2 = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Let \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). To find the critical points, take the derivative and set it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}

For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \). We will consider the two cases for the function \( f(x) \) separately.

### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = 3 - x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[
3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
\]
So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
\]
Since \( -3 \leq 3 \), this solution is valid. So, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

### Case 2: \( x > 3 \)
For \( x > 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)
We set \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
\]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:
\[
-x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
\]
The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid in this case.

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
\]
We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
\]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 2 \) is not a valid solution in this case.

### Conclusion
From the above analysis, the only valid solutions are from the first case:
\[
f^{-1}(0) = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad f^{-1}(6) = -3
\]
Thus,
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the center of the regular octahedron. The center of the octahedron is equidistant from all its vertices. Let's denote the center of the octahedron as \( O \).

Given the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 respectively, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex \( F \).

First, let's place the octahedron in a coordinate system. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be placed at the following coordinates:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

The center \( O \) of the octahedron is at the origin \((0, 0, 0)\).

The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is the same for all vertices. Let's denote this distance as \( d \).

We can use the distance formula to express the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \):
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x_P - 1)^2 + y_P^2 + z_P^2} = 3

\[
PB = \sqrt{(x_P + 1)^2 + y_P^2 + z_P^2} = 7

\[
PC = \sqrt{x_P^2 + (y_P - 1)^2 + z_P^2} = 8

\[
PD = \sqrt{x_P^2 + (y_P + 1)^2 + z_P^2} = 9

\[
PE = \sqrt{x_P^2 + y_P^2 + (z_P - 1)^2} = 11
\]

We need to find \( PF \):
\[
PF = \sqrt{x_P^2 + y_P^2 + (z_P + 1)^2}
\]

To find \( d \), we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is constant. This sum is given by:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 6d^2

Substituting the given distances:

\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + PF^2 = 6d^2

\[

We also know that:

PF^2 = 6d^2 - 324
\]

Since \( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 3d^2 + 3d^2 = 6d^2 \), we have:
\[
324 + PF^2 = 6d^2

Thus:
\[
PF^2 = 6d^2 - 324

Since \( PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 = 3d^2 + 3d^2 = 6d^2 \), we have:

Thus:

"To determine how many times the digit 6 appears in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8, and then count the occurrences of the digit 6 in each representation.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 3: Count the occurrences of the digit 6 in each representation

- In the base 7 representation \(1556_7\), the digit 6 appears once.
- In the base 8 representation \(1165_8\), the digit 6 appears once.

### Step 4: Sum the occurrences of the digit 6

Adding the occurrences from both representations, we get:

\[
1 + 1 = 2
\]

Thus, the total number of times the digit 6 appears in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",3,"[3, '3']",False

"To determine the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we first need to find the polynomial \( g(x) \) itself. Given that \( g(x) \) is equal to \( f(x-1) \), we start by substituting \( x-1 \) into \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get:
\[ f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we need to expand each term in the expression for \( f(x-1) \).

First, expand \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

Next, expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

Now, expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

Putting it all together, we have:
\[ f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

Thus, the polynomial \( g(x) \) is:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is obtained by evaluating the polynomial at \( x = 1 \). Therefore, we evaluate \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15. \]

Simplify the expression:
\[ 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15 = (3 + 23 + 15) - (12 + 31) = 41 - 43 = -2. \]

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"To solve the problem, we start by finding the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). Let's denote the roots by \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\).

First, we use the fact that the polynomial is a quartic equation, and we can try to factor it or use numerical methods to find the roots. However, for this problem, we will use the properties of the roots and symmetric functions of the roots.

The polynomial can be written as:
\[x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0.\]

We can use the fact that the sum of the roots taken one at a time (by Vieta's formulas) is \(-2\), the sum of the roots taken two at a time is \(0\), the sum of the roots taken three at a time is \(-2\), and the product of the roots is \(2\).

We need to find the value of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

Consider the polynomial \(P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\). The roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) satisfy the polynomial equation. We can use the fact that the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero, i.e., \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\).

Now, let's consider the expression \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\). We can use the fact that the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero, and the product of the roots is 2. We can also use the fact that the polynomial is symmetric and the roots are distinct.

By symmetry and the properties of the roots, we can deduce that the value of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) are all equal to \(-1\).

Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{-1, -1, -1\}\), and the sum of the elements in this set is:

"To determine the cost of an individual creion, we need to analyze the given information and set up a system of equations. Let's denote the cost of a creion as \( c \) and the cost of a radish jumbo as \( r \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( c + r = 1.24 \)
2. \( 2c + r = 1.82 \)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( r \):
\[
(2c + r) - (c + r) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2c + r - c - r = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
\[
c = 0.58
\]

So, the cost of an individual creion is \( c = 0.58 \).

To verify, we can substitute \( c = 0.58 \) back into the first equation to find \( r \):
\[
0.58 + r = 1.24
\]
Subtracting 0.58 from both sides, we get:
\[
r = 1.24 - 0.58
\]
\[
r = 0.66
\]

Now, let's check if these values satisfy the second equation:
\[
2c + r = 2(0.58) + 0.66 = 1.16 + 0.66 = 1.82
\]
The values satisfy the second equation, confirming our solution is correct.

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) by performing the division step-by-step.

Let's do the division:

- 500 goes into 1370 (we add a decimal point and a zero to 137, making it 1370) 2 times (because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)). So, we write 2 after the decimal point.
- Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get 370.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 3700.
- 500 goes into 3700 7 times (because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)). So, we write 7 after the 2.
- Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get 200.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 2000.
- 500 goes into 2000 4 times (because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)). So, we write 4 after the 7.
- Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get 0.

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

First, let's consider the geometry of the problem. The center \(O\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is the intersection of the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\). The diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other, so \(O\) is the midpoint of both \(AC\) and \(BD\).

The region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments \(OA\), \(OB\), \(OC\), and \(OD\). These bisectors divide the rectangle into four congruent right triangles, each with \(O\) as the right angle.

The area of each of these right triangles is one-fourth of the area of the rectangle. Therefore, the region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the area of one of these right triangles.

Since the four right triangles are congruent and cover the entire area of the rectangle, the area of the region where a point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is one-fourth of the area of the rectangle.

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( 1.0472 \) is \( 2 \), so \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 6.708 \) is \( 6 \), so \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 4 \) is \( 4 \), so \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To find the average grade of the students, we need to calculate the total sum of all the grades and then divide by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the grades:

- There are 8 students who each received a grade of 90. So, the total sum for these students is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- There are 2 students who each received a grade of 100. So, the total sum for these students is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Now, we add up all these sums to get the total sum of all the grades:

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given 4x4 magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the numbers in the square:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 & 2n-9 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to find the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (2n-9)
\]

Simplify this expression:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (2n-9) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 + 2n - 9
\]
\[
= n + n + 2n - 3 + 3 + 1 - 9
\]
\[
= 4n - 8
\]

So, the sum of the numbers in the first row is \( 4n - 8 \). This sum must be equal to the sum of the numbers in any other row, column, or diagonal.

Next, let's consider the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + 2 + n + (n-1)
\]

Simplify this expression:
\[
(n+2) + 2 + n + (n-1) = n + 2 + 2 + n + n - 1
\]
\[
= n + n + n + 2 + 2 - 1
\]
\[
= 3n + 3
\]

So, the sum of the numbers in the second row is \( 3n + 3 \). This sum must also be equal to the sum of the numbers in any other row, column, or diagonal.

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the two sums equal to each other:
\[
4n - 8 = 3n + 3
\]

Solve for \( n \):
\[
4n - 3n = 3 + 8

"To determine who will be the first to merge, we need to calculate the time it takes for each person to complete their respective tasks.

First, let's calculate the time it takes for Jim to merge peles along the diagonal of the trapezoid. The trapezoid has bases of 300 cm and 400 cm, and a height of 200 cm. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the height, the difference in the bases, and the diagonal. The difference in the bases is 400 cm - 300 cm = 100 cm. So, the length of the diagonal is:

\[
\sqrt{200^2 + 100^2} = \sqrt{40000 + 10000} = \sqrt{50000} = 100\sqrt{5} \text{ cm}
\]

Assuming Jim can merge peles at a rate of 1 pe per cm (since the problem does not specify the rate, we assume it is 1 pe per cm for simplicity), the time it takes for Jim to merge all the peles along the diagonal is:

\[
100\sqrt{5} \text{ cm} \times 1 \text{ pe/cm} = 100\sqrt{5} \text{ pe}
\]

Next, let's calculate the time it takes for Martha to merge peles along the length of the trapezoid. The length of the trapezoid is 400 cm, so the time it takes for Martha to merge all the peles along the length is:

\[
400 \text{ cm} \times 1 \text{ pe/cm} = 400 \text{ pe}
\]

Now, we compare the two times. Since \(\sqrt{5} \approx 2.236\), we have:

\[
100\sqrt{5} \approx 100 \times 2.236 = 223.6 \text{ pe}
\]

So, Jim takes approximately 223.6 pe to merge all the peles, and Martha takes 400 pe. Since 223.6 pe is less than 400 pe, Jim will merge all the peles before Martha.

Therefore, Jim will be the first to merge. The answer is:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other property of the cube roots of unity is that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Now, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
\]
So, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest path for a skier to run from point \( A \) to point \( B \) to point \( C \) or \( D \), we need to consider the geometric properties of the points and the constraints of the problem. The shortest path between two points is a straight line. Therefore, the skier should run in a straight line from point \( A \) to point \( B \), and then from point \( B \) to point \( C \) or \( D \).

The total distance the skier needs to run is the sum of the distances from \( A \) to \( B \), and from \( B \) to \( C \) or \( D \). The exact distance will depend on the specific coordinates or positions of points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).

If we assume that the points are in a plane and we know their coordinates, we can use the distance formula to calculate the distances. The distance formula between two points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]

So, the total distance the skier needs to run is:

\[
d_{AB} + d_{BC} \quad \text{or} \quad d_{AB} + d_{BD}
\]

where \( d_{AB} \) is the distance from \( A \) to \( B \), \( d_{BC} \) is the distance from \( B \) to \( C \), and \( d_{BD} \) is the distance from \( B \) to \( D \).

Therefore, the shortest path the skier can take is:

\[
\boxed{d_{AB} + d_{BC} \text{ or } d_{AB} + d_{BD}}
