"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We are given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(D\) as \(EF\) and the hypotenuse as \(DE\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(DE\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) which is the result of rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i

3. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   A rotation by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this to:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = \sqrt{11^2} \times \sqrt{2} = 11 \sqrt{2}.\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are not all sitting next to each other, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a circle:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people in a circle is \((n-1)!\). For 8 people, this is:
   \[
   (8-1)! = 7! = 5040
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all sitting next to each other:**
   Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosace-Thomas block and the other 5 people) in a circle, which can be done in \((6-1)! = 5!\) ways. Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all sitting next to each other is:
   \[

"To find the coefficient of the \(x^4\) term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x^4\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to determine the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is 4. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the remainder when the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by first reducing each of the factors modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 = 7 + 1\text{)}

Simplify the product:

\[

So,

\[

"To determine the smallest number of degrees that a circle must be rotated to align with a given position, we need to understand the concept of rotational symmetry.

Each of these positions corresponds to a rotation of \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \).

If En expressades at random, the smallest number of degrees that the circle must be rotated to align with the given position is the smallest angle of rotation that will bring the circle back to its original position.

"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram and find the value of \(x + y\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

First, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5 + 7}{2}, \frac{3 + 4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6 + x}{2}, \frac{8 + y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6 + x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8 + y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

So, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((6, -1)\). Now, we need to find the value of \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 6 + (-1) = 5

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Vertical Asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We start by setting the denominator equal to zero and solving for \( x \):

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
\]

This is a quadratic equation. We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -14 \):

\[
x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-14)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7
\]

\[
x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2
\]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Horizontal Asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

- If the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).
- If the degree of the numerator is equal to the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = \frac{a}{b} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are the leading coefficients of the numerator and the denominator, respectively.
- If the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote (but there may be an oblique asymptote).

In our function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

### Sum of \( a + b + c \)
Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to analyze the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \).

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

\]

We solve the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\) using the quadratic formula:
\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 28}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of these eigenvalues:

Since \(z \neq 1\), we exclude \(k = 0\), leaving us with \(z = e^{2\pi i / 5}, e^{4\pi i / 5}, e^{6\pi i / 5}, e^{8\pi i / 5}\).

We need to compute the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\) and \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

This simplifies to:
\[

To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare coefficients.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately:

\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we verify our values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into equations 2 and 3:

For equation 2:

\[
3b + 20 = 3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]

For equation 3:

\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

Both equations are satisfied, so our values are correct. Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which water is being added.

First, let's denote the radius of the cylindrical tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the tank by \( h \) meters. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per minute and that water is being added at a rate of 4 cubic meters per minute. This means that the height of the water in the tank is increasing at a rate of 4 cubic meters per minute. Since the volume of a cylinder is also given by \( V = \pi r^2 h \), we can differentiate this equation with respect to time \( t \) to find the rate of change of the height \( h \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):
\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, let's consider the behavior of the function in the interval \(x \geq a\). Here, the function is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\) if \(a = 0\). For \(a > 0\), the vertex is at \(x = 0\) and \(y = 0\), but we are interested in the vertex at \(x = a\) and \(y = a^3\). So, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval is \(a^3\).

Next, let's consider the behavior of the function in the interval \(x < a\). Here, the function is a straight line with a slope of \(a\) and a y-intercept of \(2a\). The minimum value of this linear function is approached as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, which is \(a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of the function in the interval \(x < a\) must be less than or equal to the minimum value of the function in the interval \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3. \]

Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the inequality holds. Testing the intervals determined by these roots, we get:

- For \(a < -1\), the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is negative.
- For \(-1 < a < 0\), the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is positive.
- For \(0 < a < 2\), the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is negative.
- For \(a > 2\), the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) is positive.

Since \(a\) is a positive number, we only consider the intervals \(0 < a < 2\) and \(a > 2\). The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies the inequality is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\). We are given that the radius is 1, so the radius squared is \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
The second solution \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is valid only if it lies in the interval \([0,1]\). This means:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\) is always true for \(\lambda > 0\). The inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \geq 0\) implies \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, the fixed point \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is valid for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then the equation is satisfied. If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, so let's substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
This is a fixed point, so we need to find another \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's consider the case when \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = x.
\]
If \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), then:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2},
\]
and
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
This is a fixed point, so we need to find another \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's consider the case when \(\lambda = 4\):
\[
f(x) = 4x(1 - x) = 4x - 4x^2.
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(4x^2 - 4x + 1).

We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
4(4x - 4x^2)(4x^2 - 4x + 1) = x.

If \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), then:
\[

"To solve for the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta\) is given by the expression

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formulas, we can rewrite the terms involving products of cosines and sines. Recall that \(\cos A \cos B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A+B) + \cos (A-B)]\) and \(\sin A \sin B = \frac{1}{2} [\cos (A-B) - \cos (A+B)]\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression can be simplified using the product-to-sum identities and the fact that \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\). Thus, we can rewrite the terms as follows:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 85^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 5^\circ + \cos 15^\circ],
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ],
\]
\[
\sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 85^\circ] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \sin 5^\circ].
\]

Substituting these into the numerator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\cos 25^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\sin 5^\circ + \cos 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \cos 25^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 15^\circ - \sin 5^\circ] = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the same product-to-sum identities, we can rewrite the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ],
\]
\[
\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 5^\circ + \sin 15^\circ],
\]
\[
\cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ],
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \frac{1}{2} [\sin 85^\circ - \sin 15^\circ] = \frac{1}{2} [\cos 5^\circ - \sin 15^\circ].
\]

Substituting these into the denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 5^\circ + \sin 15^\circ] + \frac{1}{2} [\sin 25^\circ - \sin 15^\circ] - \frac{1}{2} [\cos 5^\circ - \sin 15^\circ] = \sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We recognize that this is the tangent of the angle whose tangent is \(\tan (25^\circ + 5^\circ) = \tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\). Therefore, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum value might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:

\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]

Now, we need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:

\[ g'(x) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[ \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]

We now evaluate \( g(x) \) at these critical points and at the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \):

\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]

\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]

The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1, which occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is also 1, and it is achieved when \( x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \).

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \| \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} \|

Here, \(\mathbf{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\mathbf{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[

Finally, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is:

\[

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this quadratic equation are the golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( \phi \) or \( \frac{1}{\phi} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Let's consider the case where \( z = \phi \). Then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{\phi} \), and we have:
\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi + \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} = 1. \]
However, this contradicts the given equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \). Therefore, \( z \) must be \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

The golden ratio \( \phi \) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). We can use this property to find higher powers of \( \phi \). Specifically, we have:
\[ \phi^3 = \phi \cdot \phi^2 = \phi (\phi + 1) = \phi^2 + \phi = (\phi + 1) + \phi = 2\phi + 1, \]
\[ \phi^4 = \phi \cdot \phi^3 = \phi (2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2, \]
\[ \phi^5 = \phi \cdot \phi^4 = \phi (3\phi + 2) = 3\phi^2 + 2\phi = 3(\phi + 1) + 2\phi = 5\phi + 3. \]
We observe that \( \phi^n = F_n \phi + F_{n-1} \), where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, we have:
\[ \phi^{85} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84}. \]
Similarly, \( \frac{1}{\phi} \) satisfies \( \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{\phi} + 1 \), and we can use the same recurrence relation for the Fibonacci numbers to find:
\[ \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right)^{85} = F_{85} \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right) + F_{84} = \frac{F_{85}}{\phi} + F_{84}. \]
Thus, we have:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \frac{F_{85}}{\phi} + F_{84} = F_{85} \left( \phi + \frac{1}{\phi} \right) + 2F_{84} = F_{85} \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) + 2F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot 1 + 2F_{84} = F_{85} + 2F_{84}. \]
The 85th and 84th Fibonacci numbers are \( F_{85} = 49845673281429092 \) and \( F_{84} = 31781100, \) respectively. Therefore, we have:
\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 49845673281429092 + 2 \cdot 31781100 = 49845673281429092 + 63562200 = 49845673344991292. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle \(ABC\) and the medians and centroid \(G\).

1. **Identify the Centroid and Medians:**
   The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(G\) is located at \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side.

2. **Properties of the Centroid and Parallels:**
   Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. The line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) will intersect \(AB\) and \(AC\) at points \(M\) and \(N\) respectively, such that \(M\) and \(N\) are the midpoints of \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively. This is because the line through the centroid parallel to a side of the triangle will intersect the other two sides at their midpoints.

3. **Area Relationships:**
   The line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and half its length because \(M\) and \(N\) are midpoints. This means that triangle \(AGM\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{1}{2}\). The area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its sides, so the area of triangle \(AGM\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

4. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \(AGM\):**
   The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGM\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AGM = \frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The area of triangle \(WGH\) is the same as the area of triangle \(AGM\) because \(W\) is the same as \(G\) and \(GH\) is parallel to \(BC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(WGH\) is also 36.

2. Recall the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

   where \(d\) is the common difference and \(n\) is the number of terms.

3. Since we don't know \(n\) or \(d\) yet, we can use the fact that the middle term of an arithmetic sequence is the average of the first and last terms if the number of terms is odd. For an even number of terms, the middle term is the average of the two middle terms, but since we are not given the number of terms, we assume it is odd for simplicity (as the problem implies a single middle term).

"To determine if a number is a multiple of both 100 and 150, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
- The prime factorization of 100 is \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\).
- The prime factorization of 150 is \(150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2\).

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
- The highest power of 2 is \(2^2\).
- The highest power of 3 is \(3^1\).
- The highest power of 5 is \(5^2\).

Therefore, the LCM of 100 and 150 is:

A_{\text{triangle}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of the rectangle. The width of the rectangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 3 units. The height of the rectangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units. The area \(A_{\text{rectangle}}\) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_{\text{rectangle}} = \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
A_{\text{rectangle}} = 3 \times 4 = 12
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the right triangle and the rectangle:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{triangle}} + A_{\text{rectangle}} = 4 + 12 = 16

"To determine the probability that the b tent is placed on a square road, we need to analyze the process step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 possible choices for the first number (since it is divided by 4).
   - After choosing the first number, there are 3 remaining choices for the second number (since it is divided by 5).
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 3 = 12\).

2. **Identify the favorable outcomes:**
   - The b tent is placed on a square road if the first number chosen is a multiple of 4. The only multiples of 4 in the set \{1, 2, 3, 4\} are 4 itself.
   - If the first number chosen is 4, then the second number chosen must be one of the remaining numbers \{1, 2, 3\}.
   - Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes: (4, 1), (4, 2), and (4, 3).

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the fraction. The denominator can be rewritten as \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2\). Thus, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This division gives us:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). To find the sum of the digits in this decimal, we add the digits 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, and 5:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for the product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

1. **Understanding Cylindrical Coordinates**:
   - \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
   - \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, measured from the positive \( x \)-axis.
   - \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Analyzing the Equation \( z = c \)**:
   - The equation \( z = c \) means that the \( z \)-coordinate is constant and equal to \( c \) for all values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).
   - This implies that the shape extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions, but it is constrained to the plane where \( z = c \).

3. **Visualizing the Shape**:
   - Since \( z \) is fixed at \( c \), the shape is a flat surface that extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions.
   - This flat surface is a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and located at \( z = c \).

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about their magnitudes and the cross product.

Given:
\[
\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2, \quad \|\mathbf{b}\| = 7, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, substituting the known values into the magnitude formula:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\):
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

"To determine the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The function \( g(x) \) is defined as:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

To find the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to solve:
\[ g(x) = 0 \]
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]

Let \( y = x + 5 \). Then:
\[ f(y) = 0 \]

The roots of \( f(y) = 0 \) are the same as the roots of \( f(x) = 0 \). Therefore, the roots of \( f(x) \) are also the roots of \( g(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is a cubic polynomial of the form:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

For a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots (denoted as \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \)) is given by:

\[ a = 1 \]
\[ b = -49 \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

Since the roots of \( g(x) \) are the same as the roots of \( f(x) \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is also:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean identity for secant and tangent:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity to \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]

Similarly, for \(\csc^2 20^\circ\) and \(\csc^2 40^\circ\), we use the identity for cosecant:
\[
\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Now, substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Combine the constants:
\[
= 1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the identity for cotangent in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}
\]
Thus:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

We need to find a way to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\). Notice that:
\[
\tan 20^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 10^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}

\[
\tan 40^\circ = \tan (30^\circ + 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ + \tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]

However, these identities are complex to handle directly. Instead, we use a known result from trigonometric identities:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} = 12
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we start by using the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \). Let's denote the measure of the missing interior angle by \( x \). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070 + x
\]

Since \( x \) is an interior angle of the polygon, it must be less than \( 180^\circ \). This means:

\[
180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

Simplifying the inequality, we get:

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]

Dividing both sides by 180, we obtain:

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
n-2 < 6.9444

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[
n-2 \leq 6
\]

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

\[

\]

Next, we need to check if \( n = 8 \) is a valid solution. If \( n = 8 \), the sum of all interior angles is:

\[
180(8-2) = 1080^\circ
\]

If the sum of all but one interior angle is \( 1070^\circ \), then the missing angle \( x \) is:

\[
x = 1080 - 1070 = 10^\circ

Since \( 10^\circ \) is a valid interior angle, \( n = 8 \) is indeed a solution. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

5. **Simplify the square root**: We need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need an integer \( k \) such that:
   \[
   k^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
   \]
   By trial or using a method to find square roots modulo a prime, we find that:

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie inside the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates that lie within the rectangle.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of any point inside the rectangle must satisfy \(-5 < x < 5\). This means \(x\) can be any integer from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. So, the possible values for \(x\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 possible values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the \(y\)-coordinates of any point inside the rectangle must satisfy \(-4 < y < 4\). This means \(y\) can be any integer from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. So, the possible values for \(y\) are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). There are 7 possible values for \(y\).

Since the coordinates of the points are independent of each other, the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle is the product of the number of possible \(x\)-coordinates and the number of possible \(y\)-coordinates. Therefore, the total number of points is:

\[9 \times 7 = 63\]

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}
\]

We are given the following cross products:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[

\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}, \quad 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

Adding these vectors together, we get:

2. Count the number of frimeries in the 70's.
3. Calculate the total price of all the frimeries in the 70's.
4. Divide the total price by the number of frimeries to find the average price.

From the table, the prices of the frimeries in the 70's are:
- 12 cent for 12 frimeries in the 60's
- 12 cent for 12 frimeries in the 70's
- 8 cent for 6 frimeries in the 60's

Now, we calculate the average price:

"To solve for the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) in the given trapezoid \(ABCD\) where \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), and the area of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the properties and relationships:**
   - Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).
   - Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), let \( \angle BAC = \angle CAD = \theta \).

2. **Express the area of the trapezoid:**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
   \[
   [ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h
   \]
   where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid, which is the same as the length of \(AC\) because \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \).

3. **Express the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \):**
   The area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) is:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h
   \]
   Since \(h = AC\), we can substitute \(h\) with \(AC\).

4. **Relate the areas:**
   The area of the trapezoid can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of triangles \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):
   \[
   [ABCD] = [ACD] + [ABC]
   \]
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), triangles \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) share the same height \(AC\) and their bases are \(AD\) and \(BC\) respectively. Therefore, the area of \( \triangle ABC \) can be written as:
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC
   \]
   However, since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) are in the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\). Let \(AD = x\) and \(BC = y\). Then:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{x}{x+y} \times [ABCD]
   \]
   and
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{y}{x+y} \times [ABCD]
   \]
   Since \( [ABCD] = 42 \), we have:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{x}{x+y} \times 42
   \]
   and
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{y}{x+y} \times 42
   \]
   Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times AC
   \]
   But we also know that:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{x}{x+y} \times 42
   \]
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height, we can use the fact that the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half the product of the base \(AD\) and the height \(AC\). Therefore, we can directly use the ratio to find the area of \( \triangle ACD \):
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times AC = \frac{x}{x+y} \times 42
   \]
   Since the total area is 42, and the area of \( \triangle ACD \) is half of the total area because \( \overline{AC} \) bisects the angle and is the height, we have:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\) for \(x\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:

   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}

4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Here, we have \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}\). So, we identify \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition of the operation, we get:

First, we calculate the product of the numerators and the fraction:

\[
(7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:

\[

Now, we substitute this back into our expression:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect each other, we need to consider the geometric properties of the segments and the circle.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with points \(A, B, C, D\) on its circumference.
   - We need to find the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect each other.

2. **Geometric Insight:**
   - For two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A, B, C, D\) must be arranged such that one segment crosses the other.
   - This happens if and only if the points \(A, B, C, D\) are arranged in an alternating manner around the circle. That is, if we traverse the circle, the points appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), and so on.

3. **Counting the Total Arrangements:**
   - There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle has no starting point and can be rotated, we divide by 4 to account for rotations. Thus, there are \(\frac{4!}{4} = 3\) distinct ways to arrange 4 points on a circle.
   - Out of these 3 distinct arrangements, only 2 of them result in the segments intersecting. These are the alternating arrangements mentioned above.

4. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. Let's start by analyzing the given information and the geometry of the situation.

We have two circles with centers \(D\), one with radius 1 and the other with radius 2. The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\). The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\). The total area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, which is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

The shaded region consists of two segments of the circles. The area of the shaded region can also be calculated as the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta\) and the area of the sector of the smaller circle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta\). Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[2\theta - \frac{1}{2}\theta = \frac{3}{2}\theta.\]
We know this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[\frac{3}{2}\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}.\]
Solving for \(\theta\), we get:
\[\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}.\]
Since \(\theta\) is in radians, we need to convert it to degrees. The conversion factor is \(\frac{180}{\pi}\), so:
\[\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180}{9} = 200^\circ.\]
However, \(\theta\) is the angle subtended by the arc in the larger circle, and we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the smaller circle. Since the angle subtended by the same arc in the smaller circle is half of the angle in the larger circle, we have:

"To determine how many spherical marbles with a diameter of 8 cm and a radius of 3 cm can fit into a cylindrical tank with a radius of 6 cm, we need to follow these steps:

   \[
   V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3

   Given the radius \( r = 3 \) cm, we substitute this value into the formula:

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[

\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.

"To determine the number of ways to form a committee of 5 members from a group of 8 republians and 6 demokrater, with the condition that at least one member is a repubian, we can use the principle of complementary counting.

\]
Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
\[
a + b + c = 72
\]

Next, we use the information about the product:
\[
a \times b \times c = 120
\]

We need to find the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) that satisfy both equations. Let's start by considering possible factorizations of 120 that add up to 72.

First, we list the factor pairs of 120:
\[
120 = 1 \times 120
\]
\[
120 = 2 \times 60
\]
\[
120 = 3 \times 40
\]
\[
120 = 4 \times 30
\]
\[
120 = 5 \times 24
\]
\[
120 = 6 \times 20
\]
\[
120 = 8 \times 15
\]
\[
120 = 10 \times 12
\]

We need to find a combination of three factors that multiply to 120 and add up to 72. Let's test the factorization \(10, 12, 1\):
\[
10 \times 12 \times 1 = 120
\]
\[
10 + 12 + 1 = 23
\]
This does not add up to 72.

Next, let's test the factorization \(5, 8, 3\):
\[
5 \times 8 \times 3 = 120
\]
\[
5 + 8 + 3 = 16
\]
This does not add up to 72.

Now, let's test the factorization \(6, 5, 4\):
\[
6 \times 5 \times 4 = 120
\]
\[
6 + 5 + 4 = 15
\]
This does not add up to 72.

Finally, let's test the factorization \(15, 8, 1\):
\[
15 \times 8 \times 1 = 120
\]
\[
15 + 8 + 1 = 24
\]
This does not add up to 72.

We need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the factorization \(10, 6, 2\):
\[
10 \times 6 \times 2 = 120
\]
\[
10 + 6 + 2 = 18
\]
This does not add up to 72.

Finally, let's test the factorization \(15, 8, 1\):
\[
15 \times 8 \times 1 = 120
\]
\[
15 + 8 + 1 = 24
\]
This does not add up to 72.

After re-evaluating, we find the correct factorization is \(10, 6, 2\):
\[
10 \times 6 \times 2 = 120
\]
\[
10 + 6 + 2 = 18
\]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Isolate the cube root expression:**
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
   \]

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**
   \[
   (\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
   \]

3. **Simplify the left-hand side:**
   Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial:
   \[
   (x - 2)^2 = 4096
   \]

4. **Take the square root of both sides:**
   \[
   \sqrt{(x - 2)^2} = \sqrt{4096}
   \]
   This gives us:
   \[
   |x - 2| = 64

5. **Solve the absolute value equation:**
   The absolute value equation \(|x - 2| = 64\) has two solutions:
   \[

6. **Solve for \(x\) in each case:**
   \[
   x - 2 = 64 \implies x = 66

   \[

7. **Identify the positive solution:**

Therefore, the expression becomes:

This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), and point \( D \) on \( AM \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to find the circumradius of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( AM \) is the altitude, \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), and \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[ AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}. \]

Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[ \frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = 2R, \]
where \( R \) is the circumradius of \( \triangle ABC \). Since \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( BC = 2x \), we have:
\[ \frac{2x}{\sin 3\theta} = 2R. \]
Thus,
\[ R = \frac{x}{\sin 3\theta}. \]

Next, we use the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABM \):
\[ \frac{AB}{\sin \angle AMB} = 2R', \]
where \( R' \) is the circumradius of \( \triangle ABM \). Since \( \angle AMB = 90^\circ \), we have:
\[ \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}{1} = 2R'. \]
Thus,
\[ R' = \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}{2}. \]

Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( R' = R \). Therefore,
\[ R = \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}{2}. \]

We also know that \( \angle BAC = \theta \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Using the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle, we can use the identity for the circumradius of a triangle with an angle of \( 3\theta \):
\[ R = \frac{a}{2 \sin A}, \]
where \( a \) is the side opposite angle \( A \). In this case, \( a = BC = 2x \) and \( A = \theta \), so:
\[ R = \frac{2x}{2 \sin \theta} = \frac{x}{\sin \theta}. \]

We also know that \( \sin 3\theta = 3 \sin \theta - 4 \sin^3 \theta \). Using the identity for the circumradius, we have:
\[ R = \frac{x}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}{2}. \]

Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ 2x = \sqrt{121 + x^2}. \]
Squaring both sides, we have:
\[ 4x^2 = 121 + x^2, \]
\[ 3x^2 = 121, \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{121}{3}, \]
\[ x = \frac{11}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}. \]

Substituting \( x \) back into the expression for \( R \), we get:
\[ R = \frac{\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}}{\sin \theta} = \frac{\sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}\right)^2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{121 + \frac{363}{9}}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{121 + \frac{121}{3}}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{363 + 121}{3}}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{484}{3}}}{2} = \frac{\frac{22}{\sqrt{3}}}{2} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{11\sqrt{3}}{3}. \]

"To determine the median of the 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the integers:**
   \[
   3^7 = 2187

2. **Understand the properties of the median:**
   The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set of 27 numbers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list.

3. **Assume the integers are in ascending order:**
   Let the 27 integers be \(a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots, a_{27}\) such that \(a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \cdots \leq a_{27}\). The median is \(a_{14}\).

4. **Use the property of the sum:**
   The sum of these 27 integers is 2187. To find the median, we need to consider the distribution of the numbers. If we assume the numbers are as evenly distributed as possible, the median will be close to the average of the set.

5. **Calculate the average:**
   The average of the 27 integers is:
   \[
   \frac{2187}{27} = 81

6. **Consider the distribution:**
   If the numbers are distributed as evenly as possible, the median should be close to 81. Let's assume the numbers are \(81, 81, 81, \ldots, 81\) (all numbers are 81). The sum of these 27 numbers is:
   \[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) in a more convenient form. Notice that:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2)^2 + 4x^2.\]
We can complete the square for the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\):
\[x^4 + 4x^2 = (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4.\]
This transformation is useful because it allows us to analyze the expression more easily. Now, we need to solve the inequality:
\[-4 < (x^2 + 2)^2 - 4 < 21.\]
Adding 4 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[0 < (x^2 + 2)^2 < 25.\]
Next, we take the square root of all parts of the inequality. Since \((x^2 + 2)^2\) is always non-negative, we only need to consider the positive square root:
\[0 < x^2 + 2 < 5.\]
Subtracting 2 from all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-2 < x^2 < 3.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the left part of the inequality \(-2 < x^2\) is always true. Therefore, we only need to consider the right part:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we will use symmetric polynomial identities and properties.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
4 - 12 = -8.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[

\]
We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]

Substitute \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) back into the identity:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p).
\]
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

We also have the given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten using the symmetric sums:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\), we can express \(x+y\), \(x+z\), and \(y+z\) as:
\[
x+y = s - z, \quad x+z = s - y, \quad y+z = s - x.
\]
Substitute these into the equation:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12.
\]
Distribute \(xy\), \(xz\), and \(yz\):
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12.
\]
Simplify:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = 12.
\]
Substitute \(xyz = 4\):
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 12 = 12.

Solve for \(s(xy + xz + yz)\):
\[

We now have two equations:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(s(xy + xz + yz) = 24\).

From the second equation, solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right).
\]
Simplify inside the parentheses:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right).
\]
Distribute \(s\):
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solve for \(s^3\):
\[
s^3 = 64.

Thus, \(s = 4\).

Substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation for \(p\):

\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) and \(x-36\) have opposite signs. This happens in the interval \(0 < x < 36\).

Let's denote the width of the rectangle by \( w \) and the height of the rectangle by \( h \). The diameter of each semicircle is equal to the width of the rectangle, \( w \). Therefore, the total length of the rectangle, which includes the diameters of the two semicircles, is given by:

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle RST = 90^\circ\), \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles. Therefore, we have:
\[
\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ
\]

We know that the sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\). Thus:
\[

Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side \(RT\):

\[

\[

"To find the minimum value of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \), we start by analyzing the expression inside the parentheses. The function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left( x^2 - 3 \right) \) is a quadratic function in the form of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (x^2 - 3) \).

The minimum value of the quadratic function \( x^2 - 3 \) occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value of \( x^2 - 3 \) is when \( x = 0 \). At \( x = 0 \), the value of \( x^2 - 3 \) is \( 0^2 - 3 = -3 \).

Substituting this minimum value into the original function, we get:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
Since \( x = 0 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we solve the quadratic equation:
\[ -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), we have \( x = -1 \), but this also does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there is no solution in this case.

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Testing \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 4 \):
\[ -(4)^3 + 2(4)^2 + 3(4) - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \]
So, \( x = 4 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 5 \):
\[ -(5)^3 + 2(5)^2 + 3(5) - 6 = -125 + 50 + 15 - 6 = -66 \]
So, \( x = 5 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 7 \):
\[ -(7)^3 + 2(7)^2 + 3(7) - 6 = -343 + 98 + 21 - 6 = -230 \]
So, \( x = 7 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 8 \):
\[ -(8)^3 + 2(8)^2 + 3(8) - 6 = -512 + 128 + 24 - 6 = -366 \]
So, \( x = 8 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 9 \):
\[ -(9)^3 + 2(9)^2 + 3(9) - 6 = -729 + 162 + 27 - 6 = -546 \]
So, \( x = 9 \) is not a root. Testing \( x = 10 \):
\[ -(10)^3 + 2(10)^2 + 3(10) - 6 = -1000 + 200 + 30 - 6 = -776 \]
So, \( x = 10 \) is not a root.

Therefore, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the face \( BCF \) of the tetrahedron, we first need to find the equation of the plane containing points \( B \), \( C \), and \( F \). The coordinates of these points are \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \), \( C = (0, 1, 0) \), and \( F = (0, 0, -1) \).

The general equation of a plane is given by \( ax + by + cz = d \). To find the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), \( c \), and \( d \), we can use the coordinates of points \( B \), \( C \), and \( F \).

Substituting the coordinates of point \( B \) into the plane equation, we get:
\[ -a = d \implies d = -a. \]

Substituting the coordinates of point \( C \) into the plane equation, we get:
\[ b = d \implies b = -a. \]

Substituting the coordinates of point \( F \) into the plane equation, we get:
\[ -c = d \implies c = -a. \]

Thus, the equation of the plane is:
\[ -ax - ay - az = -a. \]
Dividing through by \(-a\) (assuming \( a \neq 0 \)), we get:
\[ x + y + z = 1. \]

The distance \( D \) from a point \( (x_0, y_0, z_0) \) to a plane \( ax + by + cz + d = 0 \) is given by the formula:
\[ D = \frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}. \]

For the plane \( x + y + z = 1 \) and the point \( P = (1.2, 1.5, 1) \), we have \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), \( c = 1 \), \( d = -1 \), \( x_0 = 1.2 \), \( y_0 = 1.5 \), and \( z_0 = 1 \). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the baseball, we need to use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force (F) acting on an object is equal to the mass (m) of the object times its acceleration (a), or \( F = m \cdot a \).

Given:
- The force (F) is the same for both the softball and the baseball.
- The mass of the softball (\( m_s \)) is 200 grams.
- The mass of the baseball (\( m_b \)) is 150 grams.

Since the force is the same for both objects, we can set up the following equation based on Newton's second law:
\[ F = m_s \cdot a_s = m_b \cdot a_b \]
where \( a_s \) is the acceleration of the softball and \( a_b \) is the acceleration of the baseball.

We can solve for the ratio of the accelerations \( \frac{a_s}{a_b} \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( m_b \cdot a_b \):
\[ \frac{m_s \cdot a_s}{m_b \cdot a_b} = 1 \]
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{m_b}{m_s} \]

Substituting the given masses:
\[ \frac{a_s}{a_b} = \frac{150 \text{ grams}}{200 \text{ grams}} = \frac{150}{200} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine if the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) are the same, we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8, and then compare the results.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

The base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1556_7\), and the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(1165_8\). Since these two representations are not the same, the answer is:

"To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people are in the group and how many handshakes occur. Let's denote the number of people in the group as \( n \).

Each person shakes hands with every other person exactly once. The number of handshakes that occur in a group of \( n \) people is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), which is the number of ways to choose 2 people out of \( n \) to shake hands. This can be calculated as:

\[
\binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2}
\]

We are given that the total number of handshakes is 15. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{n(n-1)}{2} = 15

To solve for \( n \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

Next, we solve the quadratic equation \( n^2 - n - 30 = 0 \). We can factor this equation as:

\[

This gives us two possible solutions: \( n = 6 \) or \( n = -5 \). Since the number of people cannot be negative, we discard \( n = -5 \) and conclude that \( n = 6 \).

1. **Understand the relationship between \( f(x) \) and \( g(x) \):**
   Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), the polynomial \( g(x) \) is obtained by substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \).

2. **Sum of the coefficients of \( f(x) \):**
   The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( f(x) \) can be found by evaluating \( f(1) \). For \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \):
   \[
   f(1) = 3(1)^4 + 5(1)^2 - 9(1) - 2 = 3 + 5 - 9 - 2 = -3

   So, the sum of the coefficients of \( f(x) \) is \(-3\).

3. **Sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \):**
   Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is equal to \( f(1) \) because substituting \( x = 1 \) in \( g(x) \) is equivalent to substituting \( x = 0 \) in \( f(x) \) (since \( g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0) \)).

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

First, we calculate the sum of \(S_1, S_2,\) and \(S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4).

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab.
\]
We also know from Vieta's formulas that the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time is zero:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

\]
or
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
Since \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\) (from Vieta's formulas), we substitute \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\) in the equation:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2} = 0.

We also know that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), so \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4}\). Substituting \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4}\) into the equation, we get:

Since \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\), we substitute \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\) in the equation:
\[

We know that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = S_1\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = S_2\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = S_3\). Therefore, we have:

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2\), we can conclude that the value of the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{-2\}\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is such that the perpendicular distances from \( P \) to the sides \( AB \) and \( AD \) are in the ratio \( k \), we need to analyze the geometric constraints and the area of the region where this condition is satisfied.

First, let's place the rectangle \( ABCD \) in the coordinate plane with \( A = (-a, a) \), \( B = (a, a) \), \( C = (a, -a) \), and \( D = (-a, -a) \). The center of the rectangle \( O \) is at the origin \( (0, 0) \).

The perpendicular distance from a point \( P = (x, y) \) to the side \( AB \) is \( |y - a| \) and the perpendicular distance from \( P \) to the side \( AD \) is \( |x + a| \). We are given that the ratio of these distances is \( k \), so we have:
\[ \frac{|y - a|}{|x + a|} = k. \]

This equation can be split into two cases:
1. \( y - a = k(x + a) \)
2. \( y - a = -k(x + a) \)

These are the equations of two lines. Let's rewrite them in slope-intercept form:
1. \( y = kx + ka + a \)
2. \( y = -kx - ka - a \)

These lines divide the rectangle into four regions. The region where the point \( P \) can lie such that the distances are in the ratio \( k \) is the area between these two lines. The area of the rectangle is \( 4a^2 \).

The lines intersect the sides of the rectangle at the following points:
- The line \( y = kx + ka + a \) intersects \( AB \) at \( (a, ka + 2a) \) and \( AD \) at \( \left(-\frac{ka + 2a}{k}, 0\right) \).
- The line \( y = -kx - ka - a \) intersects \( AB \) at \( (-a, -ka - 2a) \) and \( AD \) at \( \left(\frac{-ka - 2a}{k}, 0\right) \).

The area of the region between these two lines is a parallelogram with height \( 2a \) and base \( \frac{2a(1 + k)}{k} \). The area of this parallelogram is:
\[ \text{Area} = 2a \cdot \frac{2a(1 + k)}{k} = \frac{4a^2(1 + k)}{k}. \]

The probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) lies in this region is the ratio of the area of the parallelogram to the area of the rectangle:
\[ \text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{4a^2(1 + k)}{k}}{4a^2} = \frac{1 + k}{k}. \]

However, since the problem asks for the probability that the point is such that the distances are in the ratio \( k \), we need to consider the symmetry of the problem. The correct probability is actually the reciprocal of the ratio because the condition \( \frac{|y - a|}{|x + a|} = k \) is symmetric with respect to the center of the rectangle. Therefore, the correct probability is:

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), which is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \), which is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{12} \]","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money is due after the interest is added, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money from all the women before interest.
2. Calculate the total interest earned.
3. Add the total interest to the total amount of money from the women.

First, let's find the total amount of money from all the women before interest:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

Adding these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money from all the women before interest is \$126.59.

Next, let's calculate the total interest earned. The interest rate is 5% per year, and the time period is 1 year. The total interest is:
\[
126.59 \times 0.05 = 6.33
\]

Now, we add the total interest to the total amount of money from the women:
\[
126.59 + 6.33 = 132.92
\]

Therefore, the total amount of money due after the interest is added is \$132.92. Since we need the answer in cents, we convert \$132.92 to cents:
\[
132.92 \times 100 = 13292
\]

So, the amount of money due in cents is:
\[
\boxed{13292}

"To determine the average score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for each group of students.
2. Sum the total scores from all groups.
3. Divide the total score by the number of students to find the average.

Let's start with the first step:

- For the 20 students who scored 80 each, the total score is:
  \[
  20 \times 80 = 1600
  \]

- For the 8 students who scored 90 each, the total score is:
  \[
  8 \times 90 = 720
  \]

- For the 2 students who scored 100 each, the total score is:
  \[
  2 \times 100 = 200
  \]

Next, we sum these total scores to get the overall total score:
\[
1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520
\]

Finally, we divide the total score by the number of students (30) to find the average score:
\[
\frac{2520}{30} = 84
\]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for which the given 3x3 magic square has the same sum in each row, column, and diagonal, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the elements of the magic square:**
   \[
   \begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
   \hline
   n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
   \hline
   n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
   \hline
   2 & n & n-1 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

2. **Calculate the sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

3. **Calculate the sum of the second row:**
   \[
   (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the sum of the third row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

5. **Calculate the sum of the first column:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
   \]

6. **Calculate the sum of the second column:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
   \]

7. **Calculate the sum of the third column:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
   \]

8. **Calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):**
   \[
   (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13
   \]

9. **Calculate the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):**
   \[
   (n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n + 1 + 2n - 9 + 2 = 3n - 6
   \]

Since the sums of all rows, columns, and diagonals must be equal, we set the sums equal to each other and solve for \( n \).

From the second row and the second column, we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
7-3 & 3 & 7+1 \\
\hline
7+2 & 2(7)-9 & 1 \\
\hline

\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline

\]

Sum of each row, column, and diagonal:
\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15

All sums are equal to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct.

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many physics books Martha can still find after Jim has already found 300 and Martha has found 400, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of physics books in the library.
2. Determine how many physics books have been found by Jim and Martha together.
3. Subtract the number of found books from the total number of books to find out how many books are still left.

The total number of physics books in the library is given as 700. Jim has found 300 books, and Martha has found 400 books. Therefore, the total number of books found by both Jim and Martha is:

\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Since the total number of books found is equal to the total number of books in the library, this means that all the books have been found. Therefore, the number of books that are still left is:

\[ 700 - 700 = 0 \]

So, the number of physics books that Martha can still find is:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^3 = 1\) and the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). From this identity, we can express \(\omega^2\) as \(-1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we simplify each term separately. Using the identity \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\), we can rewrite the second term:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega}
\]

Now, we substitute this back into the original expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}
\]

To combine these fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator is \(\omega(1 + \omega)\). Rewriting each term with this common denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} - \frac{1 + \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator \(\omega(1 + \omega)\). Using the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can express \(1 + \omega\) as \(-\omega^2\):

\[
\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega(-\omega^2) = -\omega^3 = -1
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-1}{-1} = 1
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the number of ways Hva can reise a trip through three out of four national parks, \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), and visit them in a specific order, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Choose 3 parks out of 4**: The number of ways to choose 3 parks out of 4 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{4}{3}\). This is calculated as:
   \[
   \binom{4}{3} = \frac{4!}{3!(4-3)!} = \frac{4!}{3!1!} = \frac{4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1}{3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = 4
   \]
   So, there are 4 ways to choose 3 parks out of 4.

2. **Arrange the 3 chosen parks in a specific order**: For each set of 3 parks, the number of ways to arrange them is given by the permutation formula \(3!\) (3 factorial). This is calculated as:
   \[
   3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
   \]
   So, there are 6 ways to arrange 3 parks.

3. **Combine the two results**: To find the total number of ways Hva can reize the trip, we multiply the number of ways to choose the parks by the number of ways to arrange them:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24
