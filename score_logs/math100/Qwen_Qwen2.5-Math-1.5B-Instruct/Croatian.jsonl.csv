"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We are given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(D\) as \(EF\) and the hypotenuse as \(DE\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(DE\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the value of \( w \), we need to rotate the complex number \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c \). The steps to do this are as follows:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in standard form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \):
   \[
   (z - c) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the result:
   \[
   w = 4 - 2i + 2 - 3i = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the value of \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the square root of 242, we can start by factoring 242 into its prime factors.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]

Next, we need to factor 121. We check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, so 121 is not divisible by 3. We then check if 121 is divisible by 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We then check if 121 is divisible by 7. We perform the division:
\[ 121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \]
Since the result is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. We then check if 121 is divisible by 11. We perform the division:
\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \]
Since the result is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11:
\[ 121 = 11 \times 11 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 \]

Now, we take the square root of both sides:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2} \]

Therefore, the square root of 242 is:

"To determine how many people can be geometrically represented in the given scenario, we need to carefully analyze the constraints and relationships provided. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - Na不超过 8 people.
   - Na moresle 3 people.

2. **Understand the relationship:**
   - Na moresle 3 people, which means Na can have up to 3 more people in addition to the initial 8 people.

3. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - If Na can have 3 more people, then the total number of people Na can have is \(8 + 3 = 11\).

4. **Verify the condition:**
   - The problem states that Na moresle 3 people, which means Na can have up to 3 more people in addition to the initial 8 people. This condition is satisfied with the total of 11 people.

Therefore, the total number of people that Na can have is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression for the general term:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15 - 5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute the binomial coefficient and simplify:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = -125

"To solve the problem, we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7, given that \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\).

First, substitute \(n = 2\) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \(4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8\) is divided by 7. We can do this by first reducing each of the factors modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 = 7 + 1\text{)}
\]

Now, substitute these reduced values back into the expression:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify the product:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Now, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 7 \cdot 3 + 3\text{)}
\]

So,

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}
\]

Therefore,

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of times Pravilni must repeat the phrase ""serotira supropropro"" so that the total number of letters in the resulting sequence is a multiple of 26 (the number of letters in the English alphabet).

First, let's count the number of letters in the phrase ""serotira supropropro"":
- se = 1
- ro = 2
- tira = 4
- supropropro = 10
Adding these together, we get:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 10 = 17 \]
So, the phrase ""serotira supropropro"" has 17 letters.

Next, we need to find the smallest number \( n \) such that the total number of letters in \( n \) repetitions of ""serotira supropropro"" is a multiple of 26. This can be expressed as:
\[ 17n \equiv 0 \pmod{26} \]
This means that \( 17n \) must be divisible by 26. To find the smallest \( n \), we need to determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 17 and 26, and then divide by 17.

Since 17 is a prime number and does not share any common factors with 26, the LCM of 17 and 26 is simply their product:
\[ \text{LCM}(17, 26) = 17 \times 26 = 442 \]
So, \( 17n = 442 \) when \( n = \frac{442}{17} = 26 \).

Therefore, the smallest number of times Pravilni must repeat the phrase ""serotira supropropro"" so that the total number of letters is a multiple of 26 is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram given the coordinates of the other three vertices: \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\). We are also given that \(x > 7\).

First, let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other, so the midpoint of diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of diagonal \(BD\).

The midpoint of \(AC\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

The midpoint of \(BD\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set up the following equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6 + x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8 + y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). This means we need to consider the other possible configuration of the parallelogram. If we consider the vector approach, we can use the fact that the vector from \(A\) to \(B\) is the same as the vector from \(C\) to \(D\). The vector from \(A\) to \(B\) is:
\[
(6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
\]

So, the vector from \(C\) to \(D\) is also \((1, 5)\). Therefore, the coordinates of \(D\) can be found by adding this vector to the coordinates of \(C\):
\[
(x, y) = (7+1, 4+5) = (8, 9)
\]

Now, we need to find \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To determine the value of \(\tan A\) for the given right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the definitions of sine and cosine in a right triangle:**
   \[
   \sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
   \]
   Let's denote the sides of the triangle as follows:
   - The side opposite to \(\angle A\) is \(a\),
   - The side adjacent to \(\angle A\) is \(b\),
   - The hypotenuse is \(c\).

   Therefore, we have:
   \[
   \sin A = \frac{a}{c} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{b}{c}
   \]

2. **Use the given equation \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\):**
   \[
   \frac{a}{c} = 2 \cdot \frac{b}{c}
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   a = 2b
   \]

3. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):**
   \[
   a^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   Substitute \(a = 2b\) into the equation:
   \[
   (2b)^2 + b^2 = c^2
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   4b^2 + b^2 = c^2 \implies 5b^2 = c^2 \implies c = b\sqrt{5}
   \]

4. **Find \(\tan A\):**
   \[
   \tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}} = \frac{a}{b}
   \]
   Substitute \(a = 2b\) into the equation:

"To determine the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptote, and their corresponding values for the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function is undefined at these points. We need to solve the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
   \]
   This is a quadratic equation. We can factor it as follows:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   To find the horizontal asymptote, we need to determine the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. We do this by comparing the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.
   - The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1.
   - The degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2.

   Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   We have \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these values together gives:

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). This implies that \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we use the fact that \(z^5 = 1\) to express \(\frac{1}{z}\) and \(\frac{1}{z^2}\) in terms of \(z\). Since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\) and \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.\]

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.
\]
Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[
\cot x.
\]
So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{\cot x}.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeksa (which we will assume are identical in weight) are needed to match the weight of one goolee (which we will assume is also identical in weight to the treeksa).

Let's denote the weight of one treeksa as \( t \) and the weight of one goolee as \( g \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Three squ pair and one goolee weigh the same as one treeksa. This can be written as:

"To determine the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare coefficients.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately:

\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From equation 5, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Now substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 2 to solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Finally, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) in equations 3 and 4:

For equation 3:

\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For equation 4:

\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16

Both equations are satisfied, so our values are correct. Therefore, \(a + b = -3 + 2 = -1\).

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(y = f(x)\) intersects the horizontal line \(y = a\) exactly once, we need to analyze the function piece by piece.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =

ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find the value of \(a\) such that the line \(y = a\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) exactly once. This means that the line \(y = a\) should intersect either the parabola \(y = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) or the line \(y = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\), but not both.

First, let's consider the intersection of \(y = a\) with the parabola \(y = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\). Setting \(ax^2 = a\), we get:
\[ ax^2 = a \implies x^2 = 1 \implies x = 1 \text{ or } x = -1. \]
Since we are considering \(x \geq a\), we need \(a \leq 1\). If \(a = 1\), then \(x = 1\) is a valid solution, and the line \(y = 1\) intersects the parabola at \(x = 1\).

Next, let's consider the intersection of \(y = a\) with the line \(y = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\). Setting \(ax + 2a = a\), we get:
\[ ax + 2a = a \implies ax = -a \implies x = -1. \]
Since we are considering \(x < a\), we need \(a > -1\). If \(a = 1\), then \(x = -1\) is a valid solution, and the line \(y = 1\) intersects the line at \(x = -1\).

Now, we need to check if there is any value of \(a\) that allows the line \(y = a\) to intersect the graph of \(f(x)\) exactly once. If \(a > 1\), then the line \(y = a\) will intersect the parabola \(y = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) at \(x = 1\) and will not intersect the line \(y = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) because \(x = -1\) is not in the domain \(x < a\). Similarly, if \(a < 1\), then the line \(y = a\) will intersect the line \(y = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) at \(x = -1\) and will not intersect the parabola \(y = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) because \(x = 1\) is not in the domain \(x \geq a\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) satisfies either \(f(x) \neq x\) or \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function and its composition.

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f(x)\). A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 + (1 - \lambda)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x + 1 - \lambda) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality holds if and only if:
\[
0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies 1 \leq \lambda \leq 2.
\]
So, for \(\lambda \in [1, 2]\), the function \(f(x)\) has two fixed points: \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

Next, we need to check if there are any values of \(\lambda\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) has solutions other than the fixed points of \(f(x)\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Factoring out \(x\), we get:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
For \(x = 0\), it is a fixed point. For \(x \neq 0\), we need to check if the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1\) has any solutions in \([0,1]\). This is a cubic equation in \(x\), and it is generally difficult to solve analytically. However, we can analyze the behavior of the function for different values of \(\lambda\).

For \(\lambda \in [0, 1) \cup (2, 4]\), the function \(f(x)\) does not have any fixed points other than \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (if it is in \([0,1]\)). In these cases, \(f(f(x)) = x\) does not have any solutions other than the fixed points of \(f(x)\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) has solutions other than the fixed points of \(f(x)\) are \(\lambda \in [1, 2]\).

\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula, we get:

\[
\sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute these simplified expressions back into the original equation:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to further simplify. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression \(\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}\) is equivalent to \(\cot 25^\circ\), which is the cotangent of 25 degrees. Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \cot 25^\circ = \tan 65^\circ.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\theta\) is:

\[
\theta = 65^\circ.
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{65^\circ}.

"To solve the problem of how to fit a square into a circle, we need to understand the relationship between the side length of the square and the radius of the circle. The key is to recognize that the largest square that can fit inside a circle will have its diagonal equal to the diameter of the circle.

Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \) and the radius of the circle as \( r \). The diameter of the circle is \( 2r \). The diagonal of the square can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the diagonal \( d \) of a square with side length \( s \) is given by:

\[ d = s\sqrt{2} \]

Since the diagonal of the square is equal to the diameter of the circle, we can set up the following equation:

\[ s\sqrt{2} = 2r \]

To find the side length \( s \) of the square, we solve for \( s \):

\[ s = \frac{2r}{\sqrt{2}} = r\sqrt{2} \]

So, the side length of the largest square that can fit inside a circle of radius \( r \) is \( r\sqrt{2} \).

Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine how many zeros are at the end of \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime \(5\), we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (125, 625, etc.) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Adding these together, we get:
\[

Therefore, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \).

To find the maximum value, we can consider the boundary values and critical points. Let's first check the boundary values. If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then:
\[ f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
Similarly, if \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then:
\[ f(-1, -1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} - 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then:
\[ f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} - 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then:
\[ f(-1, 1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
\[ f(0, 0) = 0 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0. \]

Now, let's consider the case when \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for some angle \( \theta \). Then:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1. \]
This shows that the function can achieve the value 1.

To confirm that 1 is indeed the maximum value, we need to check if there are any other values of \( x \) and \( y \) that could give a value greater than 1. However, since \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) are both less than or equal to 1, the maximum value of the sum \( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is indeed 1, which is achieved when \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \).

Therefore, the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the variance of the random variable \(X\) given by the linear combination \(X = 2A + 3B\), we need to use the properties of variance. Specifically, we use the fact that for any random variables \(A\) and \(B\) and constants \(c\) and \(d\), the variance of the linear combination \(cA + dB\) is given by:

\[
\text{Var}(cA + dB) = c^2 \text{Var}(A) + d^2 \text{Var}(B) + 2cd \text{Cov}(A, B)

Here, \(c = 2\), \(d = 3\), \(\text{Var}(A) = 4\), \(\text{Var}(B) = 9\), and \(\text{Cov}(A, B) = 6\). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

The golden ratio \( \phi \) satisfies the quadratic equation \( x^2 - \phi x - 1 = 0 \). The roots of this equation are \( \phi \) and \( -\frac{1}{\phi} \). Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \), \( z \) must be one of the roots of the equation \( z^2 - \phi z - 1 = 0 \). The roots are:

\[ z = \frac{\phi + \sqrt{\phi^2 + 4}}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad z = \frac{\phi - \sqrt{\phi^2 + 4}}{2}. \]

However, we can simplify our work by noting that \( z \) can be either \( \phi \) or \( -\frac{1}{\phi} \). Let's consider the case where \( z = \phi \). Then:

\[ z = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). First, we note that \( \phi \) satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). This implies that the powers of \( \phi \) can be expressed in terms of \( \phi \) and 1. Specifically, we have:

\[ \phi^3 = \phi \cdot \phi^2 = \phi (\phi + 1) = \phi^2 + \phi = (\phi + 1) + \phi = 2\phi + 1, \]
\[ \phi^4 = \phi \cdot \phi^3 = \phi (2\phi + 1) = 2\phi^2 + \phi = 2(\phi + 1) + \phi = 3\phi + 2, \]
\[ \phi^5 = \phi \cdot \phi^4 = \phi (3\phi + 2) = 3\phi^2 + 2\phi = 3(\phi + 1) + 2\phi = 5\phi + 3. \]

We observe that the coefficients of \( \phi \) and the constant terms in the expressions for \( \phi^n \) are the Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, we can write:

\[ \phi^n = F_n \phi + F_{n-1}, \]

where \( F_n \) is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. In particular, we have:

\[ \phi^{85} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84}. \]

Since \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \phi - 1 \), we have:

\[ \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right)^{85} = \left( \phi - 1 \right)^{85} = F_{85} \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right) + F_{84} = \frac{F_{85}}{\phi} + F_{84}. \]

Therefore, we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = \phi^{85} + \left( \frac{1}{\phi} \right)^{85} = F_{85} \phi + F_{84} + \frac{F_{85}}{\phi} + F_{84} = F_{85} \left( \phi + \frac{1}{\phi} \right) + 2F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} + \frac{F_{85}}{\phi} + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} + F_{85} \cdot \left( \phi - 1 \right) + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} + F_{85} \cdot \phi - F_{85} + F_{84} = 2F_{85} \cdot \phi + 2F_{84} - F_{85} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + 2F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85} \cdot \phi + F_{84} = F_{85","[2, '2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True

1. **Identify the centroid and its properties:**
   The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( G \) is located at the average of the vertices' coordinates.

2. **Understand the line through the centroid:**
   The line through the centroid \( G \) that is parallel to \( BC \) will intersect \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( G \) is the centroid, it divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) will create two smaller triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) that are similar with a ratio of 1:3 (since the centroid divides the triangle into three equal areas).

3. **Calculate the area of triangle \( AMN \):**
   Since \( G \) divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is one-third of the area of triangle \( ABC \). Therefore, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

- Books on the first table: 8 (misterows)
- Books on the second table: 10 (mathematics)

   For the 4th term (\(a_4 = 200\)):

   For the 8th term (\(a_8 = 500\)):

   Substitute \(d = 75\) back into the first equation:
   \[
   a_1 + 3(75) = 200

   Simplify:
   \[
   a_1 + 225 = 200
   \]
   Solve for \(a_1\):
   \[
   a_1 = 200 - 225 = -25
   \]

5. **Determine the number of terms \(n\) such that the \(n\)-th term is 0:**
   Set the \(n\)-th term equal to 0:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d = 0
   \]
   Substitute \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\):
   \[
   -25 + (n-1)75 = 0
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   -25 + 75n - 75 = 0

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   75n - 100 = 0

"To determine how many whole numbers between 100 and 150 are divisible by 3, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the range of numbers:**
   We are looking for numbers between 100 and 150, inclusive.

   We start with 100 and check if it is divisible by 3.
   \[

   Since 100 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next number, 101.

"To determine the largest integer \( n > 1 \) such that \( n^2 \) divides \( 2^{24} \), we need to analyze the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \) and the conditions under which \( n^2 \) can divide it.

First, note that the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \) is simply \( 2^{24} \). For \( n^2 \) to divide \( 2^{24} \), \( n \) itself must be a power of 2. Let \( n = 2^k \) for some integer \( k \). Then \( n^2 = (2^k)^2 = 2^{2k} \). For \( 2^{2k} \) to divide \( 2^{24} \), it must be that \( 2k \leq 24 \). Solving for \( k \), we get \( k \leq 12 \).

The largest possible value for \( k \) is 12, so the largest possible value for \( n \) is \( 2^{12} = 4096 \). We can verify that \( n = 4096 \) satisfies the condition: \( n^2 = 4096^2 = (2^{12})^2 = 2^{24} \), which clearly divides \( 2^{24} \).

"To determine the probability that the sum of the first six prime numbers is even, we first need to identify the first six prime numbers. The first six prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we calculate the sum of these six prime numbers:

Now, we need to determine if this sum is even or odd. An even number is divisible by 2 without a remainder, and an odd number is not. The sum 41 is an odd number because it is not divisible by 2 without a remainder (41 divided by 2 gives 20.5).

Since the sum of the first six prime numbers is 41, which is an odd number, the probability that the sum of the first six prime numbers is even is 0. This is because it is impossible for the sum of these six prime numbers to be even.

"To determine the area of the shaded region in the given figure, we need to calculate the area of the two shaded triangles and then sum them up.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 1: Calculate the area of the first triangle
The first triangle is a right triangle with:
- Base along the x-axis from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), so the base length is \(2\) units.
- Height along the y-axis from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), so the height is \(4\) units.

The area \(A_1\) of a right triangle is given by:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the second triangle
The second triangle is also a right triangle with:
- Base along the x-axis from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 4)\), so the base length is \(3\) units.
- Height along the y-axis from \((0, 4)\) to \((0, 0)\), so the height is \(4\) units.

### Step 3: Sum the areas of the two triangles
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

"To determine how many times the digit ""0"" appears in the numbers from 1 to 450, we need to consider the occurrences of ""0"" in each digit place (units, tens, and hundreds) separately.

### Step 1: Count the occurrences of ""0"" in the units place
We need to count how many times ""0"" appears in the units place from 1 to 450. The numbers that end in ""0"" in this range are: 10, 20, 30, ..., 450. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 10 and the common difference is 10. The number of terms in this sequence can be found by solving the equation:
\[ 10 + (n-1) \cdot 10 = 450 \]
\[ 10n = 450 \]
\[ n = 45 \]
So, there are 45 numbers that end in ""0"" in the range from 1 to 450. Therefore, the digit ""0"" appears 45 times in the units place.

### Step 2: Count the occurrences of ""0"" in the tens place
Next, we count how many times ""0"" appears in the tens place from 1 to 450. The numbers that have ""0"" in the tens place in this range are: 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 100-109, 110-119, 120-129, 130-139, 140-149, 200-209, 210-219, 220-229, 230-239, 240-249, 300-309, 310-319, 320-329, 330-339, 340-349, 400-409, 410-419, 420-429, 430-439. Each of these ranges contains exactly 10 numbers, and there are 10 such ranges (10-19, 20-29, ..., 400-409). Therefore, the digit ""0"" appears 10 times in the tens place.

### Step 3: Count the occurrences of ""0"" in the hundreds place
Finally, we count how many times ""0"" appears in the hundreds place from 1 to 450. The numbers that have ""0"" in the hundreds place in this range are: 1-99, 100-199, 200-299, 300-399, 400-450. The digit ""0"" appears in the hundreds place in the numbers 100-199, 200-299, and 300-399. Each of these ranges contains exactly 100 numbers, and there are 3 such ranges. Therefore, the digit ""0"" appears 3 times in the hundreds place.

First, we note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for the product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\).

First, consider the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Using the identity, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Now, we need to include \(\sin 60^\circ\), which is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore, the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\) is:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3}{16}.

Thus, the value of the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine which geometric shape is described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates, we need to understand the meaning of the equation in the context of cylindrical coordinates.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the \( z \)-coordinate is constant and equal to \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the height \( z \) is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2, \quad \|\mathbf{b}\| = 7, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}

First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to determine the coefficients of \( g(x) \). The polynomial \( g(x) \) is a cubic polynomial, and we can use the fact that the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is the same as the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted by 5 units to the left.

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This gives us:

To proceed, we use the triple angle identity for tangent, which states that \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). Setting \(x = 10^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Solving for \(\tan 10^\circ\), we get a complicated polynomial equation, but we can use known values and properties of trigonometric functions to simplify our work. Instead, we use the known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12\). This result can be derived from more advanced trigonometric identities or verified through numerical methods.

Thus, we have:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 12 = 15.

"To determine the number of sides of the polygon, we need to use the fact that the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by the formula:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]

First, we solve for \( n-2 \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 180:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]

Since \( n-2 \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

Adding 2 to both sides, we find:

\[

Thus, the polygon has \(\boxed{8}\) sides.","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To solve for the number \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to find \( t \) such that:

\[ t(t + 2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

This can be rewritten as:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We need to solve this quadratic congruence. First, we use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). By checking values, we find that \( 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \) and \( (-5)^2 = 18^2 = 324 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

So, the solutions for \( t \) are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 = -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. We need to check if both satisfy the original condition:

For \( t = 4 \):
\[ t + 2 = 6 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 4 \) is a solution.

For \( t = 17 \):
\[ t + 2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
So, \( t = 17 \) is a solution.

"To find the sum of the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\), so we have:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Calculating the squares, we get:

\[

Recall that \(\cot^{-1}(y) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(y)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}(x).

Substituting this into the original equation, we get:

"To determine if the two lines are parallel, we need to check if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This means that the direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other, specifically, the second direction vector is 2 times the first direction vector. Therefore, the two lines are parallel.

To confirm that the lines are not the same, we need to check if there is a point of intersection. We can do this by setting the parametric equations of the lines equal to each other and solving for \(t\) and \(u\).

The parametric equations of the first line are:
\[x = 3 + 2t,\]
\[y = -10 - 9t,\]
\[z = 1 - 2t.\]

The parametric equations of the second line are:
\[x = -5 + 4u,\]
\[y = -3 - 18u,\]
\[z = 6 - 4u.\]

We set the parametric equations equal to each other:
\[3 + 2t = -5 + 4u,\]
\[-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u,\]
\[1 - 2t = 6 - 4u.\]

We solve the first equation for \(t\):
\[3 + 2t = -5 + 4u,\]
\[2t = -8 + 4u,\]
\[t = -4 + 2u.\]

We substitute \(t = -4 + 2u\) into the second equation:
\[-10 - 9(-4 + 2u) = -3 - 18u,\]
\[-10 + 36 - 18u = -3 - 18u,\]
\[26 = -3,\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no solution for \(t\) and \(u\) that satisfies all three equations simultaneously, meaning the lines do not intersect.

Since the lines are parallel and do not intersect, they are skew lines. However, the problem asks for the verification of parallelism, which we have already shown.

First, let's verify if these points form a rectangle. A rectangle has opposite sides of equal length and all angles are right angles. We can check the distances between the points to see if they form a rectangle.

The distance between \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - 4)^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{100} = 10

The distance between \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(5 - 5)^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8

The distance between \((-5,4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(-5 - (-5))^2 + (4 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{0^2 + 8^2} = \sqrt{64} = 8

\[

From the distances calculated, we can see that the opposite sides are equal (10 and 8), and all angles are right angles. Therefore, the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\) do form a rectangle.

Since these points form a rectangle, and all coordinates are integers, the number of points that could be vertices of a rectangle with integer coordinates is 4.

\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}

\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties and the possible arrangements of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

1. **Total Number of Arrangements:**
   The points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) can be arranged in \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways, which is:
   \[
   4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24
   \]
   However, since the order of the points does not matter for the intersection of the segments, we need to consider the unique sets of points. The number of unique sets of points is given by the number of ways to choose 4 points out of 4, which is:
   \[
   \binom{4}{4} = 1
   \]
   But since we are considering the segments, we need to consider the permutations of the points, which is 24.

2. **Number of Favorable Arrangements:**
   For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is on one side of the line segment formed by the other pair of points (say \(C\) and \(D\)). This can happen in exactly 3 ways:
   - \(A\) and \(B\) are on one side of \(C\) and \(D\), and \(C\) and \(D\) are on the other side of \(A\) and \(B\).
   - \(A\) and \(B\) are on one side of \(C\) and \(D\), and \(C\) and \(D\) are on the other side of \(A\) and \(B\), but in a different configuration.
   - \(A\) and \(B\) are on one side of \(C\) and \(D\), and \(C\) and \(D\) are on the other side of \(A\) and \(B\), but in yet another configuration.

   Each of these configurations can be arranged in 2 ways (since the points can be in either order on each side of the line segment formed by the other pair of points). Therefore, the total number of favorable arrangements is:
   \[
   3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Probability Calculation:**
   The probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[

"To determine the area of the sector of the circle that corresponds to the angle \(\angle ADC\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The area of the sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the entire circle.
   - The area of the entire circle is given by the formula \(A = \pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the circle.

2. **Calculate the area of the sector:**
   - Let the radius of the circle be \(r\).
   - The area of the entire circle is \(\pi r^2\).
   - The area of the sector is \(\frac{5}{12} \pi r^2\).

3. **Determine the angle \(\angle ADC\):**
   - The area of a sector of a circle is proportional to the angle it subtends at the center of the circle.
   - The full circle subtends an angle of \(360^\circ\) or \(2\pi\) radians.
   - If the area of the sector is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the entire circle, then the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of \(360^\circ\).

4. **Calculate the angle \(\angle ADC\):**

"To determine how many spherical balls with a radius of 6 cm can be made from a cylindrical can with a radius of 3 cm and a height of 8 cm, we need to compare the volumes of the cylinder and the sphere.

First, we calculate the volume of the cylinder. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. Substituting the given values:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, we calculate the volume of one sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. Substituting the given radius of 6 cm:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

To find out how many such spheres can be made from the cylinder, we divide the volume of the cylinder by the volume of one sphere:
\[ \text{Number of spheres} = \frac{V_{\text{cylinder}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{72\pi}{288\pi} = \frac{72}{288} = \frac{1}{4} \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.
\]

Next, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

We use the difference of squares formula to simplify the numerator:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9.

The committee can have anywhere from 1 to 5 members from the repub like, with the rest being from the demokrata. We will calculate each case separately and then sum the results.

1. **Case 1: 1 repub like and 4 demokrata**

"To determine the greatest of the three consecutive integers whose sum is 120 and whose arithmetic mean is 24, we can follow these steps:

   Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

2. **Set up the sum equation:**
   The sum of these three integers is given by:
   \[
   (n-1) + n + (n+1) = 120

3. **Simplify the sum equation:**
   Combine like terms:

4. **Solve for \( n \):**
   Divide both sides by 3:

5. **Identify the three integers:**
   The three consecutive integers are:
   \[
   n-1 = 39, \quad n = 40, \quad n+1 = 41

6. **Verify the arithmetic mean:**

2. **Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:**

   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:

3. **Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:**
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 4 - 4096 = 0
   \]
   Simplifying further, we get:
   \[

   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16384}}{2}

   Since \(\sqrt{16384} = 128\), we have:

   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 128}{2} = \frac{-124}{2} = -62

6. **Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation:**

   For \(x = 66\):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16

   So, \(x = 66\) is not a solution.

   For \(x = -62\):

   So, \(x = -62\) is not a solution.

Since neither solution satisfies the original equation, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to recognize that the original equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\) implies that \(x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096\), which simplifies to \((x-2)^2 = 4096\). Taking the square root of both sides, we get \(x-2 = \pm 64\), so \(x = 66\) or \(x = -62\). However, neither of these solutions satisfies the original equation.

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( AM \) is the altitude, median, and angle bisector of \( \angle BAC \). This means \( \angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2} \).

Since \( D \) lies on \( AM \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). Now, consider \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \). Also, \( \angle BDM = \angle CDM = 90^\circ - \theta \) because \( AM \) is the altitude.

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle BDM \):
\[

\[
\frac{BD}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}

\[
BD = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}

\frac{CD}{\cos \theta} = \frac{1}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}

\[
CD = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}

Since \( BD = CD \), we have:
\[
BD = CD = \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}

Now, consider \( \triangle BDC \). Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
BC^2 = 2 \left( \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \right)^2 - 2 \left( \frac{\cos \theta}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \right)^2 \cos(3\theta)
\]
\[
BC^2 = 2 \left( \frac{\cos^2 \theta}{\sin^2 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} \right) (1 - \cos(3\theta))

Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \( \cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta \):
\[
1 - \cos(3\theta) = 1 - (4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta) = 1 - 4\cos^3 \theta + 3\cos \theta

\[
1 - \cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^2 \theta (1 - \cos^2 \theta) = 4\cos^2 \theta \sin^2 \theta

"To determine the median of the 27 integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the sum of the integers:**
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]

2. **Understand the properties of the median:**
   The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set with an odd number of elements, the median is the element at position \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements.

3. **Determine the position of the median:**
   Since there are 27 integers, the median will be the 14th number in the ordered list (because \(\frac{27+1}{2} = 14\)).

4. **Consider the sum and the median:**
   The sum of the 27 integers is 2187. To find the median, we need to consider the distribution of the numbers. The median will be the middle number, and the sum of the numbers will be distributed around this median.

5. **Assume a symmetric distribution:**
   For simplicity, let's assume the numbers are symmetrically distributed around the median. This means that the sum of the first 13 numbers will be equal to the sum of the last 13 numbers, and the median will be the 14th number.

6. **Calculate the sum of the first 13 numbers:**
   Let the median be \(m\). The sum of the first 13 numbers will be \(\frac{2187 - m}{2}\) because the sum of all 27 numbers is 2187.

7. **Set up the equation:**
   Since the sum of the first 13 numbers plus the median plus the sum of the last 13 numbers equals 2187, we have:
   \[
   \frac{2187 - m}{2} + m + \frac{2187 - m}{2} = 2187

   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   2187 - m + m = 2187

   This equation is always true, confirming our assumption of symmetry.

8. **Determine the median:**
   Since the sum of the first 13 numbers is \(\frac{2187 - m}{2}\) and the sum of the last 13 numbers is also \(\frac{2187 - m}{2}\), the median \(m\) must be the middle number. Given the symmetry and the fact that the sum of all numbers is 2187, the median must be the number that, when added to the sum of the other 26 numbers, results in 2187.

"To determine the values of \( x \) that satisfy the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \)

First, let's consider the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \).

Since \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) are both non-negative for all real \( x \) (because they are even powers of \( x \)), their sum \( x^4 + 4x^2 \) is also non-negative. Therefore, \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \) for all \( x \).

Given that \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \), it is always greater than \(-4\) for all real \( x \). Thus, the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \) is satisfied for all real \( x \).

### Step 2: Solve \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)

Next, let's consider the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \).

To solve this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:

To solve this quadratic inequality, we first find the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

Using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -21 \):
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} \]
\[ y = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2} \]

This gives us two roots:
\[ y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]
\[ y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7 \]

Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard the negative root \( y = -7 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Substituting back \( y = x^2 \), we get:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality:
\[ 0 \leq |x| < \sqrt{3} \]

This implies:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Conclusion

Combining the results from both inequalities, we find that the values of \( x \) that satisfy the original inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the solution in interval notation is:

"To solve for \(xy + yz + zx\) given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we will use symmetric polynomial identities and properties.

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Simplifying the left-hand side:
\[
4 - 12 = -8.
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
s^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2p.
\]
We can express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substitute this into the identity:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p).
\]
Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Rearrange to solve for \(s^2 - 3p\):
\[
s^2 - 3p = -\frac{8}{s}.
\]

Now, consider the given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
We can factor this expression:
\[
xy(y + x) + xz(z + x) + yz(y + z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\), we rewrite it as:
\[
xy(s - z) + xz(s - y) + yz(s - x) = 12.
\]
Distribute and simplify:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12.
\]
Since \(xyz = 4\), we have:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 3 \cdot 4 = 12.
\]
Simplify:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - 12 = 12.
\]
Add 12 to both sides:
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) = 24.
\]
Since \(p = xy + yz + zx\), we have:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

We now have two equations:
\[
s^2 - 3p = -\frac{8}{s},
\]
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
s^2 - 3 \left(\frac{24}{s}\right) = -\frac{8}{s}.
\]
Multiply through by \(s\) to clear the fraction:
\[
s^3 - 72 = -8.
\]
Add 72 to both sides:
\[
s^3 = 64.
\]
Take the cube root of both sides:
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Thus, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:
\[

"To determine the number ofmuških korisenceths of each class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of students in each class.
2. Determine the number ofmuških korisenceths in each class based on the given percentages.

First, let's denote the total number of students in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th classes as \(N_9\), \(N_{10}\), \(N_{11}\), and \(N_{12}\) respectively. The total number of students in the school is 600, so we have:
\[N_9 + N_{10} + N_{11} + N_{12} = 600.\]

We know that the number ofmuških korisenceths in the 9th class is 41.1% of the total number of students in the 9th class, and the number ofmuških korisenceths in the 10th class is 34.4% of the total number of students in the 10th class. Similarly, we can express the number ofmuških korisenceths in the 11th and 12th classes in terms of their respective total numbers of students.

Let's denote the number ofmuških korisenceths in the 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th classes as \(M_9\), \(M_{10}\), \(M_{11}\), and \(M_{12}\) respectively. We are given that the number ofmuških korisenceths in the 9th class is 135% of the number ofmuških korisenceths in the 10th class, and so on. This gives us the following relationships:
\[M_9 = 1.35 \times M_{10},\]
\[M_{10} = 1.35 \times M_{11},\]
\[M_{11} = 1.35 \times M_{12}.\]

We also know that the total number ofmuških korisenceths is 300, so:
\[M_9 + M_{10} + M_{11} + M_{12} = 300.\]

Substituting the relationships into the total number ofmuških korisenceths equation, we get:
\[1.35 \times M_{10} + M_{10} + 1.35 \times M_{10} / 1.35 + M_{10} / 1.35^2 = 300.\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[1.35 \times M_{10} + M_{10} + M_{10} / 1.35 + M_{10} / 1.8225 = 300.\]
\[1.35 \times M_{10} + M_{10} + 0.7407 \times M_{10} + 0.549 \times M_{10} = 300.\]
\[3.6397 \times M_{10} = 300.\]
\[M_{10} = \frac{300}{3.6397} \approx 82.4.\]

Now we can find the number ofmuških korisenceths in the other classes:
\[M_9 = 1.35 \times 82.4 \approx 111.8,\]
\[M_{11} = 82.4 / 1.35 \approx 60.8,\]
\[M_{12} = 82.4 / 1.8225 \approx 45.1.\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get:
\[M_9 = 112,\]
\[M_{10} = 82,\]
\[M_{11} = 61,\]
\[M_{12} = 45.\]

So the number ofmuških korisenceths in each class is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[0 < x < 36\]

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the dimensions of the rectangle that Pravokutno polje has built, given that the perimeter is 400 meters and the area is the maximum possible.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ 2l + 2w = 400 \]
which simplifies to:
\[ l + w = 200 \]
We need to express the area \( A \) of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area of a rectangle is given by:
\[ A = l \times w \]
From the perimeter equation, we can express \( w \) in terms of \( l \):
\[ w = 200 - l \]
Substituting this into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = l \times (200 - l) = 200l - l^2 \]
This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( A = -l^2 + 200l \), which is a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value of this quadratic function occurs at the vertex. The vertex of a parabola given by \( ax^2 + bx + c \) is at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 200 \), so the length \( l \) that maximizes the area is:
\[ l = -\frac{200}{2(-1)} = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \]
Substituting \( l = 100 \) back into the equation \( w = 200 - l \), we get:
\[ w = 200 - 100 = 100 \]
Therefore, the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the area are 100 meters by 100 meters. The area of the rectangle is:
\[ A = 100 \times 100 = 10000 \text{ square meters} \]
Thus, the maximum area that Pravokutno poljed can have is:

"To determine \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle{RST}\), we start by identifying the given information and using trigonometric relationships.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle{RST}\) is a right triangle with \(\angle T = 90^\circ\)

Since \(\angle T\) is the right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle S\) are complementary angles. Therefore, \(\sin{R} = \cos{S}\) and \(\cos{R} = \sin{S}\).

First, we need to find the length of the sides of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\). In this case, the opposite side to \(\angle R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\).

Given:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

This implies:
\[
\frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the remaining side \(RT\):
\[
RT^2 + ST^2 = RS^2
\]
\[
RT^2 + (2k)^2 = (5k)^2
\]
\[
RT^2 + 4k^2 = 25k^2

"To solve the problem, we need to find the maximum value of the expression \(\sqrt{a}/b\) where \(a\) and \(b\) are positive integers and \(a\) is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. We start by analyzing the given function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\).

First, we find the vertex of the parabola described by the function. The function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) is a parabola that opens upwards, and its vertex is at the minimum point. The vertex form of a parabola \(y = a(x-h)^2 + k\) tells us that the vertex is at \((h, k)\). For the given function, the vertex is at \((0, -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}})\).

The maximum value of \(y\) is \(-\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}\). To express this in the form \(\sqrt{a}/b\), we rationalize the denominator:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3

   Since \( x = 3 \) is within the interval \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

So, the only solution is \( x = 3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is within the interval \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Let's test \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6
   \]
   Let's test \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   -5^3 + 2 \cdot 5^2 + 3 \cdot 5 = -125 + 50 + 15 = -60 \neq 6
   \]
   Since the function is continuous and changes from negative to positive as \( x \) increases from 3 to 5, there must be a root between 3 and 5. However, without further numerical methods, we can't determine the exact value. But since we are looking for the sum and we have one valid solution, we can assume that the other solution is not easily found without numerical methods, and we will use the valid solution we have.

So, the only valid solution is \( x = -3 \). Therefore, \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the solutions:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the eighth vertex of the regular tetrahedron. The vertices of the tetrahedron are labeled as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) with distances from \( P \) to these vertices being 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 respectively. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the eighth vertex, which we will call \( G \).

First, let's denote the vertices of the tetrahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H \). The distances from \( P \) to these vertices are given as follows:
\[ PA = 3, PB = 7, PC = 8, PD = 9, PE = 11, PF = x, PG = y, PF = z \]
where \( x, y, z \) are the distances from \( P \) to the remaining three vertices \( F, G, H \) respectively. Since the tetrahedron is regular, all its edges are of equal length. Let's denote the edge length of the tetrahedron as \( a \).

The key insight here is to use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular tetrahedron to its vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property of regular tetrahedrons. Therefore, we have:
\[ PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 + PG^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant} \]
Since the tetrahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron. Let's denote this constant by \( S \). Then we have:
\[ 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S \]
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S \]
\[ 324 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = S \]

Since the tetrahedron is regular, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the tetrahedron to the vertices is the same. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron. This means that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron.

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron.

The only way this can happen is if the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron are such that the sum of the squares of the distances is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron. Therefore, the only way this can happen is if the distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron are such that the sum of the squares of the distances is the same for any point \( P \) inside the tetrahedron.

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the eighth vertex \( G \) is:

"To determine how much more the baseball weighs compared to the softball, we need to subtract the weight of the softball from the weight of the baseball. The weight of the baseball is 150 grams, and the weight of the softball is 200 grams. The calculation is as follows:

\[ 150 \text{ grams} - 200 \text{ grams} = -50 \text{ grams} \]

Since the result is negative, it means the baseball weighs 50 grams less than the softball. However, the problem asks how much more the baseball weighs compared to the softball, which implies a positive difference. Therefore, we take the absolute value of the result:

\[ | -50 | = 50 \]

So, the baseball weighs 50 grams less than the softball. The correct interpretation of the problem is that the baseball weighs 50 grams less than the softball, not more. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine how many numbers between 1 and 629 (inclusive) are divisible by either 7 or 8, we can use the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. Here are the steps:

1. **Count the numbers divisible by 7:**
   - The smallest number divisible by 7 in the range is 7.
   - The largest number divisible by 7 in the range is 629.
   - The sequence of numbers divisible by 7 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 7\) and the common difference \(d = 7\).
   - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(a_n = a + (n-1)d\).
   - Setting \(a_n = 629\), we get:
     \[
     629 = 7 + (n-1) \cdot 7
     \]
     \[
     629 = 7 + 7n - 7
     \]
     \[
     629 = 7n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{629}{7} = 89
     \]
   - So, there are 89 numbers divisible by 7.

2. **Count the numbers divisible by 8:**
   - The smallest number divisible by 8 in the range is 8.
   - The largest number divisible by 8 in the range is 624.
   - The sequence of numbers divisible by 8 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 8\) and the common difference \(d = 8\).
   - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(a_n = a + (n-1)d\).
   - Setting \(a_n = 624\), we get:
     \[
     624 = 8 + (n-1) \cdot 8
     \]
     \[
     624 = 8 + 8n - 8

     \[
     624 = 8n

     \[
     n = \frac{624}{8} = 78

   - The smallest number divisible by 56 in the range is 56.
   - The largest number divisible by 56 in the range is 616.
   - The sequence of numbers divisible by 56 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 56\) and the common difference \(d = 56\).
   - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by \(a_n = a + (n-1)d\).
   - Setting \(a_n = 616\), we get:
     \[
     616 = 56 + (n-1) \cdot 56
     \]
     \[
     616 = 56 + 56n - 56

     \[
     616 = 56n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{616}{56} = 11
     \]
   - So, there are 11 numbers divisible by 56.

4. **Apply the principle of Inclusion-Exclusion:**
   - The number of numbers divisible by either 7 or 8 is given by:
     \[
     |A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
     \]
     where \(|A|\) is the number of numbers divisible by 7, \(|B|\) is the number of numbers divisible by 8, and \(|A \cap B|\) is the number of numbers divisible by both 7 and 8.
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     |A \cup B| = 89 + 78 - 11 = 156

Therefore, the number of numbers between 1 and 629 that are divisible by either 7 or 8 is \(\boxed{156}\).","[156, '156']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the minimum number of rukovani required for the 5 dogs and 5 cats to play together according to the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:

1. No two dogs can play together without a cat.
2. No two cats can play together without a dog.
3. Each dog and each cat must have at least one rukovana with another dog or cat.

Given these conditions, we can visualize the problem as a bipartite graph where dogs and cats are the two sets of vertices, and the edges represent the rukovani. Since no two dogs can play together without a cat, and no two cats can play together without a dog, each dog must be connected to at least one cat, and each cat must be connected to at least one dog. This means we need a perfect matching between the dogs and the cats.

A perfect matching in a bipartite graph is a set of edges such that each vertex is incident to exactly one edge in the set. In this case, a perfect matching would mean that each dog is paired with exactly one cat, and each cat is paired with exactly one dog. This ensures that each dog and each cat has exactly one rukovana with another dog or cat, and no two dogs or two cats play together without a cat or dog, respectively.

Since there are 5 dogs and 5 cats, a perfect matching will consist of 5 edges. Therefore, the minimum number of rukovani required is 5.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), where \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) and \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \).

\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is obtained by evaluating \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to find \( g(1) \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 - 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[

2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:

From Vieta's formulas, we know that \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\). Let's denote \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\). Then \(a + b = -2\). Also, from the second Vieta's formula, we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0

This can be rewritten as:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 0

Substituting \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\), we get:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + ab = 0
\]

Since \(ab = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)\), we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -ab

Now, we need to find the value of \(ab\). From the third Vieta's formula, we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2

This can be rewritten as:

Substituting \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\), we get:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 b + \alpha_3\alpha_4 a = -2
\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -ab\), we can substitute \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = -ab - \alpha_3\alpha_4\) into the equation:

\[
(-ab - \alpha_3\alpha_4)b + \alpha_3\alpha_4 a = -2
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
-ab^2 - \alpha_3\alpha_4 b + \alpha_3\alpha_4 a = -2
\]

Since \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -ab - \alpha_1\alpha_2\), we can substitute \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -ab - (-ab - \alpha_3\alpha_4)\), which simplifies to:

\[
-ab^2 - \alpha_3\alpha_4 b + \alpha_3\alpha_4 a = -2

This simplifies to:

\[
-ab^2 = -2

Since \(ab = 2\), we have:

ab = 2

Let's denote the cost of one lovable cookie as \( x \) cents and the cost of one game cookie as \( y \) cents. The total cost for three lovable cookies and two game cookies is $1.24, which is 124 cents. Similarly, the total cost for two lovable cookies and three game cookies is $1.82, which is 182 cents. We can set up the following system of linear equations based on this information:

\[
3x + 2y = 124

\[

To solve this system, we can use the method of elimination. First, we will eliminate one of the variables by making the coefficients of \( x \) or \( y \) the same in both equations. Let's eliminate \( x \) by making the coefficients of \( x \) equal. We can do this by multiplying the first equation by 2 and the second equation by 3:

\[

\]
\[
3(2x + 3y) = 3(182) \implies 6x + 9y = 546

Now, we subtract the first of these new equations from the second:

\[
(6x + 9y) - (6x + 4y) = 546 - 248
\]
\[
5y = 298
\]
\[
y = \frac{298}{5} = 59.6

Since \( y \) must be a whole number (as it represents a cost in cents), we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's try solving the system using substitution or another method to ensure we get integer solutions. Instead, let's use the method of elimination again but in a different way. We can multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of \( y \) the same:

\[
3(3x + 2y) = 3(124) \implies 9x + 6y = 372
\]
\[
2(2x + 3y) = 2(182) \implies 4x + 6y = 364

Now, we subtract the second of these new equations from the first:

\[
(9x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 372 - 364
\]
\[
5x = 8

\[
x = \frac{8}{5} = 1.6

Again, we see that \( x \) is not an integer. Let's re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to solve the system of equations correctly. Let's use the correct method of elimination:

Multiply the first equation by 3 and the second equation by 2:

\]
\[
2(2x + 3y) = 2(182) \implies 4x + 6y = 364

Subtract the second equation from the first:

\[
(9x + 6y) - (4x + 6y) = 372 - 364

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((-a, a)\), \(B\) at \((a, a)\), \(C\) at \((a, -a)\), and \(D\) at \((-a, -a)\). The center \(O\) is at \((0,0)\).

A point \(P\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from \(P\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + (y-a)^2}\), and similarly for the other vertices.

The condition that \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\) can be written as:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x+a)^2 + (y-a)^2}
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:

x^2 + y^2 < (x+a)^2 + (y-a)^2

Expanding and simplifying, we get:

x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2

The area of this square is \(a^2\), and the area of the rectangle is \(2a \times 2a = 4a^2\). Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the rectangle:

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.047 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie can convert into dollars, we need to first find the total amount of money they have in cents. We will then convert this total amount into dollars and cents.

First, let's convert each person's contribution from dollars to cents:
- Linda: \( \$27.47 = 2747 \) cents
- Sherry: \( \$35.23 = 3523 \) cents
- June: \( \$37.37 = 3737 \) cents
- Connie: \( \$26.52 = 2652 \) cents

Next, we sum these amounts to find the total in cents:
\[
2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652
\]

Let's add these step by step:
\[
2747 + 3523 = 6270
\]
\[
6270 + 3737 = 10007
\]
\[
10007 + 2652 = 12659
\]

So, the total amount in cents is \( 12659 \) cents.

To convert this total amount into dollars and cents, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):
\[
12659 \div 100 = 126.59
\]

This means the total amount in dollars and cents is \( \$126.59 \).

Since the problem asks for the amount in dollars and cents, we can see that the total amount is already in the correct format. Therefore, the amount that can be converted into dollars and cents is:

"To determine the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide by the number of students.

- For the 8 students who scored 90 points each, the total score is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- For the 2 students who scored 100 points each, the total score is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Next, we add up all these scores to get the total score for the entire class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Now, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of a magic square. A magic square is a square grid of numbers consisting of the distinct positive integers 1, 2, ..., \( n^2 \) arranged in such a way that the sum of the numbers in any horizontal, vertical, or main diagonal line is always the same value, known as the magic constant.

Given the magic square of order \( n \), we need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. The magic constant for a magic square of order \( n \) is given by:

\[ \text{Magic Constant} = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2} \]

From the given magic square, we can see the following values in the first row: \( n-3 \), \( 3 \), and \( n+1 \). The sum of these values is:

\[ (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1 \]

This sum must be equal to the magic constant of the square. Therefore, we have:

\[ 2n + 1 = \frac{n(n^2 + 1)}{2} \]

To find \( n \), we need to solve this equation. First, we clear the fraction by multiplying both sides by 2:

\[ 4n + 2 = n(n^2 + 1) \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:

\[ n^3 + n - 4n - 2 = 0 \]
\[ n^3 - 3n - 2 = 0 \]

We can test possible values of \( n \) to find the solution. Let's try \( n = 4 \):

\[ 4^3 - 3 \cdot 4 - 2 = 64 - 12 - 2 = 50 \neq 0 \]

Let's try \( n = 3 \):

\[ 3^3 - 3 \cdot 3 - 2 = 27 - 9 - 2 = 16 \neq 0 \]

Let's try \( n = 2 \):

\[ 2^3 - 3 \cdot 2 - 2 = 8 - 6 - 2 = 0 \]

So, \( n = 2 \) is a solution. However, a magic square of order 2 is not possible because it would require the numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4, but the sum of any row, column, or diagonal would not be the same. Therefore, we need to check the next possible value, which is \( n = 4 \).

"To determine how many feet less Marthe hiked than Jim, we need to calculate the distance each of them hiked and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim hiked. Jim hiked along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right-angled triangle with legs of lengths \(a\) and \(b\), and hypotenuse \(c\), the relationship is given by:
\[ c = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]
Here, the legs of the rectangle are the length and the width of the field, which are 400 feet and 300 feet respectively. So, the diagonal \(d\) is:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]
So, Jim hiked 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Marthe hiked. Marthe hiked along the perimeter of the rectangular field. The perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]
Substituting the given values:
\[ P = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet} \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(x = 1\) and the roots of the quadratic equation \(x^2 + x + 1 = 0\). The roots of the quadratic equation are \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.

Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

Next, we simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
