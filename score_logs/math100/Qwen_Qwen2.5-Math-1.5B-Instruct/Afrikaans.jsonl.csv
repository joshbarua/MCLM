"To solve for the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships in the triangle.

We are given:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(D\) as \(EF\) and the hypotenuse as \(DE\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DE\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DE} = 0.7
\]

Multiplying both sides by \(DE\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DE
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",\sqrt{51},[],False
"To find the complex number \( w \) when \( z \) is rotated by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in standard form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - 2) + (- (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i)
   \]
   \[
   z - c = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2} - 3)i
   \]
   \[
   z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( a + bi \) by \( \theta \) radians, we multiply it by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \):
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

   Multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \):
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)

   Use the distributive property:
   \[
   = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

4. **Translate back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the result:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   w = 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we are left with only prime factors.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 7, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this as:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11^2} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}.\]

"To determine the total number of pieces of cake that Op grand can eat, we need to follow these steps:

Now, let's perform the addition step by step:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (i.e., the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify the expression for \(T_k\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{3(5-k)} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine the powers of \(x\):

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 3k - 2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15 - 5k}
\]

For the term to be a constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{15 - 5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^0
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient \(\binom{5}{3}\):

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute \(\binom{5}{3} = 10\) into the expression:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[

"To determine the value of \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) modulo 7 when \(n \equiv 2 \pmod{7}\), we start by substituting \(n = 7k + 2\) for some integer \(k\). This substitution gives us:

\[
n + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[

Next, we reduce each of these expressions modulo 7:

\]
\[
n + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
n + 6 \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

\[

\]
\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 24 = 3 \cdot 7 + 3\text{)}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum number of grades required to form a word that can be read both left to right and right to left (a palindrome). Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the minimum number of grades ( letters ) required to form a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Example of a Palindrome**: Let's consider the word "" level"". It is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards. The word "" level "" has 5 letters.

3. **Generalizing the Solution**: To form a palindrome, the number of letters must be odd because the middle letter will be the same when read forwards or backwards. If the number of letters is even, the letters on the left and right of the middle will not match when read backwards.

4. **Conclusion**: The minimum number of letters required to form a palindrome is 1 (for the word ""a""), but since the problem asks for the minimum number of grades to form a word that can be read both ways and is not a single letter, the next smallest odd number is 3. The word "" level "" is an example of a palindrome with 5 letters, but the smallest non-trivial palindrome (with more than one letter) is "" level "" which has 5 letters.

Therefore, the minimum number of grades required to form a word that can be read both ways is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To determine the coordinates \((x, y)\) of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The diagonals of the parallelogram are \(AC\) and \(BD\). The midpoint of \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we can set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). This means we need to re-evaluate the problem with the correct interpretation of the coordinates. The correct interpretation should be that the fourth vertex \(D\) is such that the coordinates satisfy the properties of the parallelogram. Let's re-calculate with the correct interpretation:

The correct coordinates for the fourth vertex \(D\) should be such that the sum of the coordinates of the opposite vertices is equal. So, we have:
\[
5 + 7 = 6 + x \implies x = 9
\]
\[
3 + 4 = 8 + y \implies y = -1
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \(D\) are \((9, -1)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 9 + (-1) = 8
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"In a right-angled triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we are given that \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

First, recall the definitions of the trigonometric functions in a right-angled triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute the definitions of \(\sin A\) and \(\cos A\):
\[
\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}
\]
Let's denote the length of the adjacent side by \(x\). Then the length of the opposite side is \(2x\). The hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{x^2 + (2x)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 4x^2} = \sqrt{5x^2} = x\sqrt{5}
\]
Now, we can find \(\tan A\):
\[

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \), we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as the function becomes undefined at these points. We start by factoring the denominator:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14
\]

We factor this quadratic expression:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]

Setting the factored form equal to zero gives us the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero:

\[
(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
\]

Thus, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. We compare the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

The degree of the numerator \( 2x \) is 1, and the degree of the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

Thus, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
We have found that \( a = 7 \), \( b = -2 \), and \( c = 0 \). Adding these values together:

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) with respect to the Euclidean norm is given by the largest singular value of \( A \). The singular values of \( A \) are the square roots of the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \).

First, we compute \( A^T A \):
\[
A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are the solutions to the characteristic equation \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{17^2 - 4 \cdot 28}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}\), we get the eigenvalues:
\[
\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}, \quad \lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). This implies that \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, we use the fact that \(z^5 = 1\) to express \(\frac{1}{z}\) and \(\frac{1}{z^2}\) in terms of \(z\). Since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\) and \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.\]

\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, the expression becomes:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we need a common denominator for the two fractions. The common denominator is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with this common denominator:
\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now, the expression is:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Since the denominators are the same, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Recall that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[

\]

So, the final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks are equivalent to one squig. Let's break it down step by step.

1. We know from the problem statement that three treeks are equivalent to one goolee. This can be written as:

   3 \text{ treeks} = 1 \text{ goolee}
   \]

2. We also know that two treeks are equivalent to one squig. This can be written as:

3. To find out how many treeks are equivalent to one squig, we can use the information from the second equation. Since two treeks are equivalent to one squig, we can express one squig in terms of treeks as:
   \[

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product of the two polynomials and compare the coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term separately, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

For \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

For \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

For \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We start by solving the equation for the constant term:

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for the \(t\) term:

\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we verify the values of \(a\) and \(b\) by substituting them into the equation for the \(t^3\) term:

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3(2) + 20 = 26 \implies 6 + 20 = 26 \implies 26 = 26
\]

Finally, we verify the equation for the \(t^2\) term:

\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8 \implies -6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -8 \implies -6 + 10 - 12 = -8 \implies -8 = -8
\]

All the equations are satisfied, so the values \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to use the information given about the volume and the rate at which the tank is being filled with water.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per second and that the height of the tank is 4 meters. Therefore, the volume of water added per second is equal to the cross-sectional area of the tank multiplied by the rate at which the height of the water is increasing. The cross-sectional area of the tank is the area of the circular base, which is \( \pi r^2 \). Since the height of the tank is 4 meters, the volume of water added per second is:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to solve for \( r \):

"To determine the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has at least one horizontal tangent, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and its derivative.

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{as } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{as } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the derivative of \(f(x)\):
\[
f'(x) =
\begin{cases}
2ax & \text{as } x \geq a,\\
a & \text{as } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

A horizontal tangent occurs where the derivative \(f'(x) = 0\). We need to check both cases for \(f'(x)\).

1. For \(x \geq a\), \(f'(x) = 2ax\). Setting \(f'(x) = 0\), we get:
\[
2ax = 0 \implies x = 0 \quad \text{(if } a \neq 0\text{)}.
\]
However, \(x = 0\) is not in the domain \(x \geq a\) unless \(a \leq 0\). If \(a > 0\), there is no solution in this domain.

2. For \(x < a\), \(f'(x) = a\). Setting \(f'(x) = 0\), we get:
\[
a = 0.

This implies \(a = 0\), but we need to check if this value satisfies the condition of having at least one horizontal tangent.

If \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[

In this case, \(f'(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), meaning the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is a horizontal line, which has infinitely many horizontal tangents.

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the circle described by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \( (h, k) \) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is 6, divide it by 2 to get 3, and then square it to get 9. So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the center is \((5, -3)\) and the radius squared is \(34 - c\). We are given that the radius of the circle is 1, so the radius squared is \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) where \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
This equation has two solutions: \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\). This simplifies to \(0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda\), which is always true for \(\lambda \geq 1\). Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) where \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is not a fixed point of \(f\), but it is a fixed point of \(f(f(x))\). Let's denote \(y = f(x)\). Then we have \(f(y) = x\). This gives us the system of equations:
\[
y = \lambda x(1 - x),
\]
\[
x = \lambda y(1 - y).
\]
Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[
x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Since \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
1 = \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (\lambda + 1)x + \lambda^2 (\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For there to be a solution \(x \in (0,1)\), the discriminant of this cubic equation must be non-negative. However, a simpler approach is to test specific values of \(\lambda\).

Let's test \(\lambda = 2\):
\[

\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1).
\]
Expanding this, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = 2(4x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 4x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x) = 2(0) = 0.

This is not equal to \(x\), so \(\lambda = 2\) is not a solution.

Let's test \(\lambda = 3\):
\[
f(x) = 3x(1 - x) = 3x - 3x^2.
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). First, we find \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(3x - 3x^2) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(1 - (3x - 3x^2)) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(3x^2 - 3x + 1).
\]
Expanding this, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = 3(9x^3 - 9x^2 + 3x - 9x^3 + 9x^2 - 3x) = 3(0) = 0.

We need to find \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). First, we find \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(4x - 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - (4x - 4x^2)) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(1 - 4x + 4x^2) = 4(4x - 4x^2)(4x^2 - 4x + 1).

Expanding this, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = 4(16x^3 - 16x^2 + 4x - 16x^3 + 16x^2 - 4x) = 4(0) = 0.

This is not equal to \(x\), so \(\lambda = 4\) is not a solution.

Finally, let's test \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Notice that \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\) and \(\sin 50^\circ = \cos 40^\circ\). So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ.
\]

This can be rearranged as:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ).
\]

Using the angle addition formulas, we get:

\[
\cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin (40^\circ - 35^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Again, using the angle addition formulas, we get:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ\) and \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ\), so we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) and \(\sin (90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos (90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin (90^\circ - 5^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

This simplifies to \(\tan 25^\circ\), so \(\theta = 25^\circ\).

Thus, the value of \(\theta\) is \(\boxed{25^\circ}\).","[25, '25^\\circ']",120^\circ,"[120, '120']",False

Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we need to count the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \(42!\). Typically, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of times 10 is a factor in \(42!\) is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This suggests that the maximum might occur when \( x = y \). Let's substitute \( x = y \) into the function:

Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[ 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We also need to check the endpoints \( x = -1 \) and \( x = 1 \).

Now, we evaluate \( g(x) \) at these points:
\[ g\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ g\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1, \]
\[ g(1) = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 0 = 0, \]
\[ g(-1) = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 2 \cdot (-1) \cdot 0 = 0. \]

The maximum value of \( g(x) \) is 1, which occurs at \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), and then divide by 2. The area of the triangle is given by:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\|
\]

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The vectors are \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\). The cross product is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the magnitude of this vector:

\[
\left\| \overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} \right\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is then:

\[

"To solve for \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) given that \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we start by recognizing that \( z \) is a root of a quadratic equation. Let's denote \( \alpha = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), which is the golden ratio. The quadratic equation whose roots are \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) is \( t^2 - \alpha t + 1 = 0 \).

The roots of this quadratic equation are:
\[ z = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\alpha^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 4}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 4}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 16}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\frac{-10 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4}}}{2} = \frac{\alpha \pm \sqrt{\frac{-5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}}}{2}. \]

However, we can use the fact that \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) are roots of the equation \( t^2 - \alpha t + 1 = 0 \), and thus \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) satisfy the recurrence relation \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} = \alpha (z^{n-1} + \frac{1}{z^{n-1}}) - (z^{n-2} + \frac{1}{z^{n-2}}) \).

Let's define \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \). We know that \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \alpha \). Using the recurrence relation, we can find \( a_2 \):
\[ a_2 = \alpha a_1 - a_0 = \alpha^2 - 2 = \left(\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^2 - 2 = \frac{1 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5}{4} - 2 = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} - 8}{4} = \frac{-2 + 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Now, we can use the recurrence relation to find \( a_3 \):
\[ a_3 = \alpha a_2 - a_1 = \alpha \left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}\right) - \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{(1 + \sqrt{5})(-1 + \sqrt{5}) - 2(1 + \sqrt{5})}{4} = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{5} - \sqrt{5} + 5 - 2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{2 - 2\sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 - \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

We observe that \( a_3 = -a_1 \) and \( a_4 = -a_2 \). This pattern suggests that \( a_{2k} = (-1)^k a_2 \) and \( a_{2k+1} = (-1)^k a_1 \). Therefore, \( a_{85} = -a_1 = -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric properties and relationships in the triangle. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the centroid and the medians**: The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

2. **Properties of the line through the centroid parallel to a side**: A line through the centroid of a triangle that is parallel to one of its sides will intersect the other two sides at points that divide those sides in the ratio 2:1. This means that if we draw a line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\), it will intersect \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), and \(M\) and \(N\) will divide \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively in the ratio 2:1.

3. **Area relationship**: The line through the centroid parallel to a side of the triangle creates a smaller triangle that is similar to the original triangle. The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since the line through the centroid divides the sides in the ratio 2:1, the smaller triangle \(AGN\) (or \(AGM\)) is similar to the original triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of 1:3. Therefore, the area of the smaller triangle is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of the original triangle.

4. **Calculate the area of triangle \(AGN\)**: Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AGN\) is \(\frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16\).

5. **Identify the triangle \(WUH\)**: The triangle \(WUH\) is the same as triangle \(AGN\) because \(M\) and \(N\) are the points where the line through the centroid parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) and \(AC\), and \(U\) is the point where this line intersects \(BC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(WUH\) is also 16.

"To find the sixtieth term of the arithmetic sequence where the 20th term is 200 and the 40th term is 500, we need to determine the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\) of the sequence.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a + (n-1)d \]

Given:
\[ a_{20} = a + 19d = 200 \]
\[ a_{40} = a + 39d = 500 \]

We can set up a system of linear equations based on these given terms:
1. \( a + 19d = 200 \)
2. \( a + 39d = 500 \)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[ (a + 39d) - (a + 19d) = 500 - 200 \]
\[ 20d = 300 \]
\[ d = 15 \]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[ a + 19(15) = 200 \]
\[ a + 285 = 200 \]
\[ a = 200 - 285 \]
\[ a = -85 \]

Now that we have \(a = -85\) and \(d = 15\), we can find the sixtieth term \(a_{60}\) using the general formula:

"To determine the number of divisors of \( n^{24} \), we start by expressing \( n \) in its prime factorized form. Let \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \), where \( p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_k \) are distinct prime numbers and \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_k \) are their respective positive integer exponents. The number of divisors of a number is found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in its prime factorization and then multiplying the results. Therefore, the number of divisors of \( n \) is given by:

\[
(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
\]

For \( n^{24} \), the prime factorization is \( n^{24} = (p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k})^{24} = p_1^{24e_1} p_2^{24e_2} \cdots p_k^{24e_k} \). The number of divisors of \( n^{24} \) is then:

\[
(24e_1 + 1)(24e_2 + 1) \cdots (24e_k + 1)

We are given that the number of divisors of \( n^{24} \) is \( 2^{24} \). Therefore, we have:

\[
(24e_1 + 1)(24e_2 + 1) \cdots (24e_k + 1) = 2^{24}
\]

Since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, each factor \( 24e_i + 1 \) must also be a power of 2. The only power of 2 that is 1 more than a multiple of 24 is 17 (since \( 24 \cdot 1 + 1 = 25 \) is not a power of 2, and \( 24 \cdot 2 + 1 = 49 \) is not a power of 2, and so on). Therefore, each \( 24e_i + 1 \) must be 17, which means \( e_i = 1 \) for all \( i \). This implies that \( n \) is a product of distinct primes, each raised to the power of 1. The number of such primes is the number of factors in the product, which is the number of terms in the product. Since each term is 17, and there are 24 terms (because \( 17^{24} = 2^{24} \)), there must be 24 terms. Therefore, \( n \) is the product of 24 distinct primes.

The number of divisors of \( n \) is then:

(1+1)(1+1) \cdots (1+1) = 2^{24}

\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2.\]
So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{10^7 \cdot 2} = \frac{4321}{2 \cdot 10^7} = \frac{4321}{20000000}.\]

Next, we perform the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605.\]

The units digit of the decimal representation of the fraction is the units digit of the number 0.00021605, which is 0.

Therefore, the digit in the units place of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",14,"[14, '14']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we can use the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to simplify the expression. This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). So the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\cos 10^\circ)^2
\]

We can use the product-to-sum identities to simplify the product of sines and cosines. However, a more straightforward approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

So the original expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

"To determine which geometric shape the equation \( z = c \) represents in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), let's analyze the equation step by step.

1. **Understanding Cylindrical Coordinates**:
   - \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
   - \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
   - \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Analyzing the Equation \( z = c \)**:
   - The equation \( z = c \) states that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \).
   - This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \).

3. **Visualizing the Shape**:
   - Since \( z \) is fixed at \( c \), the points can vary in their radial distance \( r \) and angular coordinate \( \theta \) but will always be at the same height \( z = c \).
   - This describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The equation \( z = c \) represents a plane in three-dimensional space.

"To find the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the given information about the magnitudes of the vectors and their cross product.

The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta,
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\).

We know that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

Now, substituting the known values into the magnitude formula for the cross product, we get:
\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta.
\]
Simplifying this equation, we find:
\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta \implies \sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) or \(150^\circ\). Since we are asked for the smallest angle, we have:
\[
\theta = 30^\circ.

Thus, the smallest angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\).","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we first need to understand the relationship between the roots of \( g(x) \) and the roots of \( f(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]

The function \( g(x) \) is defined as:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to consider the roots of \( f(x) \). Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Therefore, we have:
\[ f(x) = (x - \alpha)(x - \beta)(x - \gamma) \]

The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is given by Vieta's formulas:
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the roots of \( g(x) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \]

This implies:
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]

Let \( y = x + 5 \). Then:
\[ f(y) = 0 \]

The roots of \( f(y) = 0 \) are \( \alpha, \beta, \gamma \). Therefore, the roots of \( f(x + 5) = 0 \) are:
\[ x + 5 = \alpha \implies x = \alpha - 5 \]
\[ x + 5 = \beta \implies x = \beta - 5 \]
\[ x + 5 = \gamma \implies x = \gamma - 5 \]

The roots of \( g(x) \) are \( \alpha - 5, \beta - 5, \gamma - 5 \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we add these roots:
\[ (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) \]

Using the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \):
\[ \alpha + \beta + \gamma = 49 \]

Thus:
\[ (\alpha - 5) + (\beta - 5) + (\gamma - 5) = (\alpha + \beta + \gamma) - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34 \]

"To find the value of \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This gives us:

\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

To proceed, we use the triple angle identity for tangent, which states that \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). Setting \(x = 10^\circ\), we get:

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.
\]

Solving for \(\tan 10^\circ\), we get a complicated polynomial equation, but we can use known values and properties of trigonometric functions to simplify our work. Instead, we use the known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12\). This result can be derived from more advanced trigonometric identities or verified through numerical methods.

Thus, we have:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 12 = 15.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Sye soucs are in \( n \) symvekse many shoed wees, given that the sum of the interior angles of \( n \) symvekse many shoed wees is \( 1070^\circ \).

First, let's recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is given by:
\[
180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]
We are given that this sum is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
180(n-2) = 1070
\]
To find \( n \), we first divide both sides of the equation by 180:
\[
n-2 = \frac{1070}{180}
\]
Simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
n-2 = \frac{1070 \div 10}{180 \div 10} = \frac{107}{18} \approx 5.9444
\]
Since \( n \) must be an integer, we round 5.9444 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:
\[
n-2 = 6

Adding 2 to both sides, we get:

So, the number of symvekse many shoed wees is \( n = 8 \).

Now, we need to determine how many Sye soucars are in 8 symvekse many shoed wees. Since each symvekse many shoed wee contains 8 Sye soucars, the total number of Sye soucars in 8 symvekse many shoed wees is:

"To find the unique unitary foot \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[
(t + 2) \cdot t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

First, let's expand and simplify the congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula for \( at^2 + bt + c \equiv 0 \pmod{p} \) is given by:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \pmod{p}
\]

In our case, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \pmod{23}

\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \pmod{23}
\]
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \pmod{23}
\]

We need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We will use the fact that \( 8 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \) and check for a number \( x \) such that \( x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \).

By trial, we find:
\[
3^2 = 9 \not\equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 = 16 \not\equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}

\[
6^2 = 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}

\[

\]
\[
9^2 = 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}

\[
10^2 = 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

Thus, \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \).

Now, we substitute back into the quadratic formula:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2} \pmod{23}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 + 10}{2} \equiv \frac{8}{2} \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
t \equiv \frac{-2 - 10}{2} \equiv \frac{-12}{2} \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}

We need to check which of these solutions satisfy the original condition \( 0 < t < 23 \). Both \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \) are within the range \( 0 < t < 23 \).

For \( t = 4 \):
\[
t + 2 = 6
\]
\[
6 \cdot 4 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

For \( t = 17 \):
\[
t + 2 = 19
\]
\[
19 \cdot 17 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

   Two lines are parallel if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so the lines are parallel.

2. **Find the distance between the two parallel lines:**
   The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines can be found using the formula:
   \[

1. **Right side**: The right side of the rectangle is the vertical line segment from \((5,4)\) to \((5,-4)\). The integer coordinates on this side are \((5,4)\), \((5,3)\), \((5,2)\), \((5,1)\), \((5,0)\), \((5,-1)\), \((5,-2)\), \((5,-3)\), and \((5,-4)\). This gives us 9 points.
2. **Top side**: The top side of the rectangle is the horizontal line segment from \((5,4)\) to \((-5,4)\). The integer coordinates on this side are \((5,4)\), \((4,4)\), \((3,4)\), \((2,4)\), \((1,4)\), \((0,4)\), \((-1,4)\), \((-2,4)\), \((-3,4)\), and \((-4,4)\). This gives us 10 points.

However, the vertices of the rectangle are counted twice (once for each side they belong to). Since there are 4 vertices, we have counted 4 points twice. Therefore, we need to subtract these 4 points from the total.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}.
\]

We are given the following cross products:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and vector additions/subtractions:

"To determine the average price of the seines in the 70's, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of seines sold in the 70's and their respective prices.
2. Calculate the total revenue from the seines sold in the 70's.
3. Divide the total revenue by the number of seines sold in the 70's to find the average price per seine.
4. Round the average price to the nearest whole number.

From the table, we can see that in the 70's, Juan sold the following seines:
- 12 seines at 12 sent each
- 12 seines at 12 sent each
- 6 seines at 8 sent each
- 9 seines at 13 sent each

First, we calculate the total revenue from the seines sold in the 70's:
\[
12 \times 12 + 12 \times 12 + 6 \times 8 + 9 \times 13
\]
\[

"To solve for the area of triangle \( \triangle ACD \) given the conditions of the trapezoid \(ABCD\) with \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \), \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), and \( \overline{AC} \) bisecting \( \angle BAD \), and the area of the trapezoid \( [ABCD] = 42 \), we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the given information and relationships:**
   - \( \overline{AD} \parallel \overline{BC} \)
   - \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \)
   - \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \)
   - \( [ABCD] = 42 \)

2. **Use the properties of the trapezoid and the perpendicularity:**
   Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), \( \triangle ACD \) is a right triangle with \( \angle ACD = 90^\circ \).

3. **Express the area of the trapezoid in terms of the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):**
   The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):
   \[
   [ABCD] = [ACD] + [ABC]
   \]
   Given \( [ABCD] = 42 \), we have:
   \[
   42 = [ACD] + [ABC]
   \]

4. **Use the angle bisector property:**
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) bisects \( \angle BAD \), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
   \[
   \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD}
   \]

5. **Express the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) in terms of their bases and heights:**
   Let \( AD = a \), \( BC = b \), and \( CD = h \). Since \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), the height of \( \triangle ACD \) is \( h \). Let the height of \( \triangle ABC \) be \( h_1 \).

   The area of \( \triangle ACD \) is:
   \[
   [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
   \]

   The area of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h_1
   \]

6. **Relate the heights \( h \) and \( h_1 \):**
   Since \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of both triangles and \( \overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD} \), we have:
   \[
   h_1 = h
   \]

7. **Substitute \( h_1 = h \) into the area expressions:**
   \[
   [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
   \]

8. **Combine the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \):**
   \[
   42 = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
   \]
   Factor out \( \frac{1}{2} \times h \):
   \[

   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   84 = h \times (a + b)
   \]

9. **Solve for \( h \):**
   Since \( h \) is the height of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \overline{AC} \) is the height of both triangles, we can use the fact that the total area of the trapezoid is 42:
   \[
   h = \frac{84}{a + b}
   \]

10. **Find the area of \( \triangle ACD \):**
    \[
    [ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b}
    \]

11. **Simplify the expression for \( [ACD] \):**
    \[
    [ACD] = \frac{42a}{a + b}
    \]

12. **Use the fact that \( [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \):**
    \[
    [ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42b}{a + b}

13. **Sum the areas to verify:**
    \[
    [ACD] + [ABC] = \frac{42a}{a + b} + \frac{42b}{a + b} = \frac{42(a + b)}{a + b} = 42

14. **Conclusion:**
    Since the total area of the trapezoid is 42, and the areas of \( \triangle ACD \) and \( \triangle ABC \) must sum to 42, we have:

    [ACD] = 21

   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:

   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9

   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:
   \[

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions.
2. Substitute these values into the operation definition.
3. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start with the given fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\).

Now, substitute these values into the operation definition:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, we need to simplify the expression \((7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)\). First, calculate the product of the integers:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

So the expression becomes:
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Now, simplify the fraction \(\frac{21}{30}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 30 is 3, so we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by 3:
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

Now substitute \(\frac{7}{10}\) back into the expression:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right)
\]

To multiply 70 by \(\frac{7}{10}\), we can rewrite 70 as \(\frac{70}{1}\) and then multiply the fractions:
\[
70 \left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = \frac{70 \cdot 7}{1 \cdot 10} = \frac{490}{10} = 49

   - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly on the circumference of a circle.
   - We need to find the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Insight:**
   - Two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged in such a way that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.
   - This means that if we list the points in the order they appear when moving around the circle, the sequence must be either \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations).

3. **Counting the Favorable Outcomes:**
   - There are \(4!\) (24) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence.
   - Out of these 24 arrangements, only 2 specific arrangements (the ones mentioned above) will result in intersecting chords.
   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 2.

   - The total area of the cakes is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   - The smaller circle has a radius of 1 unit, and the larger circle has a radius of 2 units.

2. **Calculate the areas of the circles:**
   - The area of the smaller circle is \(\pi \times 1^2 = \pi\).
   - The area of the larger circle is \(\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi\).

3. **Determine the area of the cakes:**
   - The total area of the cakes is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

4. **Understand the configuration of the cakes:**
   - The cakes are arranged such that the total area of the cakes is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. This means the cakes cover \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the larger circle's area.

5. **Determine the area of the smaller circle that is covered by the cakes:**
   - Since the total area of the cakes is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the larger circle's area, the area of the smaller circle that is covered by the cakes is \(\frac{5}{12} \times \pi = \frac{5\pi}{12}\).

6. **Determine the angle \( \angle ADC \):**
   - The smaller circle is divided into two parts by the line segment \(AD\). The area of the smaller circle that is covered by the cakes is \(\frac{5\pi}{12}\), which is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total area of the smaller circle.
   - Since the smaller circle is divided into two parts by the line segment \(AD\), and the area of the smaller circle that is covered by the cakes is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total area, the angle \( \angle ADC \) must be \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total angle of the smaller circle.
   - The total angle of the smaller circle is \(360^\circ\). Therefore, the angle \( \angle ADC \) is \(\frac{5}{12} \times 360^\circ = 150^\circ\).

\[ V_{\text{water}} = V_{\text{sphere}} - V_{\text{cone}} = 288 \pi - 320 \pi = -32 \pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}.

Next, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}.

- ""Vayets"" is the unit of speed given in the problem.
- ""duels"" is the unit of distance we need to convert from ""Vayets"".
- ""markand"" is the unit of time we need to convert from ""minutes"".

The problem does not provide a direct conversion factor between ""Vayets"" and ""duels"", nor does it provide a conversion factor between ""minutes"" and ""markand"". However, based on the context, we can infer that the problem is asking for a conversion that is implied by the units themselves. 

If we assume that ""Vayets"" and ""duels"" are equivalent units of speed (which is a common assumption in such problems if no other conversion factors are provided), then the speed of the ""Vet"" in ""duels per markand"" would be the same as its speed in ""Vayets per minute"".

"To solve the problem of finding the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Let's apply the formula step by step.

1. Calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26

2. Calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000

"Let's denote the three consecutive whole numbers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the product of these three numbers is 120:
\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

Next, we are given that the quotient when the product is divided by the sum of the three numbers is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{(n-1) + n + (n+1)} = 24
\]

Simplify the sum of the three numbers:
\[
(n-1) + n + (n+1) = 3n
\]

Substitute this into the quotient equation:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{3n} = 24
\]

Since \((n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120\), substitute 120 for the product:
\[
\frac{120}{3n} = 24

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\). Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations gives us:
\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:
\[

Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we know that:

This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly. Therefore, we have:

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), and point \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the side lengths of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Therefore, \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AB = AC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\).

Let's place the triangle in the coordinate plane with \(A\) at \((0, 11)\), \(B\) at \((-x, 0)\), and \(C\) at \((x, 0)\). The midpoint \(M\) of \(BC\) is at \((0, 0)\). Since \(D\) is on \(\overline{AM}\) and \(AD = 10\), the coordinates of \(D\) are \((0, 1)\).

Now, we need to find the length of \(AB\) (which is equal to \(AC\)). Using the distance formula, we have:
\[ AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}. \]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[ BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(3\theta). \]
Since \(BC = 2x\), \(BD = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\), and \(CD = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\), we have:
\[ (2x)^2 = (\sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 + (\sqrt{x^2 + 1})^2 - 2 \cdot \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \cdot \sqrt{x^2 + 1} \cdot \cos(3\theta). \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 4x^2 = 2(x^2 + 1) - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta). \]
\[ 4x^2 = 2x^2 + 2 - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta). \]
\[ 2x^2 = 2 - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta). \]
\[ x^2 = 1 - (x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta). \]
\[ x^2 + (x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta) = 1. \]
\[ \cos(3\theta) = \frac{1 - x^2}{x^2 + 1}. \]

We also know that \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\). Since \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 11^2}} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 121}}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[ \frac{1 - x^2}{x^2 + 1} = 4\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 121}}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + 121}}\right). \]
This is a complex equation, but we can solve it by trial and error or by using known values. By trying \(x = 11\), we get:
\[ \cos(\theta) = \frac{11}{\sqrt{11^2 + 11^2}} = \frac{11}{11\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}. \]
Then, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = 4\left(\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{8}\right) - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.\]
This matches our earlier equation, so \(x = 11\) is correct. Therefore, the side length of \(AB\) is:
\[ AB = \sqrt{11^2 + 11^2} = \sqrt{2 \cdot 11^2} = 11\sqrt{2}. \]

Thus, the side lengths of triangle \(ABC\) are \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False
"To determine the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the sum of the integers:**
   The sum of the 27 consecutive integers is given as \(3^7\). First, calculate \(3^7\):
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]

2. **Determine the median:**
   The median of a set of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th number in the sequence (since the median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number). Let's denote the first integer in the sequence by \(a\). The 27 consecutive integers can be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

3. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   The sum of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
   \]
   Here, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the median, which is \(a + 13\). Therefore, the sum is:
   \[
   27 \times (a + 13) = 2187

   Solving for \(a + 13\):
   \[
   a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

   So, \(a = 81 - 13 = 68\).

4. **Identify the median:**
   The median is the 14th term in the sequence, which is \(a + 13\). Since we have already calculated that \(a + 13 = 81\), the median is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to analyze the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) and determine the values of \(x\) that satisfy the inequality.

First, let's rewrite the inequality in two parts:
1. \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)
2. \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, we only need to focus on the second part of the inequality:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\]

To solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we can make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y < 21\]
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\]

Next, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the roots. Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}\]
So, the roots are:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we only consider the positive root \(y = 3\). The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be written as:
\[(y - 3)(y + 7) < 0\]

The roots of the equation \((y - 3)(y + 7) = 0\) are \(y = 3\) and \(y = -7\). Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the interval where \(0 \leq y < 3\). Therefore, we have:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Given \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\), we substitute these values into the identity:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the identity, we get:
\[
-8 = s((s^2 - 2p) - p),
\]
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also have the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express \(x+y\), \(x+z\), and \(y+z\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
x+y = s-z, \quad x+z = s-y, \quad y+z = s-x.
\]
Substituting these into the equation, we get:
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12,
\]
\[
s(xy + xz + yz) - (xyz + xyz + xyz) = 12,
\]
\[
s \cdot p - 3 \cdot 4 = 12,

\[

\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.

s = 4.

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):

For the \(9^{\text{de}}\) grade:

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the radius of the semicircle that forms the boundary of the track and then use that to find the area of the rectangular field.

First, let's analyze the given information. The perimeter of the track is 400 meters. The track consists of two straight sides and two semicircles. The straight sides are the same length as the diameter of the semicircles, and the semicircles together form a full circle.

Let's denote the radius of the semicircle by \( r \). The diameter of the semicircle is \( 2r \), which is also the length of each straight side of the rectangle. The perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the full circle formed by the two semicircles. Therefore, the perimeter can be expressed as:
\[
2 \times 2r + 2\pi r = 400
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
4r + 2\pi r = 400
\]
Factoring out \( r \) from the left side, we have:
\[
r(4 + 2\pi) = 400
\]
Solving for \( r \), we get:
\[
r = \frac{400}{4 + 2\pi} = \frac{400}{4(1 + \frac{\pi}{2})} = \frac{100}{1 + \frac{\pi}{2}} = \frac{100}{1 + 1.5708} \approx \frac{100}{2.5708} \approx 38.85

   - Let \(ST = a\), \(RT = b\), and \(RS = c\).

2. **Use the given information:**

   - In a right triangle, \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).
   - Here, the opposite side to \(\angle R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RS\).
   - Therefore, \(\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RS} = \frac{2}{5}\).

3. **Set up the relationship:**
   - Let \(ST = 2k\) and \(RS = 5k\) for some positive constant \(k\).

4. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the remaining side:**
   - In \(\triangle RST\), \(RS\) is the hypotenuse.
   - By the Pythagorean theorem: \(RS^2 = ST^2 + RT^2\).
   - Substitute the known values: \((5k)^2 = (2k)^2 + RT^2\).
   - Simplify: \(25k^2 = 4k^2 + RT^2\).
   - Solve for \(RT^2\): \(RT^2 = 25k^2 - 4k^2 = 21k^2\).
   - Therefore, \(RT = \sqrt{21k^2} = k\sqrt{21}\).

5. **Find \(\sin{T}\):**
   - In a right triangle, \(\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\).

"To find the maximum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to maximize the distance function \( D(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Since \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we can substitute this into the distance function to get:

\[ D(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2} \]

First, simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[ D(x) = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} \]

To find the maximum value of \( D(x) \), we can instead maximize the function inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[ f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x = 2x(x^2 - 2) \]

Setting the derivative equal to zero gives us:

\[ 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0 \]

So, the critical points are \( x = 0 \), \( x = \sqrt{2} \), and \( x = -\sqrt{2} \). We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these points:

\[ f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2} \]
\[ f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]
\[ f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2} \]

The maximum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{9}{2} \), so the maximum value of \( D(x) \) is:

\[ D(x) = \sqrt{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Thus, the maximum distance from the origin to a point on the graph is \( \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \), and we have \( a = 9 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 9 + 2 = 11 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0
   \]
   Factoring out \( x \):
   \[
   x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation:
   \[
   -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0
   \]
   The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions in this range. Therefore, there are no solutions for \( f(x) = 0 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

2. For \( x > 3 \):
   \[
   f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Let's test \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   -4^3 + 2 \cdot 4^2 + 3 \cdot 4 = -64 + 32 + 12 = -20 \neq 6
   \]
   Let's test \( x = 5 \):
   \[
   -5^3 + 2 \cdot 5^2 + 3 \cdot 5 = -125 + 50 + 15 = -60 \neq 6
   \]
   Since the function is continuous and changes from negative to positive as \( x \) increases from 3 to 5, there must be a root between 3 and 5. However, without further numerical methods, we can't determine the exact value. But for the purpose of this problem, we can assume that the root is not easily solvable by hand and is not necessary for the final answer.

So, we have \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"To find the distance from point \( P \) to the orthocenter of the tetrahedron, we need to understand the geometric properties of the tetrahedron and the given distances from \( P \) to the vertices.

Given:
- The distances from \( P \) to the vertices of the tetrahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11.

First, let's denote the vertices of the tetrahedron as \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \), and the orthocenter as \( H \). The orthocenter \( H \) is the point where the altitudes of the tetrahedron intersect.

We know that the orthocenter \( H \) is equidistant from all four vertices of the tetrahedron. However, since \( P \) is not necessarily the orthocenter, we need to use the given distances to find the distance from \( P \) to \( H \).

To proceed, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a tetrahedron is constant if the point is the orthocenter. This is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions.

Let \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, \) and \( d_5 \) be the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, \) and \( E \) respectively. We are given:
\[ d_1 = 3, \quad d_2 = 7, \quad d_3 = 8, \quad d_4 = 9, \quad d_5 = 11 \]

The sum of the squares of these distances is:
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 = 3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 \]

Calculating each term:
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ 7^2 = 49 \]
\[ 8^2 = 64 \]
\[ 9^2 = 81 \]
\[ 11^2 = 121 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324 \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a tetrahedron is constant if the point is the orthocenter, we have:
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 = 324 \]

Given that \( P \) is not the orthocenter, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter \( H \). Let \( h \) be the distance from \( P \) to \( H \). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given, and we need to find \( h \).

We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \( H \) to the vertices plus five times the square of the distance from \( P \) to \( H \):
\[ d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 = 4h^2 + (d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 - 4h^2) \]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is 324, we have:
\[ 324 = 4h^2 + (324 - 4h^2) \]

Simplifying, we get:
\[ 324 = 4h^2 + 324 - 4h^2 \]
\[ 324 = 324 \]

This equation is always true, confirming our setup. Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter \( H \) is:
\[ h = \sqrt{\frac{324}{5}} = \sqrt{64.8} \approx 8.05 \]

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the orthocenter is:
\[

"To determine how many Syferies (sy数字s) are in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8, and then count the number of digits in each representation.

### Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7

We repeatedly divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

### Step 2: Count the digits in the base 7 representation

The base 7 representation \(1556_7\) has 4 digits.

### Step 3: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8

We repeatedly divide the number by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

### Step 4: Count the digits in the base 8 representation

The base 8 representation \(1165_8\) has 4 digits.

### Final Answer

The number of Syferies in the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is 4, and the number of Syferies in the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is also 4. Therefore, the total number of Syferies is:

"To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the given conditions and deduce the number of handstandings that can occur among the eight people.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - There are 8 people.
   - Each person can only hold hands with another person if they are not already holding hands with someone else.
   - We need to find the maximum number of handstandings that can occur under these conditions.

2. **Graph Theory Interpretation:**
   - This problem can be interpreted as finding the maximum number of edges in a simple graph with 8 vertices (people) where no two edges (handstandings) share a common vertex (person) more than once.

3. **Complete Graph and Maximum matchings:**
   - A complete graph with 8 vertices (denoted as \( K_8 \)) would have each vertex connected to every other vertex, resulting in \(\frac{8 \times 7}{2} = 28\) edges.
   - However, since each person can only hold hands with one other person, we are looking for a maximum matching in the graph.

4. **Maximum Matching in a Graph:**
   - In a graph with an even number of vertices, the maximum matching will pair up all vertices such that each vertex is connected to exactly one other vertex.
   - For 8 vertices, the maximum number of edges in a matching is \(\frac{8}{2} = 4\).

"To find the polynomial \( g(x) \) such that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we need to substitute \( x-1 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \). The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \), we get:

\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

We do not need to expand this expression fully to find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \). The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is simply \( p(1) \). Therefore, we can find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) by evaluating \( g(1) \):

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form of the line is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

Simplify the numerator and the denominator:

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
From Vieta's formulas, we have \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), so \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -2 - (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)\). Let \(S = \alpha_3 + \alpha_4\), then \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -2 - S\). Therefore,
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (-2 - S)S = -2S - S^2.
\]
We also know that:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 S + \alpha_3\alpha_4 (-2 - S) = 0.

This simplifies to:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 S - \alpha_3\alpha_4 (2 + S) = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2 S = \alpha_3\alpha_4 (2 + S).
\]
From Vieta's formulas, we have \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), so \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4}\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\frac{2S}{\alpha_3\alpha_4} = \alpha_3\alpha_4 (2 + S) \implies 2S = \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 (2 + S) \implies 2S = \left(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\right)^2 (2 + S) \implies 2S = \frac{4}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2} (2 + S).
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we have \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4}\) and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\). Therefore, we can solve for \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3\):
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2S - S^2 = -2(-2) - (-2)^2 = 4 - 4 = 0.
\]
Now, we need to find the individual values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). We know that:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 0^2 = 0.
\]
Since \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\), one of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), or \(S_3\) must be zero. Without loss of generality, let \(S_1 = 0\). Then \(S_2 + S_3 = 0\), so \(S_2 = -S_3\). We can solve for \(S_2\) and \(S_3\) using the quadratic equation:
\[
t^2 - (S_2 + S_3)t + S_2 S_3 = t^2 - 0t + 0 = t^2 = 0 \implies t = 0.

Therefore, \(S_2 = 0\) and \(S_3 = 0\). The values of the expressions are:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) by performing the long division.

Let's do the long division step by step:

- 500 goes into 1370 (we add a decimal point and a zero to 137, making it 1370) 2 times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). So, we write 2 after the decimal point.
- Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get 370.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 3700.
- 500 goes into 3700 7 times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). So, we write 7 after the 2.
- Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get 200.
- Bring down another 0 to make it 2000.
- 500 goes into 2000 4 times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). So, we write 4 after the 7.
- Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A, B, C,\) or \(D\).

First, let's consider the geometry of the problem. The center \(O\) of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is the intersection of its diagonals. The diagonals of a rectangle are equal in length and bisect each other, so \(O\) is equidistant from all four vertices \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\).

The region of points inside the rectangle that are closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of the four regions defined by the perpendicular bisectors of the segments connecting \(O\) to each vertex. These bisectors form a smaller square centered at \(O\) with side length equal to half the distance from \(O\) to any vertex.

The distance from \(O\) to any vertex is half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. If we let the length of the rectangle be \(2a\) and the width be \(2b\), then the length of the diagonal is \(2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\), and the distance from \(O\) to any vertex is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\). Therefore, the side length of the smaller square is \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\).

The area of the smaller square is \((\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = a^2 + b^2\). The area of the rectangle is \(4ab\). The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4ab}
\]

Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a/b = k\), so \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the probability formula, we get:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{4(kb)b} = \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{4kb^2} = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{4kb^2} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is \(\boxed{\frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}}\).","[(k**2 + 1)/((4*k)), '\\frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \begin{cases} 
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{cases} \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.0472 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The final answer is:

"To determine how much Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie altogether contributed in dollars and cents, we need to add their individual contributions together. Let's do this step by step.

First, let's list the contributions:
- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

We will add these amounts in pairs to make the calculation easier.

1. Add Linda's and Sherry's contributions:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70 \]

2. Add June's and Connie's contributions:
\[ 37.37 + 26.52 = 63.89 \]

3. Now, add the two sums together:
\[ 62.70 + 63.89 = 126.59 \]

So, the total amount contributed is \$126.59. This means Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie altogether contributed \$126.59.

Next, we need to determine how much money was left over after they took their contributions from the bank. Since the problem does not specify the total amount of money they had initially, we can only conclude that the total amount they contributed is \$126.59. The problem also asks how much they had left over, but since we don't have the initial amount, we can't determine the exact leftover amount. However, the problem seems to be asking for the total amount contributed, which we have already calculated.

"To determine the class average score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score for each group of students.
2. Sum the total scores from all groups.
3. Divide the total score by the number of students to find the average.

Let's start with the first step. We know the number of students and their scores in each group:

- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

First, we calculate the total score for each group:

- For the 20 students who scored 80: \(20 \times 80 = 1600\)
- For the 8 students who scored 90: \(8 \times 90 = 720\)
- For the 2 students who scored 100: \(2 \times 100 = 200\)

Next, we sum these total scores:

\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Now, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score. There are 30 students in total:

\[\frac{2520}{30} = 84\]

"To solve for the value of \( n \) in the given problem, we need to analyze the structure of the \( n \times n \) grid and the conditions provided. The problem states that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals in terms of \( n \):

1. The sum of the first row is \( (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) + (n+2) = 4n + 3 \).
2. The sum of the second row is \( (n+1) + (2n-9) + 1 + n = 4n - 7 \).
3. The sum of the third row is \( 2n-9 + n + (n-1) + (n-3) = 5n - 12 \).
4. The sum of the fourth row is \( n + (n-1) + (n-3) + (n-1) = 4n - 5 \).

Since the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same, we can set up the following equations:

\[ 4n + 3 = 4n - 7 = 5n - 12 = 4n - 5 = S \]

From the first two equations, we get:
\[ 4n + 3 = 4n - 7 \]
This is a contradiction, so we need to check the consistency of the sums. Instead, let's use the fact that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. We can use the sum of the first row to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4n + 3 \]

Now, let's check the sum of the first column:
\[ (n-3) + (n+1) + (n-1) + n = 4n - 3 \]
Since this must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[ 4n - 3 = 4n + 3 \]
This is also a contradiction, so we need to use the fact that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. Instead, let's use the fact that the sum of the numbers in each row, column, and diagonal is the same. We can use the sum of the first row to find \( S \):
\[ S = 4n + 3 \]

Now, let's check the sum of the main diagonal:
\[ (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) + (n-3) = 5n - 16 \]
Since this must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[ 5n - 16 = 4n + 3 \]
Solving for \( n \), we get:
\[ n = 19 \]

Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{19}\).","[19, '19']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine how much distance Martha has to walk compared to Jim, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field and then compare it to the distance Jim walks along the length of the field.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet, we can substitute these values into the formula:
\[ P = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha has to walk 1400 feet to walk around the entire field.

Next, we need to determine how much distance Jim walks. Since Jim walks along the length of the field, he walks the length of the field twice (once for each pass):
\[ \text{Distance Jim walks} = 2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we find the difference between the distance Martha walks and the distance Jim walks:
\[ \text{Difference} = 1400 - 800 = 600 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Martha walks \(\boxed{600}\) feet more than Jim.","[600, '600']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"To solve the problem, we start by noting that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, which means \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other property of the cube roots of unity is that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). From this, we can deduce that \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we simplify each term separately. Using the fact that \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\), we can rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}
\]

Next, we find a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}
\]

We know that \(\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega + \omega^2 = \omega + (-1 - \omega) = -1\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-1}{-1} = 1
\]

Thus, the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the die largest possible value of the area of the triangle formed by the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), we need to use the given distances and the formula for the area of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

First, let's place the points in a coordinate system. We can place point \(D\) at the origin \((0,0)\), point \(A\) at \((5,0)\), point \(B\) at \((3,4)\), and point \(C\) at \((0,6)\). This placement satisfies the given distances \(DA = 5\), \(DB = 3\), \(DC = 6\), \(AB = 5\), \(AC = 6\), and \(BC = 4\).

Now, we can calculate the area of triangle \(ABC\) using the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\):

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 5(4 - 6) + 3(6 - 0) + 0(0 - 4) \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 5(-2) + 3(6) + 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -10 + 18 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 8 \right| = 4

Thus, the die largest possible value of the area of the triangle formed by the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) is \(\boxed{12}\).

To verify, we can also use the formula for the area of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

where \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle:
