"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\) where \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the sides of the triangle relative to the angle \(D\):
   - \(EF\) is the opposite side to angle \(D\).
   - \(DF\) is the hypotenuse of the right triangle \(DEF\).

2. Recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
   \[
   \sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{EF}{DF}
   \]
   Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\), we can substitute these values into the sine equation:
   \[
   0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
   \]

3. Solve for \(DF\):
   \[
   DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
   \]

4. Now, we need to find the length of \(DE\), which is the adjacent side to angle \(D\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose:
   \[
   DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
   \]
   Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
   \[
   10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
   \]
   \[
   100 = DE^2 + 49
   \]
   \[
   DE^2 = 100 - 49
   \]
   \[
   DE^2 = 51
   \]
   \[
   DE = \sqrt{51}

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) that is the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i \) by an angle of \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3 \sqrt{2} - 3)i = \sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) radians counterclockwise:**
   To rotate a complex number \( z' = a + bi \) by an angle \(\theta\), we multiply \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}\), we have \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3 \sqrt{2} i \cdot i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can do this by dividing 242 by the smallest prime numbers until we can no longer divide.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[242 \div 2 = 121.\]
So, we can write:
\[242 = 2 \times 121.\]

Next, we factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by 2, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 3, but it is not. We then check if it is divisible by 5, but it is not. Finally, we check if it is divisible by 11:
\[121 \div 11 = 11.\]
So, we can write:
\[121 = 11 \times 11.\]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11.\]

Now, we can rewrite the square root of 242 using its prime factorization:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}.\]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can simplify this to:
\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{11^2 \times 2} = \sqrt{11^2} \times \sqrt{2} = 11 \sqrt{2}.\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To find the coefficient of the \(x^4\) term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this case, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x^4\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to determine the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in the term is 4. The exponent of \(x\) in the term \((10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\) is:

\[
3(5-k) + (-2k) = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k

We set this equal to 4 to find \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 4
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 - 4 = 5k \implies 11 = 5k \implies k = \frac{11}{5}

   \[
   m = \frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we need to find \(\tan A\).

First, recall the definitions of the trigonometric functions in a right triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}, \quad \tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}
\]
Given \(\sin A = 2 \cos A\), we can substitute the trigonometric definitions:
\[
\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}
\]
Let's denote the length of the side opposite to \(\angle A\) as \(2x\) and the length of the side adjacent to \(\angle A\) as \(x\). The hypotenuse can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
\text{hypotenuse} = \sqrt{(2x)^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{5x^2} = x\sqrt{5}
\]
Now, we can find \(\tan A\):

"1. **Determine the vertical asymptotes:**
   The function given is \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \). To find the vertical asymptotes, we need to determine where the denominator is zero because the function is undefined at these points.

   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0
   \]

   We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = -14 \).

   \[
   x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-14)}}{2 \cdot 1}
   \]

   Simplify inside the square root:

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 + 56}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{81}}{2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{5 \pm 9}{2}
   \]

   This gives us two solutions:

   \[
   x = \frac{5 + 9}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{5 - 9}{2} = -2
   \]

   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \).

2. **Determine the horizontal asymptote:**
   To find the horizontal asymptote, we analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \to \infty \) or \( x \to -\infty \). For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote depends on the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

   Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \).

3. **Sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):**
   From the vertical asymptotes, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \). From the horizontal asymptote, we have \( c = 0 \).

   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the maximum value of \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| / \|\bold{v}\|\) over all non-zero vectors \(\bold{v}\).

The operator norm of \( A \) is equal to the largest singular value of \( A \), which is the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \). First, we compute \( A^T A \):

\[

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The largest eigenvalue is \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\). Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the largest eigenvalue:

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:
\[5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expressed in base 10 as:

\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:

\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.

Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we need to expand the product of the two polynomials and then compare the coefficients with the given polynomial.

First, let's expand the product \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\):

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Expanding each term, we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a

Now, let's combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing coefficients:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and doesn't give us new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From equation 5:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 3:
\[
-6 + 5b + 4(-3) = -8
\]
\[
-6 + 5b - 12 = -8
\]
\[
5b - 18 = -8

\[
5b = 10

\[
b = 2

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) is horizontal to the line \(y = 2a\), we need to ensure that the function \(f(x)\) is constant and equal to \(2a\) for all \(x\). This means that the function must be the same for both cases \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

First, let's consider the case when \(x \geq a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax^2. \]
For the function to be constant and equal to \(2a\), we must have:
\[ ax^2 = 2a. \]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[ x^2 = 2. \]
This equation must hold for all \(x \geq a\), which is not possible unless \(a\) is such that the function is constant. However, \(x^2 = 2\) has solutions \(x = \sqrt{2}\) and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\), and these solutions are not valid for all \(x \geq a\).

Next, let's consider the case when \(x < a\). The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]
For the function to be constant and equal to \(2a\), we must have:
\[ ax + 2a = 2a. \]
Subtracting \(2a\) from both sides, we get:
\[ ax = 0. \]
Since \(a \neq 0\), we must have:
\[ x = 0. \]
This equation must hold for all \(x < a\), which is not possible unless \(a\) is such that the function is constant. However, \(x = 0\) is a specific value and not valid for all \(x < a\).

To satisfy both conditions simultaneously, we need to find a value of \(a\) such that the function is constant and equal to \(2a\) for all \(x\). This can only happen if the function is the same for both cases, which means the function must be a horizontal line. The only way this can happen is if the function is a constant function, which means the coefficient of \(x\) in both cases must be zero.

Therefore, we need:
\[ a = 0. \]
However, since \(a\) is a nonzero constant, we need to find a value of \(a\) such that the function is constant and equal to \(2a\) for all \(x\). The only way this can happen is if the function is a horizontal line, which means the coefficient of \(x\) in both cases must be zero.

The correct value of \(a\) is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the given equation represents a circle with a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\), where \((h, k)\) is the center and \(r\) is the radius.

The given equation is:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

First, we complete the square for the \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

For the \(x\) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 \]

For the \(y\) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y + 3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[ (x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with a radius of 1, the right side must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \(c\):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(f(x)) = x\). A fixed point of \(f(f(x)) = x\) is a point \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). Let's denote \(y = f(x)\). Then we have \(f(y) = x\). Therefore, we need to solve the system of equations:
\[y = \lambda x(1 - x)\]
\[x = \lambda y(1 - y).\]

Substituting \(y = \lambda x(1 - x)\) into the second equation, we get:
\[x = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)).\]
This simplifies to:
\[x = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).\]

We can factor out \(x\) from both sides of the equation:
\[x(1 - \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)) = 0.\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\)
2. \(1 - \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\).

For the first case, \(x = 0\) is a solution, but it is a fixed point of \(f(x)\), so we need to check the second case. Let's solve the equation:
\[1 - \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0.\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution in \((0,1)\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(g(x) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2)\).

The function \(g(x)\) is a cubic polynomial, and it has three roots. One of the roots is \(x = 0\) and the other two roots are in \((0,1)\) if the discriminant of the cubic equation is positive. The discriminant of a cubic equation \(ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0\) is given by a complicated formula, but we can use the fact that the discriminant is positive if the cubic equation has three real roots.

By analyzing the behavior of the function \(g(x)\), we can see that the discriminant is positive for \(\lambda \in (0,4)\). Therefore, the equation \(1 - \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 0\) has a solution in \((0,1)\) for \(\lambda \in (0,4)\).

Thus, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B = \cos (A + B)
\]
\[
\sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B = \sin (A + B)
\]

Applying these identities, we can rewrite the numerator and the denominator as follows:

Numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos (5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin (5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin (35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Since \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we have:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to rewrite \(\sin 5^\circ\) as \(\cos 85^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos (90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we can rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\) as \(\sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ\) as \(\cos 5^\circ\). Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

By inspection, we see that the numerator and the denominator are in the form of \(\cos (45^\circ - x)\) and \(\sin (45^\circ - x)\) respectively, which simplifies to \(\tan 40^\circ\). Therefore, we have:
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \ge y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then
\[ f(1, 1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = 1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then
\[ f(1, -1) = 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = 1 \), then
\[ f(-1, 1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]
If \( x = -1 \) and \( y = -1 \), then
\[ f(-1, -1) = -1 \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = 0. \]

Now, we consider the case where \( x = y \). Then,
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get
\[ 2(1 - 2x^2) = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Evaluating \( f \) at these points, we get
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]
Similarly,
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 1. \]

To confirm that 1 is indeed the maximum value, we consider the inequality
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le (x^2 + y^2)(1 - y^2 + 1 - x^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(2 - x^2 - y^2). \]
Let \( z = x^2 + y^2 \). Then,
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le z(2 - z). \]
The function \( z(2 - z) \) is maximized when \( z = 1 \), and the maximum value is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
" order to find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we need to calculate the magnitude of the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), and then divide by 2.

First, let's find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:
\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\
v_1 & v_2 & v_3
\end{vmatrix}
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant along the first row:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:
\[
\mathbf{i} \left(2 + 6\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 + 9\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(-2 + 6\right)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16}
\]
\[
= \sqrt{180}
\]
\[
= 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5}
\]
\[
= 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a complex number on the unit circle, meaning \( |z| = 1 \). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as \( e^{i\theta} \) for some angle \( \theta \). The given equation can be rewritten using the exponential form:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

So, we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

This implies:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). Since \( z = e^{i\theta} \), we have \( z^{85} = e^{i85\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{-i85\theta} \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = e^{i85\theta} + e^{-i85\theta} = 2\cos(85\theta). \]

To find \( \cos(85\theta) \), we need to determine the angle \( \theta \). The value \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is a specific cosine value that corresponds to a particular angle. However, we can use the periodicity of the cosine function to simplify our work. The cosine function is periodic with period \( 2\pi \), so we only need to consider the angle modulo \( 2\pi \).

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies \( \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \) is not a standard angle, but we can use the fact that \( \cos(85\theta) \) will be the same as \( \cos(\theta) \) because \( 85\theta \) modulo \( 2\pi \) will be equivalent to \( \theta \) due to the periodicity of the cosine function.

Thus, we have:

\[ \cos(85\theta) = \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = 2\cos(85\theta) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the geometric relationships and properties of the triangle and the points given. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the Points and Relationships:**
   - \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \).
   - \( M \) is the midpoint of \( AB \).
   - \( N \) is the midpoint of \( AC \).
   - \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \) are the feet of the perpendiculars from \( G \) to \( BC \), \( CA \), and \( AB \) respectively.
   - The area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144.
   - The area of triangle \( WGH \) is 144, where \( W \) is the midpoint of \( BC \).

2. **Properties of the Centroid and Midpoints:**
   - The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1.
   - The area of triangle \( WGH \) is one-fourth of the area of triangle \( ABC \) because \( W \) is the midpoint of \( BC \) and \( GH \) is parallel to \( BC \) and half its length.

3. **Calculate the Area of Triangle \( WGH \):**
   - Since \( W \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), triangle \( WGH \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \) with a similarity ratio of 1:2.
   - The area ratio of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area of triangle \( WGH \) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\) of the area of triangle \( ABC \).
   - Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( WGH \) is \(\frac{1}{4} \times 144 = 36\).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The area of triangle \( WGH \) is 36, not 144 as stated in the problem. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement or a need to re-evaluate the given information. However, based on the standard geometric properties and the given information, the correct area of triangle \( WGH \) is 36.

The number of moves required to solve a 3x3x3 cube is known to be 20 moves in the half turns metric (where a half turn is 180 degrees). However, the problem is asking about the number of moves in the quarter turns metric (where a quarter turn is 90 degrees).

The number of moves required to solve a 3x3x3 cube in the quarter turns metric is known to be 26 moves. This is a result of extensive computational analysis and group theory work.

Given that the problem states the number of moves is \(2^{24}\), we need to check if this is a known result or if it is a hypothetical scenario. The number \(2^{24}\) is a very large number, and it is not a typical number of moves for solving a cube. The standard number of moves for solving a 3x3x3 cube in the quarter turns metric is 26, not \(2^{24}\).

Therefore, the answer to the problem is that the number of moves required to solve the cube is not \(2^{24}\). The correct number of moves is 26.

"1. **Determine the total number of coins in the jar:**
   - The total number of coins in the jar is given as 75.

2. **Identify the types of coins:**
   - The coins in the jar are quarters, dimes, and nickels.

3. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - Let \( q \) be the number of quarters.
   - Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
   - Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

4. **Formulate the equations:**
   - The total number of coins is 75:
     \[
     q + d + n = 75
     \]
   - The total value of the coins is 7500 kopecks (since 1 ruble = 100 kopecks):
     \[
     25q + 10d + 5n = 7500
     \]

5. **Simplify the value equation:**
   - Divide the entire equation by 5 to make it easier to work with:
     \[
     5q + 2d + n = 1500
     \]

6. **Subtract the total number of coins equation from the simplified value equation:**
   \[
   (5q + 2d + n) - (q + d + n) = 1500 - 75
   \]
   Simplify the left-hand side:
   \[
   4q + d = 1425
   \]

7. **Solve for \( d \) in terms of \( q \):**
   \[
   d = 1425 - 4q
   \]

8. **Substitute \( d \) back into the total number of coins equation:**
   \[
   q + (1425 - 4q) + n = 75
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   q + 1425 - 4q + n = 75
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   -3q + 1425 + n = 75
   \]
   Solve for \( n \):
   \[
   n = 3q - 1350
   \]

9. **Determine the number of quarters:**
   - Since \( n \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 3q - 1350 \geq 0 \):
     \[
     3q \geq 1350
     \]
     \[
     q \geq 450
     \]
   - Also, since \( d \) must be a non-negative integer, \( 1425 - 4q \geq 0 \):
     \[
     1425 \geq 4q
     \]
     \[
     q \leq 356.25
     \]
   - Since \( q \) must be an integer, the only possible value is \( q = 350 \).

10. **Calculate the number of dimes and nickels:**
    - Substitute \( q = 350 \) into the equation for \( d \):
      \[
      d = 1425 - 4 \times 350
      \]
      \[
      d = 1425 - 1400
      \]
      \[
      d = 25
      \]
    - Substitute \( q = 350 \) into the equation for \( n \):
      \[
      n = 3 \times 350 - 1350
      \]
      \[
      n = 1050 - 1350
      \]
      \[
      n = 100
      \]

11. **Verify the solution:**
    - Total number of coins: \( 350 + 25 + 100 = 475 \) (This is incorrect, recheck calculations)
    - Correct calculation:
      \[
      q = 150, d = 150, n = 50

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 books out of 6 books. This is a combination problem, where the order of selection does not matter. The formula for combinations is given by:

\[
\binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( r \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial, which is the product of all positive integers up to that number.

In this problem, \( n = 6 \) and \( r = 2 \). Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2! \cdot 4!}
\]

Next, we simplify the factorials. Recall that \( 6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \), but we can cancel out the \( 4! \) in the numerator and the denominator since \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \). This leaves us with:

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4!}{2! \times 4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = \frac{30}{2} = 15

"To determine the area of the quadrilateral formed by the given points, we can use the Shoelace Theorem (also known as Gauss's area formula for polygons). The Shoelace Theorem states that for a polygon with vertices \((x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), \ldots, (x_n, y_n)\), the area \(A\) is given by:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (x_i y_{i+1} - y_i x_{i+1}) + (x_n y_1 - y_n x_1) \right|
\]

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the quadrilateral. From the diagram, we can see that the vertices are:
- \((0, 4)\)
- \((0, 0)\)
- \((2, 0)\)
- \((3, 4)\)

We will list these coordinates in order and apply the Shoelace Theorem:

x & y \\
\hline
0 & 4 \\
0 & 0 \\
2 & 0 \\
3 & 4 \\
0 & 4 \\

Now, we calculate the sum of the products of the coordinates as per the Shoelace Theorem:

\[
\text{Sum of } x_i y_{i+1} = (0 \cdot 0) + (0 \cdot 0) + (2 \cdot 4) + (3 \cdot 4) = 0 + 0 + 8 + 12 = 20

Next, we find the absolute difference between these sums and divide by 2:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 20 - 0 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the speed of the car and the number of steps it takes to travel a certain distance. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the speed of the car:**
   - The car can travel 4 steps when it is moving at its speed.
   - The car can travel 5 steps when it is moving at its speed plus one additional step.

   Let's denote the speed of the car as \( v \) steps per unit time. When the car is moving at its speed, it travels 4 steps in a certain time period. When it is moving at its speed plus one additional step, it travels 5 steps in the same time period.

   Therefore, the speed of the car plus one additional step is \( v + 1 \) steps per unit time. Since the time period is the same, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   4v = 5(v + 1)

   The correct interpretation is that the car travels 4 steps when it is moving at its speed, and it travels 5 steps when it is moving at its speed plus one additional step. This means the car's speed plus one additional step is 5 steps per unit time, and the car's speed is 4 steps per unit time. Therefore, the car's speed is 4 steps per unit time.

   Notice that \(4321\) is a prime number and does not share any common factors with \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\). Therefore, the fraction is already in its simplest form.

2. **Convert the fraction to a decimal:**
   To convert \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) to a decimal, we first calculate the denominator:
   \[
   5^7 = 78125 \quad \text{and} \quad 2^8 = 256

First, note that \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). Therefore, we can rewrite the product as:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ.

This simplifies to:
\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2.

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for the product \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\). We can apply this identity to the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\).

First, consider the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). Using the identity, we get:
\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Now, we need to include \(\sin 60^\circ\), which is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Therefore, the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ\) is:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right) \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{3}{16}.

Finally, consider the term \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\). This can be rewritten using the identity \(\csc^2 x = 1 + \cot^2 x\):
\[
\frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = \csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we can rewrite the original expression as:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ).
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

We need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). Using the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), we have:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} \quad \text{and} \quad \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\) for \(x = 10^\circ\), we can find that \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), which gives us a relationship between \(\tan 10^\circ\), \(\tan 20^\circ\), and \(\tan 40^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12\).

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
3 + 12 = 15.

"1. **Understanding the problem:**
   - We are given a polygon with an exterior angle sum of \(1070^\circ\).
   - We need to determine the number of sides of the polygon.

2. **Recall the property of polygons:**
   - The sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \(360^\circ\).

3. **Set up the equation:**
   - Let \(n\) be the number of sides of the polygon.
   - Each exterior angle of a regular polygon is given by \(\frac{360^\circ}{n}\).

4. **Given information:**
   - The sum of the exterior angles is \(1070^\circ\).

5. **Formulate the equation:**
   - Since the sum of the exterior angles is \(360^\circ\), we can write:
     \[
     n \times \frac{360^\circ}{n} = 1070^\circ
     \]

6. **Simplify the equation:**
   - The \(n\) in the numerator and denominator cancel out:
     \[
     360^\circ = 1070^\circ
     \]

7. **Solve for \(n\):**
   - Divide both sides by \(360^\circ\):
     \[
     n = \frac{1070^\circ}{360^\circ}
     \]

8. **Perform the division:**
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     n = \frac{1070}{360} \approx 2.9722
     \]

9. **Interpret the result:**
   - Since \(n\) must be an integer (as it represents the number of sides of a polygon), we need to re-evaluate our approach.
   - The given sum of \(1070^\circ\) suggests that the polygon is not regular, and the problem might involve a different interpretation or a mistake in the problem statement.

10. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
    - If the problem is about finding the number of sides of a polygon with a given exterior angle sum, we need to consider the possibility of a different geometric property or a different interpretation of the problem.

11. **Conclusion:**
    - Given the standard property of polygons, the problem might need a recheck or a different approach. However, based on the standard property, the sum of exterior angles is always \(360^\circ\), and the problem might involve a different geometric context.

"1. **Define the problem in terms of modular arithmetic:**
   We need to find an integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \).

2. **Set up the congruence equation:**
   \[
   t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23}
   \]

3. **Subtract \( t \) from both sides of the congruence:**
   \[
   t + 2 - t \equiv t - t \pmod{23}
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

5. **Interpret the simplified congruence:**
   The congruence \( 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \) is not true because 2 is not divisible by 23. This indicates that there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem.

6. **Re-evaluate the problem statement:**
   The problem states that \( t + 2 \) should be congruent to \( t \) modulo 23. This implies that \( t + 2 \) and \( t \) should have the same remainder when divided by 23.

7. **Reformulate the problem:**
   We need to find \( t \) such that:
   \[
   t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23}
   \]

8. **Solve the congruence:**
   \[
   t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23}
   \]
   Subtract \( t \) from both sides:
   \[
   2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]

9. **Correct interpretation:**
   The correct interpretation should be that \( t + 2 \) and \( t \) should differ by a multiple of 23. Therefore, we need:
   \[
   t + 2 = t + 23k \quad \text{for some integer } k
   \]

10. **Solve for \( t \):**
    \[
    t + 2 = t + 23k
    \]
    Subtract \( t \) from both sides:
    \[
    2 = 23k
    \]

11. **Find the integer solution:**
    Since \( 2 \) is not a multiple of \( 23 \), there is no integer \( k \) that satisfies this equation. Therefore, there is no integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \).

"To find the product of the conjugate surds \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the conjugate of the given surd. The conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).
2. Multiply the given surd by its conjugate. This means we need to calculate \((5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})\).

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.

Let's start with step 1: Evaluate \( f(5) \).
The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7. \]

Next, step 2: Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
We have \( f(5) = 7 \), so:

Finally, step 3: Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.
The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any non-zero real number \(x\),

\[
\tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

This identity can be derived from the fact that \(\cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \tan^{-1} (x)\) when \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, the original equation simplifies to:

"To determine if the two lines are parallel, we need to check if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can see that \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). This means that the direction vector of the second line is exactly twice the direction vector of the first line. Therefore, the two lines are parallel.

Next, we need to find the point of intersection of the two lines if they are not parallel. However, since we have already determined that the lines are parallel, they do not intersect unless they are the same line. To check if they are the same line, we need to see if there is a value of \(t\) such that the point on the first line is equal to the point on the second line.

The parametric equations for the first line are:
\[x = 3 + 2t,\]
\[y = -10 - 9t,\]
\[z = 1 - 2t.\]

The parametric equations for the second line are:
\[x = -5 + 4u,\]
\[y = -3 - 18u,\]
\[z = 6 - 4u.\]

We need to solve the system of equations:
\[3 + 2t = -5 + 4u,\]
\[-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u,\]
\[1 - 2t = 6 - 4u.\]

First, solve the first equation for \(t\):
\[3 + 2t = -5 + 4u,\]
\[2t = -8 + 4u,\]
\[t = -4 + 2u.\]

Next, substitute \(t = -4 + 2u\) into the second equation:
\[-10 - 9(-4 + 2u) = -3 - 18u,\]
\[-10 + 36 - 18u = -3 - 18u,\]
\[26 = -3,\]
which is a contradiction. Therefore, there is no value of \(t\) and \(u\) that satisfies all three equations simultaneously, meaning the lines do not intersect.

Since the lines are parallel and do not intersect, they are skew lines. However, the problem asks for the point of intersection, which does not exist for skew lines. The correct interpretation is that the lines are parallel and do not intersect.

The answer is that the lines are parallel and do not intersect. The point of intersection does not exist.

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\), the expression simplifies to:

\[

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\). Therefore, we have:

\[

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by moving all terms involving \(x\) to one side of the equation:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplifying, we get:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]
   Dividing both sides by \(-19\), we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

4. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the expression \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given operation \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions:
   \[
   \frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}
   \]
   So, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\).

2. Substitute these values into the operation formula:
   \[
   \frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
   \]

3. Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   \frac{21}{30} = \frac{7 \cdot 3}{10 \cdot 3} = \frac{7}{10}
   \]
   So the expression becomes:
   \[
   (7)(10)\left(\frac{7}{10}\right)

4. Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   (7)(10)\left(\frac{7}{10}\right) = 7 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{7}{10} = 7 \cdot 7 = 49

   - The speed of the car is \(\frac{5}{12}\) times the speed of the car on the path.
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle we need to find.

   - The point \(D\) is the center of the smaller circle.
   - The point \(A\) is on the circumference of the larger circle.
   - The point \(C\) is on the circumference of the smaller circle.
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle between the line segments \(AD\) and \(CD\).

3. **Use the properties of the circles:**
   - Since \(D\) is the center of the smaller circle, \(AD = c\) and \(CD = a\).
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle between the radii of the two circles.

4. **Determine the measure of the angle:**
   - The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the angle between the radii of the two circles, which is the same as the angle between the tangents to the circles at the point of tangency.
   - The angle between the tangents to two circles is given by the formula:
     \[

   - However, in this specific problem, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is simply the angle between the radii of the two circles, which is \(90^\circ\) because the circles are tangent to each other at point \(D\).

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \beta \sin \alpha = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} - \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10}

Now, we need to find the product of these two sines:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \left( \frac{\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}}{10} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3})}{100}
\]

We use the difference of squares formula:
\[
(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21})(\sqrt{21} - 2 \sqrt{3}) = (\sqrt{21})^2 - (2 \sqrt{3})^2 = 21 - 4 \cdot 3 = 21 - 12 = 9
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

"To determine how many times we can play a game with 5 pieces of a game from a set of 8 points and 6 double points, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of points available:**
   - Each point is worth 1 point.
   - Each double point is worth 2 points.
   - Total points from points: \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points.
   - Total points from double points: \( 6 \times 2 = 12 \) points.
   - Total points available: \( 8 + 12 = 20 \) points.

2. **Determine the number of points needed for one game:**

   - Since there are 2 players, you need \( 1 + 1 = 2 \) points per game.

3. **Calculate the number of games that can be played with 5 pieces of a game:**

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes to complete one of the three last centerpieces. Let's denote the time it takes to complete one of the three last centerpieces as \( t \) minutes.

First, we know that the total time to complete all three centerpieces is 120 minutes. Therefore, the total time to complete the first three centerpieces is:
\[ 120 - 3t \text{ minutes} \]

Next, we know that the average time to complete one of the three centerpieces is 24 minutes. Therefore, the total time to complete all three centerpieces is also:
\[ 3 \times 24 = 72 \text{ minutes} \]

Since the total time to complete all three centerpieces is the same, we can set up the following equation:

Now, we solve for \( t \):
\[ 120 - 72 = 3t \]
\[ 48 = 3t \]
\[ t = \frac{48}{3} \]

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we will follow these steps:

1. Simplify the expression inside the cube root.
2. Eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation.
3. Solve the resulting quadratic equation.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the cube root. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square:
\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = (x - 2)^2
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:
\[
(\sqrt[3]{(x - 2)^2})^3 = 16^3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

Now, solve the quadratic equation \((x - 2)^2 = 4096\). Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]
Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:
\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations gives us:
\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Therefore, the solutions to the equation are:
\[
x = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -62

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are powers of 2. Specifically, we know that:

\]

This identity can be derived from the more general product-to-sum identities and properties of roots of unity in complex analysis, but for the purpose of this problem, we can use it directly. Therefore, we have:

"给定三角形 \(ABC\)，其中 \(AB = AC\)，\(AM = 11\)，且 \(AD = 10\)，我们需要找到三角形 \(ABC\) 的周长，已知 \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\)。

首先，设 \(\angle BAC = \theta\)。那么，\(\angle BDC = 3\theta\)。由于 \(AB = AC\)，\(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\)。

考虑三角形 \(BDC\)。由于 \(D\) 在 \(AM\) 上，且 \(AM\) 是从 \(A\) 到 \(BC\) 的高，\(\angle BDM = \angleCDM = 90^\circ - \theta\)。因此，\(\angle BDC = 180^\circ - 2(90^\circ - \theta) = 2\theta\)。已知 \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\)，我们有 \(2\theta = 3\theta\)，这意味着 \(\theta = 36^\circ\)。因此，\(\angle BAC = 36^\circ\)，\(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = 72^\circ\)。

现在，考虑三角形 \(ABM\)。由于 \(AM\) 是高，\(\angle AMB = 90^\circ\)。设 \(BM = CM = x\)。那么，在三角形 \(ABM\) 中，我们有：
\[AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.\]
同样，在三角形 \(ACM\) 中，我们有：
\[AC^2 = AM^2 + CM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.\]
由于 \(AB = AC\)，我们有：
\[AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2}.\]
在三角形 \(ABC\) 中，我们有：
\[BC = 2x.\]
三角形 \(ABC\) 的周长为：
\[AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{121 + x^2} + \sqrt{121 + x^2} + 2x = 2\sqrt{121 + x^2} + 2x.\]
为了找到 \(x\)，我们使用 \(\angle BAC = 36^\circ\) 的事实。在三角形 \(ABC\) 中使用余弦定理：
\[BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos(36^\circ).\]
由于 \(AB = AC\)，我们有：
\[BC^2 = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos(36^\circ)).\]
我们知道 \(\cos(36^\circ) = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}\)，所以：
\[BC^2 = 2(121 + x^2) \left(1 - \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{4}\right) = 2(121 + x^2) \left(\frac{4 - \sqrt{5} - 1}{4}\right) = 2(121 + x^2) \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{4}\right) = (121 + x^2) \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right).\]
由于 \(BC = 2x\)，我们有：
\[4x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left(\frac{3 - \sqrt{5}}{2}\right).\]
解 \(x^2\)，我们得到：
\[8x^2 = (121 + x^2)(3 - \sqrt{5}).\]
展开并重新排列项，我们得到：
\[8x^2 = 363 - 121\sqrt{5} + 3x^2 - x^2\sqrt{5}.\]
\[5x^2 + x^2\sqrt{5} = 363 - 121\sqrt{5}.\]
\[x^2(5 + \sqrt{5}) = 363 - 121\sqrt{5}.\]
\[x^2 = \frac{363 - 121\sqrt{5}}{5 + \sqrt{5}}.\]
有理化分母，我们得到：
\[x^2 = \frac{(363 - 121\sqrt{5})(5 - \sqrt{5})}{(5 + \sqrt{5})(5 - \sqrt{5})} = \frac{1815 - 363\sqrt{5} - 605\sqrt{5} + 605}{25 - 5} = \frac{2420 - 968\sqrt{5}}{20} = 121 - 48.4\sqrt{5}.\]
因此，\(x = \sqrt{121 - 48.4\sqrt{5}} = 5\sqrt{5} - 11\)。

最后，三角形 \(ABC\) 的周长为：
\[2\sqrt{121 + (5\sqrt{5} - 11)^2} + 2(5\sqrt{5} - 11) = 2\sqrt{121 + 121 - 110\sqrt{5} + 121} + 10\sqrt{5} - 22 = 2\sqrt{363 - 110\sqrt{5}} + 10\sqrt{5} - 22 = 2(5\sqrt{5} - 11) + 10\sqrt{5} - 22 = 10\sqrt{5} - 22 + 10\sqrt{5} - 22 = 44.\]

   Using the logarithm power rule \(\log_b (a^c) = c \log_b a\), we get:
   \[
   \log_{10} (3^7) = 7 \log_{10} 3
   \]

3. **Approximate \(\log_{10} 3\):**

   We know that \(\log_{10} 3 \approx 0.4771\). Substituting this value in, we get:
   \[
   7 \log_{10} 3 \approx 7 \times 0.4771 = 3.3397
   \]

4. **Determine the number of digits:**

   Now, we find the number of digits by taking the floor of 3.3397 and adding 1:
   \[
   d = \lfloor 3.3397 \rfloor + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   Therefore, the number \(3^7\) has 4 digits. Since the problem states that the number of digits is ""-nimely-ne adjacent,"" it implies that the number of digits is exactly 4.

"1. **Define the function:**
   Let \( f(x) = x^4 + 4x^2 \).

2. **Find the critical points:**
   To find the critical points, we need to compute the first derivative of \( f(x) \) and set it to zero.
   \[
   f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(x^4 + 4x^2) = 4x^3 + 8x
   \]
   Set the first derivative equal to zero:
   \[
   4x^3 + 8x = 0
   \]
   Factor out the common term \( 4x \):
   \[
   4x(x^2 + 2) = 0
   \]
   Solve for \( x \):
   \[
   4x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = -2
   \]
   Since \( x^2 = -2 \) has no real solutions, the only critical point is:
   \[
   x = 0
   \]

3. **Determine the nature of the critical point:**
   To determine whether \( x = 0 \) is a minimum or maximum, we use the second derivative test. Compute the second derivative of \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f''(x) = \frac{d}{dx}(4x^3 + 8x) = 12x^2 + 8
   \]
   Evaluate the second derivative at \( x = 0 \):
   \[
   f''(0) = 12(0)^2 + 8 = 8
   \]
   Since \( f''(0) > 0 \), the function \( f(x) \) has a local minimum at \( x = 0 \).

4. **Evaluate the function at the critical point:**
   \[
   f(0) = 0^4 + 4(0)^2 = 0
   \]

5. **Analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \to \pm \infty \):**
   As \( x \to \pm \infty \), \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) both approach \( +\infty \). Therefore:
   \[
   \lim_{x \to \pm \infty} f(x) = +\infty
   \]

6. **Determine the range of \( f(x) \):**
   Since \( f(x) \) has a local minimum at \( x = 0 \) with \( f(0) = 0 \) and \( f(x) \to +\infty \) as \( x \to \pm \infty \), the range of \( f(x) \) is:
   \[
   [0, +\infty)
   \]

7. **Solve the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \):**
   We need to find the values of \( x \) such that:
   \[
   -4 < f(x) < 21
   \]
   Since \( f(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \), the left inequality \( -4 < f(x) \) is always true. Therefore, we only need to solve:
   \[
   f(x) < 21
   \]
   This translates to:
   \[
   x^4 + 4x^2 < 21
   \]

8. **Solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \):**
   Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y < 21
   \]
   Rearrange the inequality:
   \[
   y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
   \]
   Solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
   \[
   y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}
   \]
   This gives us two solutions:
   \[
   y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7
   \]
   Since \( y = x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard \( y = -7 \). Therefore, the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) holds for:
   \[
   0 \leq y < 3
   \]
   Substituting back \( y = x^2 \):
   \[
   0 \leq x^2 < 3
   \]
   Taking the square root of all parts:
   \[
   -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
   \]

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the identity for the square of a sum:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the second given equation that:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
or:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
Now, we use the third given equation:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x + y + z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-x) + yz(s-y) + zx(s-z) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - (x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x) = 12.
\]
Since \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we have:
\[
sp - (x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x) = 12.
\]
We need to find a way to express \(x^2 y + y^2 z + z^2 x\) in terms of \(s\) and \(p\). However, we can use the fact that the equations are symmetric and try specific values. Let's assume \(x = 2\), \(y = 1\), and \(z = 2\). Then:
\[
xyz = 2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2 = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 2^3 + 1^3 + 2^3 = 8 + 1 + 8 = 17 \neq 4.
\]
This assumption is incorrect. Let's try another approach. From the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we can test possible values. If we assume \(s = 0\), then:
\[
-8 = 0(0^2 - 3p) = 0,
\]
which is not possible. If we assume \(s = 2\), then:
\[
-8 = 2(2^2 - 3p) = 2(4 - 3p) = 8 - 6p,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = 8 - 6p,
\]
or:
\[
-16 = -6p,
\]
or:
\[
p = \frac{8}{3}.
\]
However, this does not satisfy the original equations. Let's try \(s = -2\):
\[
-8 = -2((-2)^2 - 3p) = -2(4 - 3p) = -8 + 6p,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = -8 + 6p,
\]
or:
\[
0 = 6p,
\]
or:
\[
p = 0.

This satisfies the original equations. Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where the fraction is negative.

First, let's factor the numerator and the denominator:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|\]
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\]

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative when \(x\) is between 0 and 36, i.e., \(0 < x < 36\). However, we must exclude the points where the denominator is zero, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how much faster the cat is compared to the mouse and then use that information to find out how much faster the cat is compared to the cat.

First, let's define the speeds of the mouse and the cat. Let the speed of the mouse be \( m \) meters per second. According to the problem, the cat is 400 meters per second faster than the mouse. Therefore, the speed of the cat is \( m + 400 \) meters per second.

Next, we need to determine the time it takes for the mouse to run around the perimeter of the table. The table is a rectangle with a length of 3 meters and a width of 2 meters. The perimeter of the table is calculated as follows:
\[
2 \times (3 + 2) = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ meters}
\]
The time it takes for the mouse to run around the perimeter is the perimeter divided by the mouse's speed:
\[
\text{Time for mouse} = \frac{10}{m} \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we need to determine the time it takes for the cat to run around the perimeter of the table. The time it takes for the cat to run around the perimeter is the perimeter divided by the cat's speed:
\[
\text{Time for cat} = \frac{10}{m + 400} \text{ seconds}
\]

According to the problem, the cat runs around the perimeter in half the time it takes the mouse. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[
\frac{10}{m + 400} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{10}{m}
\]
Simplifying the right side of the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{10}{m + 400} = \frac{5}{m}
\]
To solve for \( m \), we can cross-multiply:
\[
10m = 5(m + 400)
\]
Expanding the right side, we get:
\[
10m = 5m + 2000
\]
Subtracting \( 5m \) from both sides, we get:
\[
5m = 2000
\]
Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
\[
m = 400
\]
So, the speed of the mouse is 400 meters per second. Therefore, the speed of the cat is:
\[
m + 400 = 400 + 400 = 800 \text{ meters per second}
\]

Finally, we need to determine how much faster the cat is compared to the mouse. The difference in their speeds is:
\[
800 - 400 = 400 \text{ meters per second}
\]

To find out how much faster the cat is compared to the mouse in terms of the distance it can run in the same amount of time, we need to consider the time it takes for the mouse to run around the perimeter, which is:
\[
\frac{10}{400} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ seconds}
\]
In this time, the cat can run:
\[
800 \times \frac{1}{40} = 20 \text{ meters}
\]

Therefore, the cat is \(\boxed{20}\) meters faster than the mouse in the same amount of time it takes the mouse to run around the perimeter of the table.","[20, '20']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],True
"Given that \(\sin R = \frac{2}{5}\) in \(\triangle RST\) and \(\angle RST\) is a right angle, we need to find \(\sin T\).

First, recall that in a right triangle, the sine of an angle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the hypotenuse. Since \(\angle RST\) is a right angle, \(\angle R\) and \(\angle T\) are complementary angles, meaning \(\angle R + \angle T = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\sin T = \cos R\).

We know that \(\sin R = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{2}{5}\). In this right triangle, the side opposite \(\angle R\) is 2 and the hypotenuse is 5. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the adjacent side to \(\angle R\), which is also the opposite side to \(\angle T\).

The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
\text{hypotenuse}^2 = \text{opposite}^2 + \text{adjacent}^2

### Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)
For \( x \leq 3 \), the function is given by \( f(x) = 3 - x \).

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(0) \)

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)

This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. We solve the quadratic equation:

The solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid in this case.

#### Finding \( f^{-1}(6) \)
We set \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0
\]
We test possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
-(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0
\]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root, but it does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). We need to check if there are any other real roots, but since the problem is asking for the sum of the values and we have already found valid solutions in the first case, we can conclude that the only valid solutions are from the first case.

### Summing the Solutions
From the first case, we have \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \) and \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \). Therefore,
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0
\]

The final answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( P \), the speed of Rraction, and then find the difference between \( P \) and the average speed of the other five speeds (3, 7, 8, 9, and 11).

First, let's calculate the average speed of the other five speeds:
\[
\text{Average speed} = \frac{3 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 11}{5} = \frac{48}{5} = 9.6
\]

Next, we need to find the speed of Rraction, \( P \). According to the problem, Rraction's speed is such that it is equal to the average speed of the other five speeds plus 3. Therefore, we have:
\[
P = 9.6 + 3 = 12.6
\]

Now, we need to find the difference between Rraction's speed and the average speed of the other five speeds:
\[
P - \text{Average speed} = 12.6 - 9.6 = 3
\]

Thus, the difference between Rraction's speed and the average speed of the other five speeds is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To solve this problem, we need to determine the speed of the car in kilometers per hour (km/h) based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - The weight of the bag with the fruit on it is 200 grams.
   - The weight of the bag with the fruit on it is 150 grams.
   - The difference in weight between the two bags is 50 grams.
   - The difference in speed between the car and the car's speed is 20 km/h.

2. **Set up the relationship between the weights and the speeds:**
   The problem states that the difference in speed is 20 km/h. This means that the speed of the car is 20 km/h faster than the speed of the car's speed. Let's denote the speed of the car as \( v \) km/h. According to the problem, the speed of the car is 20 km/h faster than the speed of the car's speed, so we can write:
   \[
   v = \text{speed of the car's speed} + 20
   \]

3. **Determine the speed of the car's speed:**
   The problem also states that the difference in weight between the two bags is 50 grams. This difference in weight is due to the difference in speed between the car and the car's speed. Since the weight of the bag is directly proportional to the speed of the car, we can set up the following proportion:
   \[
   \frac{200 \text{ grams}}{150 \text{ grams}} = \frac{v}{\text{speed of the car's speed}}
   \]
   Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:
   \[
   \frac{4}{3} = \frac{v}{\text{speed of the car's speed}}
   \]
   This means that the speed of the car is \(\frac{4}{3}\) times the speed of the car's speed. Let's denote the speed of the car's speed as \( s \) km/h. Then we have:
   \[
   v = \frac{4}{3} s
   \]
   We also know from the problem that:
   \[
   v = s + 20
   \]
   So we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{4}{3} s = s + 20
   \]
   To solve for \( s \), we first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 3:
   \[
   4s = 3s + 60
   \]
   Subtracting \( 3s \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = 60
   \]
   So the speed of the car's speed is 60 km/h. Now we can find the speed of the car:
   \[
   v = \frac{4}{3} \times 60 = 80 \text{ km/h}
   \]

Therefore, the speed of the car is \(\boxed{80}\) km/h.","[80, '80']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"1. **Converting \( 629_{10} \) to base 8:**

   To convert the decimal number \( 629 \) to base 8, we repeatedly divide by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

   \[
   629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
   \]
   \[
   78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
   \]
   \[
   9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]
   \[
   1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]

   Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \( 629_{10} = 1165_8 \).

2. **Converting \( 121_3 \) and \( 413_5 \) to decimal:**

   - For \( 121_3 \):
     \[
     121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 2 \cdot 3 + 1 \cdot 1 = 9 + 6 + 1 = 16_{10}
     \]

   - For \( 413_5 \):
     \[
     413_5 = 4 \cdot 5^2 + 1 \cdot 5^1 + 3 \cdot 5^0 = 4 \cdot 25 + 1 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot 1 = 100 + 5 + 3 = 108_{10}
     \]

3. **Adding the decimal equivalents:**

   \[
   16_{10} + 108_{10} = 124_{10}
   \]

4. **Converting \( 124_{10} \) to base 8:**

   To convert \( 124 \) to base 8, we repeatedly divide by 8 and keep track of the remainders.

   \[
   124 \div 8 = 15 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 4
   \]
   \[
   15 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 7
   \]
   \[
   1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]

   Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \( 124_{10} = 174_8 \).

5. **Comparing the results:**

   - The base 8 representation of \( 629_{10} \) is \( 1165_8 \).
   - The sum of \( 121_3 \) and \( 413_5 \) in decimal is \( 124_{10} \), which is \( 174_8 \).

   Since \( 1165_8 \) and \( 174_8 \) are different, the sum of \( 121_3 \) and \( 413_5 \) is indeed \( 174_8 \).

"1. **defining the function \( f(x) \):**
   Given the polynomial function:
   \[
   f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2
   \]

2. **defining the function \( f(x-1) \):**
   To find \( f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):
   \[
   f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2
   \]

3. **expanding \( f(x-1) \):**
   We need to expand each term separately:
   \[
   (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
   \]
   \[
   (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
   \]
   Substituting these expansions back into \( f(x-1) \):
   \[
   f(x-1) = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) + 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 9(x-1) - 2
   \]
   \[
   = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2
   \]
   \[
   = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
   \]

4. **defining the function \( g(x) \):**
   The function \( g(x) \) is given as the polynomial \( f(x-1) \):
   \[
   g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
   \]

5. **determining the degree of \( g(x) \):**
   The degree of \( g(x) \) is the highest power of \( x \) in the polynomial, which is 4.

6. **determining the leading coefficient of \( g(x) \):**
   The leading coefficient is the coefficient of the term with the highest degree, which is 3.

7. **determining the degree of \( f(x) \):**
   The degree of \( f(x) \) is also 4.

8. **determining the leading coefficient of \( f(x) \):**
   The leading coefficient of \( f(x) \) is 3.

9. **determining the ratio of the leading coefficients:**
   The ratio of the leading coefficients of \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{leading coefficient of } g(x)}{\text{leading coefficient of } f(x)} = \frac{3}{3} = 1
   \]

10. **determining the ratio of the degrees:**
    The ratio of the degrees of \( g(x) \) and \( f(x) \) is:
    \[
    \frac{\text{degree of } g(x)}{\text{degree of } f(x)} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
    \]

11. **conclusion:**
    Since the ratio of the leading coefficients and the ratio of the degrees are both 1, the polynomial \( g(x) \) is a monomial that is a constant multiple of \( f(x) \). Therefore, \( g(x) \) is a constant multiple of \( f(x) \).

    Hence, the polynomial \( g(x) \) is a constant multiple of \( f(x) \), and the constant of proportionality is 1.

"给定多项式 \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\)，其根为 \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\)，我们需要找到表达式 \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) 的值。

首先，我们使用韦达定理，它告诉我们对于多项式 \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\)，根的和与积由以下给出：
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

我们需要找到表达式 \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), 和 \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) 的值。为此，我们使用根的两两积的和可以表示为根的积的和与根的和的函数这一事实。具体来说，我们有：
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3).
\]

然而，一个更简单的方法是使用根的两两积的和可以表示为根的积的和与根的和的函数这一事实。具体来说，我们有：
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) - \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]

由于 \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\) 和 \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)，我们有：
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (-2)(2) - 2(-2) = -4 + 4 = 0.
\]

因此，表达式 \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) 的值是 \(\boxed{0}\)。","[0, '0']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False
"Let's denote the cost of onemonogram by \( m \) dollars, the cost of one eel by \( e \) dollars, and the cost of one glass by \( g \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

1. \( 3m + e + g = 1.24 \)
2. \( m + e + 2g = 1.82 \)

We need to find the cost of one monogram, \( m \). To do this, we can eliminate \( e \) and \( g \) by manipulating these equations. First, let's subtract the second equation from the first:

\[
(3m + e + g) - (m + e + 2g) = 1.24 - 1.82
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
3m + e + g - m - e - 2g = 1.24 - 1.82
\]

\[
2m - g = -0.58
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
2m = g - 0.58
\]

\[
g = 2m + 0.58
\]

Now we substitute \( g = 2m + 0.58 \) back into the first equation:

\[
3m + e + (2m + 0.58) = 1.24
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
5m + e + 0.58 = 1.24
\]

Subtracting 0.58 from both sides, we get:

\[
5m + e = 0.66
\]

Now we have a new equation:

\[
e = 0.66 - 5m
\]

We can substitute \( e = 0.66 - 5m \) and \( g = 2m + 0.58 \) into the second original equation to verify and solve for \( m \):

\[
m + (0.66 - 5m) + 2(2m + 0.58) = 1.82
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses and combining like terms, we get:

\[
m + 0.66 - 5m + 4m + 1.16 = 1.82
\]

\[
m - 5m + 4m + 0.66 + 1.16 = 1.82
\]

\[
0m + 1.82 = 1.82
\]

This is an identity, which means our expressions for \( e \) and \( g \) in terms of \( m \) are correct. To find the specific value of \( m \), we can use the fact that the total cost of one monogram, one eel, and one glass is consistent with the given equations. Since the equations are consistent, we can solve for \( m \) directly from the simplified form of the equations.

From \( 2m = g - 0.58 \), we can see that \( g = 2m + 0.58 \). Substituting \( g = 2m + 0.58 \) into the first equation, we get:

\[
3m + e + (2m + 0.58) = 1.24
\]

\[
5m + e + 0.58 = 1.24
\]

\[
5m + e = 0.66
\]

\[
e = 0.66 - 5m
\]

Substituting \( e = 0.66 - 5m \) and \( g = 2m + 0.58 \) into the second equation, we get:

\[
m + (0.66 - 5m) + 2(2m + 0.58) = 1.82
\]

\[
m + 0.66 - 5m + 4m + 1.16 = 1.82
\]

\[
m - 5m + 4m + 0.66 + 1.16 = 1.82
\]

\[
0m + 1.82 = 1.82
\]

\]

\[
e = 0.66 - 5m
\]

Substituting \( e = 0.66 - 5m \) and \( g = 2m + 0.58 \) into the second equation, we get:

\[
m + (0.66 - 5m) + 2(2m + 0.58) = 1.82
\]

\[
m + 0.66 - 5m + 4m + 1.16 = 1.82

   - \(137 \div 500 = 0.274\).

3. **Interpreting the Result:**
   - The decimal \(0.274\) represents the fraction of a minute.
   - Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we multiply \(0.274\) by 60 to find the number of seconds.

4. **Calculating the Number of Seconds:**
   - \(0.274 \times 60 = 16.44\).

5. **Rounding to the Nearest Second:**
   - Since we are asked for the number of seconds, we round \(16.44\) to the nearest whole number, which is \(16\).

   - The quotient is the number of times 6 fits into 54, which is 9.
   - The remainder is what is left after subtracting the product of the quotient and the divisor from the dividend. In this case:
     \[
     54 - (6 \times 9) = 54 - 54 = 0

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ute } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ute } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \), the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( 1.0472 \) is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \). Since \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \), the largest integer less than or equal to \( 6.708 \) is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( 8^{2/3} \). Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), the largest integer less than or equal to 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

1. Calculate the total profit from selling all four products.
2. Determine the profit from each product sold at a discount.
3. Identify the products that were sold at a discount and calculate the total profit from these sales.
4. Compare the total profit from the sales at a discount with the total profit from all four products to find the number of pairs sold at a profit greater than the profit from a single product sold at a discount.

Let's start with the first step:

1. Calculate the total profit from selling all four products:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.60
   \]

2. Determine the profit from each product sold at a discount. Since the problem does not specify which products were sold at a discount, we will assume that all products were sold at a discount. Therefore, the profit from each product sold at a discount is the same as the profit from each product sold.

3. Identify the products that were sold at a discount and calculate the total profit from these sales. Since all products were sold at a discount, the total profit from the sales at a discount is the same as the total profit from all four products, which is $126.60.

4. Compare the total profit from the sales at a discount with the total profit from all four products to find the number of pairs sold at a profit greater than the profit from a single product sold at a discount. Since all products were sold at a discount, the profit from each product sold at a discount is the same as the profit from each product sold. Therefore, the number of pairs sold at a profit greater than the profit from a single product sold at a discount is the number of pairs of products sold, which is 2 (since there are 4 products and they form 2 pairs).

Thus, the number of pairs of products sold at a profit greater than the profit from a single product sold at a discount is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",59,"[59, '59']",False

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal of the given 3x3 grid is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

The grid is as follows:
\[

\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline

\hline
\end{array}
\]

First, let's find the sum of the first row:
\[
S = (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's find the sum of the first column:
\[
S = (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

Now, let's find the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
S = (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 4n - 13
\]

Since all these sums must be equal, we can set up the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 4n - 13
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 4n - 13
\]
\[
1 + 13 = 4n - 2n
\]
\[
14 = 2n
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sum of the second row:
\[
S = 3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

And the sum of the second column:
\[
S = 3 + (n+2) + n = 3 + (7+2) + 7 = 3 + 9 + 7 = 19
\]

And the sum of the third column:
\[
S = (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15

And the sum of the main diagonal:
\[
S = (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

"1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of steps on the staircase that both Tim and Masha climbed.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of steps on the staircase that Masha climbed on the way down.

2. **Set up the equations based on the given information:**
   - Tim climbed the staircase in 300 steps, which is 400 steps longer than Masha. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     300 = x + 400
     \]
   - Masha climbed the staircase in 400 steps, which is 300 steps shorter than Tim. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     400 = x + 300
     \]

3. **Solve the first equation for \( x \):**
   \[
   300 = x + 400
   \]
   Subtract 400 from both sides:
   \[
   300 - 400 = x
   \]
   \[
   x = -100
   \]
   This result is not possible since the number of steps cannot be negative. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

4. **Re-evaluate the problem:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of steps on the staircase that both Tim and Masha climbed.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of steps on the staircase that Masha climbed on the way down.
   - Tim climbed the staircase in 300 steps, which is 400 steps longer than Masha. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     300 = x + 400
     \]
   - Masha climbed the staircase in 400 steps, which is 300 steps shorter than Tim. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     400 = x + 300
     \]

5. **Solve the second equation for \( x \):**
   \[
   400 = x + 300
   \]
   Subtract 300 from both sides:
   \[
   400 - 300 = x
   \]
   \[
   x = 100
   \]

6. **Determine the number of steps Masha climbed on the way down:**
   - Since Masha climbed the staircase in 400 steps, and we have already determined that \( x = 100 \), we can find \( y \) by subtracting \( x \) from 400:
     \[
     y = 400 - 100
     \]
     \[
     y = 300
     \]

7. **Calculate the total number of steps Masha climbed:**
   - Masha climbed \( x \) steps on the way up and \( y \) steps on the way down:
     \[
     \text{Total steps Masha climbed} = x + y
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total steps Masha climbed} = 100 + 300

我们需要找到 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) 的值。首先，让我们简化 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\)。使用 \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\)，我们得到：
\[
1 + \omega^2 = 1 + (-1 - \omega) = -\omega.
\]
因此，
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{-\omega} = -\frac{1}{\omega}.
\]
现在，我们需要找到 \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega}\)。使用恒等式 \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\)，我们可以表达 \(1 + \omega\) 为：
\[
1 + \omega = -\omega^2.
\]
因此，
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} = \frac{1}{-\omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2}.
\]
现在我们可以将两个分数相加：
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = -\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]
为了合并这些分数，我们需要一个公共分母：
\[
-\frac{1}{\omega^2} - \frac{1}{\omega} = -\left(\frac{1}{\omega^2} + \frac{1}{\omega}\right) = -\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{\omega^3}\right).
\]
由于 \(\omega^3 = 1\)，我们有：
\[
-\left(\frac{\omega + \omega^2}{1}\right) = -(\omega + \omega^2).
\]
从方程 \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\)，我们知道 \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\)。因此：
\[
-(\omega + \omega^2) = -(-1) = 1.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio in which point \(D\) divides the line segment \(AC\). Let's denote the coordinates of points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) as follows:
- \(A = (-3, 3)\)
- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -4)\)
- \(D = (0, 0)\)

We are given the following distances:
- \(AD = 5\)
- \(DB = 5\)
- \(AC = 6\)
- \(BC = 6\)

Since \(D\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), we can use the midpoint formula to verify this. The midpoint formula states that the coordinates of the midpoint \(M\) of a line segment joining points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) are given by:
\[
M = \left( \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} \right)

\[
D = \left( \frac{-3 + 0}{2}, \frac{3 + (-4)}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{-3}{2}, \frac{-1}{2} \right)
\]

However, we are given that \(D = (0, 0)\). This suggests that \(D\) is not the midpoint of \(AC\) in the usual sense, but rather it is a point on \(AC\) such that the distances \(AD\) and \(DC\) are equal. This implies that \(D\) divides \(AC\) in the ratio \(1:1\).

To confirm, we can use the section formula, which states that if a point \(D\) divides the line segment joining points \((x_1, y_1)\) and \((x_2, y_2)\) in the ratio \(m:n\), then the coordinates of \(D\) are:

D = \left( \frac{mx_2 + nx_1}{m+n}, \frac{my_2 + ny_1}{m+n} \right)
\]

Given \(AD = 5\) and \(DC = 6\), we can set up the following equations:
\[
AD = \sqrt{(0 - (-3))^2 + (0 - 3)^2} = \sqrt{9 + 9} = \sqrt{18} = 3\sqrt{2}
\]
\[
DC = \sqrt{(0 - 0)^2 + (0 - (-4))^2} = \sqrt{0 + 16} = 4
\]

Since \(AD = 5\) and \(DC = 6\), we need to find the ratio \(m:n\) such that:
\[
\frac{m}{n} = \frac{5}{6}
\]

Thus, the ratio in which \(D\) divides \(AC\) is:
\[
\boxed{1:1}
