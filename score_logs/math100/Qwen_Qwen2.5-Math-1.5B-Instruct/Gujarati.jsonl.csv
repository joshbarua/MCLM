"Given the right triangle \( \triangle DEF \) with \( \angle DFE = 90^\circ \), we know that \( \sin D = 0.7 \) and \( EF = 7 \). We need to find the length of \( DE \).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In \( \triangle DEF \), \( \angle D \) is opposite to side \( EF \) and the hypotenuse is \( DE \). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DE} = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
We are given that \( \sin D = 0.7 \), so we substitute this value into the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DE}
\]
To find \( DE \), we solve for \( DE \) by isolating it on one side of the equation. We do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( DE \) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:
\[
DE = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Thus, the length of \( DE \) is:
\[

"Given the complex numbers \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we need to find the complex number \( w \) such that the angle between \( z \) and \( c \) is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \).

First, let's express \( z \) and \( c \) in polar form. The polar form of a complex number \( a + bi \) is given by \( r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \), where \( r = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \) and \( \theta = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) \).

For \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \):
\[ r_z = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (-(3 + 3\sqrt{2}))^2} = \sqrt{(2 + \sqrt{2})^2 + (3 + 3\sqrt{2})^2} \]
\[ = \sqrt{4 + 4\sqrt{2} + 2 + 9 + 18\sqrt{2} + 18} = \sqrt{33 + 22\sqrt{2}} \]
\[ \theta_z = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-(3 + 3\sqrt{2})}{2 + \sqrt{2}}\right) \]

For \( c = 2 - 3i \):
\[ r_c = \sqrt{2^2 + (-3)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 9} = \sqrt{13} \]
\[ \theta_c = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{-3}{2}\right) \]

The angle between \( z \) and \( c \) is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). To find \( w \), we need to rotate \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \). The rotation of a complex number \( z \) around a point \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:
\[ w = c + (z - c)e^{i\theta} \]
Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Thus,
\[ w = c + (z - c)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \]
\[ w = 2 - 3i + \left((2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)\right)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \]
\[ w = 2 - 3i + (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i)\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \]
\[ w = 2 - 3i + \left(\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \]
\[ w = 2 - 3i + \left(1 + i - 3i + 3\right) \]
\[ w = 2 - 3i + (4 - 2i) \]

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we need to factorize 242 into its prime factors and then simplify the square root.

1. **Factorize 242:**
   - Start by checking if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \(242 \div 2 = 121\)
   - So, \(242 = 2 \times 121\)

2. **Factorize 121:**
   - Next, check if 121 is divisible by 2. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by 5. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by 7. It is not.
   - Check if 121 is divisible by 11.
   - \(121 \div 11 = 11\)
   - So, \(121 = 11 \times 11\)

3. **Combine the factors:**
   - Therefore, \(242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\)

4. **Simplify the square root:**
   - \(\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11}\)
   - Since \(\sqrt{a \times b \times c} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b \times c}\), we can rewrite it as:
   - \(\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11}\)
   - \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{11^2} = 11\)
   - So, \(\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11\)
   - \(\sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}\)

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is \(\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\).","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False

"To find the coefficient of the \(x^5\) term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x^5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

Simplifying the general term, we get:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be 5, so we set up the equation:

\[
15 - 5k = 5
\]

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 5 \implies 10 = 5k \implies k = 2
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 2\) back into the general term to find the coefficient of the \(x^5\) term:

\[
\binom{5}{2} 10^{5-2} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \binom{5}{2} 10^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 10 \cdot 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 10 \cdot 250 = 2500

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to show that \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 7k + 2 \) for some integer \( k \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
n + 2 = (7k + 2) + 2 = 7k + 4
\]
\[
n + 4 = (7k + 2) + 4 = 7k + 6
\]
\[
n + 6 = (7k + 2) + 6 = 7k + 8
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)
\]

Since each term in the product \((7k + 4)(7k + 6)(7k + 8)\) contains a factor of 7, the entire product is divisible by 7. Therefore, \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divisible by 7.

"To solve the problem, we need to analyze the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2 - 5x - 14} \) and determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that the function has vertical asymptotes at \(x = a\) and \(x = b\), and a horizontal asymptote at \(y = c\).

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, so we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
We can factorize the quadratic equation as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). This means \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function \( \frac{P(x)}{Q(x)} \) where \(P(x)\) and \(Q(x)\) are polynomials is determined by the degrees of the polynomials. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). Therefore, \(c = 0\).

First, observe that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten using the identity for the sum of a geometric series. Notice that:

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1}\]

This is because the sum of a geometric series \(a^2 + a + 1\) is equal to \(\frac{a^3 - 1}{a - 1}\) when \(a = 99\). Here, \(a = 99\), so we have:

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}\]

Now, let's calculate \(99^3\):

\[99^3 = (100 - 1)^3 = 100^3 - 3 \cdot 100^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 100 \cdot 1^2 - 1^3 = 1000000 - 30000 + 300 - 1 = 970299\]

So,

\[99^3 - 1 = 970299 - 1 = 970298\]

Now, we divide 970298 by 98:

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{970298}{98} = 9901\]

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{9801}\).","[9801, '9801']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False
"Given the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \), we need to find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\).

First, we need to find the operator norm (or the largest singular value) of the matrix \( A \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the square root of the largest eigenvalue of \( A^T A \).

Calculate \( A^T A \):
\[ A^T = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \]
\[ A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix} \]

Next, find the eigenvalues of \( A^T A \). The eigenvalues are the roots of the characteristic polynomial \(\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = 0\):
\[ \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0 \]
Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0\):
\[ \lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2} \]
So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = 16\) and \(\lambda_2 = 1\). The largest eigenvalue is 16, so the operator norm of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{16} = 4\).

Therefore, the smallest constant \( C \) such that \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) is \( C = 4 \).

The answer is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

The fifth roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(z^5 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0\). Since \(z \neq 1\), \(z\) must be a root of the polynomial \(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0\). Therefore, we have:

\[z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0.\]

We need to find the value of the expression \(z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2}\). First, note that since \(z^5 = 1\), we have \(z^4 = \frac{1}{z}\), \(z^3 = \frac{1}{z^2}\), and \(z^2 = \frac{1}{z^3}\). Thus, the expression can be rewritten as:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9 = 45

\[
8 \cdot 1 = 8

Adding these together:
\[

So, \(58_9 = 53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculating each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[

Adding these together:
\[

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we will proceed step by step.

First, recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). So, we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}.
\]
To combine these terms, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). So, we rewrite the second term with the common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Now, we can combine the fractions:
\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
Recall the Pythagorean identity, which states that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). So, we can substitute \(\cos^2 x\) for \(1 - \sin^2 x\):
\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}.
\]
We can simplify this by canceling one \(\cos x\) from the numerator and the denominator:
\[
\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the structure of the problem:**
   - We have a statement about a person's age and a series of conditions that must be satisfied.
   - The statement is: ""甲 (甲) is as old as B (乙) is in years, and B (乙) is as old as A (甲) is in years. A (甲) is 20 years old. What is B (乙)'s age?""

2. **Translate the statement into logical conditions:**
   - Let's denote A's age by \( A \) and B's age by \( B \).
   - The statement tells us that \( A = B \) and \( B = A \).
   - Additionally, we know that \( A = 20 \).

3. **Substitute the known value into the conditions:**
   - Since \( A = 20 \), we can substitute \( A \) with 20 in the condition \( A = B \).
   - This gives us \( 20 = B \).

"Given the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\), their product is given as \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). We need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) and then determine \(a + b\).

First, let's expand the product of the two polynomials:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, let's compute each term:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Next, we combine all these terms:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Now, we group the like terms together:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must be equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. For \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12

2. For \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26

3. For \(t^2\):
\[

\]

4. For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16

5. For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

Let's solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t\):
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b\) is:

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with a circumference of \(20\pi\).
   - We need to find the radius of the circle.
   - The circumference \(C\) of a circle is given by the formula \(C = 2\pi r\), where \(r\) is the radius.
   - Given \(C = 20\pi\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2\pi r = 20\pi
     \]
   - Solving for \(r\), we divide both sides by \(2\pi\):
     \[
     r = \frac{20\pi}{2\pi} = 10
     \]
   - So, the radius of the circle is \(10\).

2. **Finding the Area of the Circle:**
   - The area \(A\) of a circle is given by the formula \(A = \pi r^2\).
   - Substituting \(r = 10\) into the formula, we get:
     \[
     A = \pi (10)^2 = 100\pi

   - So, the area of the circle is \(100\pi\).

3. **Finding the Perimeter of the Square:**
   - The problem states that the perimeter of the square is equal to the circumference of the circle.
   - The perimeter \(P\) of a square is given by the formula \(P = 4s\), where \(s\) is the side length of the square.
   - Given \(P = 20\pi\), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     4s = 20\pi
     \]
   - Solving for \(s\), we divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     s = \frac{20\pi}{4} = 5\pi
     \]
   - So, the side length of the square is \(5\pi\).

4. **Finding the Area of the Square:**
   - The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula \(A = s^2\).
   - Substituting \(s = 5\pi\) into the formula, we get:
     \[
     A = (5\pi)^2 = 25\pi^2

   - So, the area of the square is \(25\pi^2\).

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the function \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) are equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

For \(f(x)\) to be continuous at \(x = a\), the following must hold:
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a).
\]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a.
\]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[
\lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3.
\]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[
a^2 + 2a = a^3.
\]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0.
\]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0.
\]

This gives us three possible solutions:
\[
a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1.
\]

However, we need to check if these values satisfy the condition that \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\). For \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\
0 & \text{if } x < 0,
\end{cases}
\]
which is clearly continuous at \(x = 0\).

For \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2,
\end{cases}
\]
which is continuous at \(x = 2\) because:
\[
\lim_{x \to 2^-} f(x) = 2 \cdot 2 + 4 = 8, \quad \lim_{x \to 2^+} f(x) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8, \quad f(2) = 2 \cdot 2^2 = 8.
\]

For \(a = -1\), the function becomes:
\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1,\\
-x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1,
\end{cases}
\]
which is continuous at \(x = -1\) because:
\[
\lim_{x \to -1^-} f(x) = -(-1) - 2 = -1, \quad \lim_{x \to -1^+} f(x) = -(-1)^2 = -1, \quad f(-1) = -(-1)^2 = -1.
\]

Therefore, the values of \(a\) that make the function \(f(x)\) continuous are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). The problem asks for the value of \(a\) that satisfies the condition, and since the problem does not specify a unique solution, we can choose any of these values. For the sake of a single answer, we can choose \(a = 2\).

The value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"Given the equation of the circle:

\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]

we need to rewrite it in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\) to identify the center and radius. To do this, we complete the square for both \(x\) and \(y\) terms.

First, consider the \(x\) terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(x\), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, consider the \(y\) terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \(y\), which is \(6\), divide by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \]
This can be written as:
\[ (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constants on the left side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle, the right side must be a positive number, which means \(34 - c > 0\). The standard form of the circle's equation is:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]
This tells us that the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

The problem states that the circle's radius is 1. Therefore, we set the radius equal to 1:
\[ \sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \]
Square both sides to solve for \(c\):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\) has a fixed point \(x\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\).

First, let's find the fixed points of \(f(x)\). A fixed point \(x\) satisfies \(f(x) = x\), so we solve:
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x - \lambda x^2 - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda - \lambda x - 1) = 0.
\]
Thus, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda - \lambda x - 1 = 0 \implies x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0, 1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality simplifies to:
\[
0 \leq \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies 1 \leq \lambda \leq 2.
\]
So, for \(\lambda\) in the interval \([1, 2]\), \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\).

Next, we need to check if there are any other values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x = 0\), then the equation is satisfied. For \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
This is a cubic equation in \(x\). For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have solutions other than the fixed points, the cubic equation must have roots in \([0, 1]\) that are not equal to the fixed points. However, the only way this can happen is if the function \(f(x)\) has a periodic point of period 2, which occurs when \(\lambda\) is in the interval \([0, 4]\) but not in \([1, 2]\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\) are:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ

We can use the angle addition formulas for cosine and sine. Notice that \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\) and \(\sin 50^\circ = \cos 40^\circ\). So the numerator becomes:

This can be rewritten using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ - 40^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos(-5^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ
\]

Now, let's simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]

Similarly, we can use the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine. Notice that \(\cos 50^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\) and \(\sin 50^\circ = \cos 40^\circ\). So the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ
\]

This can be rewritten using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 40^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \cos 40^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \sin(35^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ + \sin(-5^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 5^\circ
\]

So the original expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 5^\circ}
\]

Using the sum-to-product identities, we get:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 5^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 15^\circ \cos 10^\circ
\]

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 5^\circ = 2 \cos \left(\frac{25^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \sin \left(\frac{25^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 15^\circ \sin 10^\circ
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{2 \cos 15^\circ \cos 10^\circ}{2 \cos 15^\circ \sin 10^\circ} = \frac{\cos 10^\circ}{\sin 10^\circ} = \cot 10^\circ = \tan 80^\circ
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\theta\) is:

\[
\boxed{80^\circ}

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(42!\) and the prime \(5\), we calculate:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
Calculating each term:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]
Since higher powers of 5 (e.g., \(5^3 = 125\)) are greater than 42, their contributions are zero. Therefore, the total number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is:
\[
8 + 1 + 0 = 9

Thus, the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\) is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",9,"[9, '9']",True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Also, the function is defined for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) and the terms \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) are defined only when \( -1 \le y \le 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \), respectively.

To find the maximum value, we can consider the boundary values of \( x \) and \( y \). Let's evaluate \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the square \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\):

1. At \( (1, 1) \):
   \[
   f(1, 1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

2. At \( (1, -1) \):
   \[
   f(1, -1) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

3. At \( (-1, 1) \):
   \[
   f(-1, 1) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

4. At \( (-1, -1) \):
   \[
   f(-1, -1) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 0 = 0.
   \]

Next, we consider the points where \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \):

1. At \( (0, 0) \):
   \[
   f(0, 0) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0.
   \]

2. At \( (0, 1) \):
   \[
   f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1.
   \]

3. At \( (0, -1) \):
   \[
   f(0, -1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 + (-1) \cdot 1 = -1.
   \]

4. At \( (1, 0) \):
   \[
   f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 = 1.
   \]

5. At \( (-1, 0) \):
   \[
   f(-1, 0) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 1 + 0 = -1.
   \]

From the above evaluations, we see that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1. To confirm that this is indeed the maximum, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of the function. The function \( f(x, y) \) can be rewritten as:
\[
f(x, y) = \sqrt{x^2 (1 - y^2) + y^2 (1 - x^2)} = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - x^2 y^2}.
\]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 - x^2 y^2} \) is achieved when \( x^2 + y^2 - x^2 y^2 \) is maximized. The maximum value of \( x^2 + y^2 - x^2 y^2 \) is 1, which occurs when \( x = y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) or \( x = y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

Thus, the maximum value of the function is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that \( z \) is a root of the quadratic equation \( z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right) z + 1 = 0 \). The roots of this quadratic equation are the golden ratio \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \) and its reciprocal \( \frac{1}{\phi} = \frac{2}{1 + \sqrt{5}} = \frac{\sqrt{5} - 1}{2} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( \phi \) or \( \frac{1}{\phi} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). First, we note that \( \phi \) and \( \frac{1}{\phi} \) are roots of the equation \( z^2 = z + 1 \), which implies \( z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \) follows a recurrence relation. Specifically, if we let \( a_n = z^n + \frac{1}{z^n} \), then \( a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + a_n \) with initial conditions \( a_0 = 2 \) and \( a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \).

We can compute the first few terms of the sequence:
\[
a_0 = 2, \quad a_1 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \quad a_2 = a_1 + a_0 = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + 2 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]
Continuing this process, we find:
\[
a_3 = a_2 + a_1 = \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = 3 + \sqrt{5},
\]
\[
a_4 = a_3 + a_2 = (3 + \sqrt{5}) + \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{6 + 2\sqrt{5} + 5 + \sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{11 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2},
\]
\[
a_5 = a_4 + a_3 = \frac{11 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} + (3 + \sqrt{5}) = \frac{11 + 3\sqrt{5} + 6 + 2\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{17 + 5\sqrt{5}}{2},
\]
\[
a_6 = a_5 + a_4 = \frac{17 + 5\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{11 + 3\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{28 + 8\sqrt{5}}{2} = 14 + 4\sqrt{5},
\]
\[
a_7 = a_6 + a_5 = (14 + 4\sqrt{5}) + \frac{17 + 5\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{28 + 8\sqrt{5} + 17 + 5\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{45 + 13\sqrt{5}}{2},
\]
\[
a_8 = a_7 + a_6 = \frac{45 + 13\sqrt{5}}{2} + (14 + 4\sqrt{5}) = \frac{45 + 13\sqrt{5} + 28 + 8\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{73 + 21\sqrt{5}}{2},
\]
\[
a_9 = a_8 + a_7 = \frac{73 + 21\sqrt{5}}{2} + \frac{45 + 13\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{118 + 34\sqrt{5}}{2} = 59 + 17\sqrt{5},
\]
\[
a_{10} = a_9 + a_8 = (59 + 17\sqrt{5}) + \frac{73 + 21\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{118 + 34\sqrt{5} + 73 + 21\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{191 + 55\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

We observe that the sequence \( a_n \) modulo 2 is periodic with a period of 12. Therefore, \( a_{85} = a_{85 \mod 12} = a_{11} \). We can compute \( a_{11} \) as follows:
\[
a_{11} = a_{10} + a_9 = \frac{191 + 55\sqrt{5}}{2} + (59 + 17\sqrt{5}) = \frac{191 + 55\sqrt{5} + 118 + 34\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{309 + 89\sqrt{5}}{2}.
\]

However, we need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) in terms of the golden ratio properties. Since \( z \) is a root of the equation \( z^2 = z + 1 \), we can use the fact that \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is a linear combination of \( \phi \) and \( \frac{1}{\phi} \). By the properties of the golden ratio, we know that \( \phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} \) is an integer. By computation or using the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, we find that \( \phi^{85} + \frac{1}{\phi^{85}} = 2 \times 146 \times 146 = 2 \times 21346 = 42692 \).

Therefore, the value of \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"Given that \(G\) is the centroid of \(\triangle ABC\), and \(G\) is also the centroid of \(\triangle DEF\), we need to find the ratio of the area of \(\triangle ABC\) to the area of \(\triangle ABC\) itself, given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144.

First, recall that the centroid of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. The centroid also divides the triangle into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is three times the area of any of these smaller triangles.

Since \(G\) is the centroid of both \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle DEF\), the area of \(\triangle DEF\) is one-third of the area of \(\triangle ABC\). This is because the centroid of a triangle divides it into three triangles of equal area, and since \(G\) is the centroid of \(\triangle DEF\) as well, the area of \(\triangle DEF\) is one-third of the area of \(\triangle ABC\).

Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle DEF\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money Jef understanding has after performing the given transactions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   Jef initially has $200.

2. **First Transaction:**
   Jef receives $500 from his friend.
   \[
   200 + 500 = 700
   \]
   So, after the first transaction, Jef has $700.

3. **Second Transaction:**
   Jef gives $500 to his friend.
   \[
   700 - 500 = 200

   So, after the second transaction, Jef has $200.

4. **Third Transaction:**
   Jef receives $500 from his friend.

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\), we start by expressing the numerator and the denominator in their prime factorized forms. The numerator is already in its prime factorized form, which is \(21 = 3 \cdot 7\). The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\).

The expression can be rewritten as:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{3 \cdot 7}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}
\]

Since there are no common factors between the numerator and the denominator, the expression is already in its simplest form. Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:
\[

"1. **Identify the given information:**
   - 100 Rs. coins
   - 150 Rs. 5 coins
   - 200 Rs. 2 coins

2. **Calculate the total value of each type of coin:**
   - Value of 100 Rs. coins: \( 100 \times 10 = 1000 \) Rs.
   - Value of 150 Rs. 5 coins: \( 150 \times 5 = 750 \) Rs.
   - Value of 200 Rs. 2 coins: \( 200 \times 2 = 400 \) Rs.

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( n \) such that the number of divisors of \( n^2 \) is \( 2^{24} \). Let's denote \( n \) by its prime factorization: \( n = p_1^{e_1} p_2^{e_2} \cdots p_k^{e_k} \). Then, the prime factorization of \( n^2 \) is \( n^2 = p_1^{2e_1} p_2^{2e_2} \cdots p_k^{2e_k} \).

The number of divisors of a number is given by the product of one plus each of the exponents in its prime factorization. Therefore, the number of divisors of \( n^2 \) is:
\[
(2e_1 + 1)(2e_2 + 1) \cdots (2e_k + 1) = 2^{24}
\]
Since \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, each term \( 2e_i + 1 \) must also be a power of 2. However, the only power of 2 that is odd is 1, so each \( 2e_i + 1 \) must be 1. This implies that each \( e_i \) must be 0, but this would mean \( n = 1 \), which contradicts the condition \( n > 1 \). Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that some of the terms are 3 (the next smallest odd number that can be written as \( 2e_i + 1 \) for some integer \( e_i \)).

Let's assume that \( n \) has \( k \) distinct prime factors, and each \( 2e_i + 1 \) is either 3 or a power of 2. Since the product of these terms is \( 2^{24} \), the only way to achieve this is if all terms are 3 (because the product of any other combination of powers of 2 and 3 would not be a power of 2). Therefore, we have:
\[
2e_i + 1 = 3 \implies e_i = 1
\]
for all \( i \). This means that \( n \) must be the product of \( k \) distinct primes, each raised to the power of 1. The number of divisors of \( n^2 \) is then:
\[
(2 \cdot 1 + 1)(2 \cdot 1 + 1) \cdots (2 \cdot 1 + 1) = 3^k = 2^{24}
\]
Since \( 3^k \) cannot be a power of 2, we need to reconsider our assumption. The correct approach is to recognize that the only way to get a power of 2 from the product of terms of the form \( 2e_i + 1 \) is if all terms are 3. Therefore, we need to find the correct \( k \) such that:
\[
3^k = 2^{24}

This is not possible directly, so we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to recognize that the only way to get a power of 2 from the product of terms of the form \( 2e_i + 1 \) is if all terms are 3. Therefore, we need to find the correct \( k \) such that:

2. 我们需要将分子和分母都表示为2和5的幂。首先，我们分解4321：
   \[

   因此，
   \[
   4321 = 5 \cdot (2^5 \cdot 27) + 1 = 5^1 \cdot 2^5 \cdot 27 + 1

3. 现在，我们将4321表示为2和5的幂：
   \[
   4321 = 5^1 \cdot 2^5 \cdot 27 + 1

4. 接下来，我们将表达式重写为：
   \[
   \frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8} = \frac{5^1 \cdot 2^5 \cdot 27 + 1}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}

7. 将分子和分母都乘以160以清除分数：
   \[

This identity tells us that \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), \(\sin 120^\circ = \sin 60^\circ\), \(\sin 140^\circ = \sin 40^\circ\), and \(\sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ
\]

We can group the terms as follows:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 20^\circ) (\sin 40^\circ \sin 40^\circ) (\sin 60^\circ \sin 60^\circ) (\sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ)
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) (\sin^2 60^\circ) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \(\sin^2 60^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin^2 20^\circ) (\sin^2 40^\circ) \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) (\sin^2 80^\circ)
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin x = \cos (90^\circ - x)\) to express \(\sin 80^\circ\) as \(\cos 10^\circ\). However, we can use another approach by considering the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. The product of sines of angles in the form \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\) for \(x = 20^\circ\). This gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Since \(\sin 80^\circ = \cos 10^\circ\) and \(\sin 100^\circ = \sin 80^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}

First, recall that the magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]
where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). Substituting the given magnitudes, we get:

\]
The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) is:

\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

First, we substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

We will expand each term separately.

1. Expand \( (x + 5)^3 \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 5^2 + 5^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125

2. Expand \( -49(x + 5)^2 \):

\[
-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot 5 + 5^2) = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225

3. Expand \( 623(x + 5) \):

\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115

Now, combine all the expanded terms:

\[

Combine like terms:

\[

Thus, the function \( g(x) \) is:

To find \( g(0) \):

\[

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties. Let's break it down step by step.

First, recall the identity for the secant function:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = \frac{1}{\cos^2 \theta}
\]
Thus, we can rewrite the given expression as:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean identity for secant and tangent:
\[
\sec^2 \theta = 1 + \tan^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity to \(\sec^2 10^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ
\]

Similarly, for \(\csc^2 20^\circ\) and \(\csc^2 40^\circ\), we use the identity for cosecant:
\[
\csc^2 \theta = 1 + \cot^2 \theta
\]
Applying this identity, we get:
\[
\csc^2 20^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ
\]
\[
\csc^2 40^\circ = 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Now, substitute these back into the original expression:
\[
\sec^2 10^\circ + \csc^2 20^\circ + \csc^2 40^\circ = (1 + \tan^2 10^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 20^\circ) + (1 + \cot^2 40^\circ)
\]

Combine the constants:
\[
= 1 + 1 + 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]
\[
= 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ
\]

Next, we use the identity for cotangent in terms of tangent:
\[
\cot \theta = \frac{1}{\tan \theta}
\]
Thus:
\[
\cot^2 20^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}
\]
\[
\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

Substitute these into the expression:
\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}
\]

We need to find a way to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\). Notice that:
\[
\tan 20^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 10^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]
\[
\tan 40^\circ = \tan (30^\circ + 10^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ + \tan 10^\circ}{1 - \tan 30^\circ \tan 10^\circ}
\]

However, these identities are complex to handle directly. Instead, we use a known result from trigonometric identities:
\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ} = 12

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

"1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \(1070^\circ\) in terms of a full circle (360 degrees) and a remaining angle.

2. **Setting Up the Division:**
   We start by dividing \(1070^\circ\) by \(360^\circ\) to find out how many full circles fit into \(1070^\circ\).

   \[
   1070 \div 360
   \]

3. **Performing the Division:**
   \[
   1070 \div 360 \approx 2.9722

4. **Finding the Integer Part:**
   The integer part of the division result is 2, which means there are 2 full circles in \(1070^\circ\).

5. **Calculating the Remaining Angle:**
   To find the remaining angle, we multiply the integer part by \(360^\circ\) and subtract this from \(1070^\circ\).

   \[
   1070^\circ - (2 \times 360^\circ)

"Given the problem, we need to find the value of \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \).

First, let's interpret the congruence condition \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \). This means that when \( t + 2 \) is divided by 23, the remainder is the same as when \( t \) is divided by 23. Mathematically, this can be written as:
\[ t + 2 = t + 23k \]
for some integer \( k \). Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ 2 = 23k \]
Since 23 is a prime number and does not divide 2, the only integer solution for \( k \) is \( k = 0 \). However, this would imply \( 2 = 0 \), which is not possible. Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that the congruence condition is satisfied in a different way.

Instead, let's re-evaluate the problem. The condition \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \) implies that \( t + 2 \) and \( t \) differ by a multiple of 23. This can only happen if \( t + 2 = t + 23k \) for some integer \( k \), but since \( t \) and \( t + 2 \) are consecutive integers, the only way this can happen is if \( k = 0 \), which is not possible as we saw before. However, we can also consider the possibility that \( t + 2 \) and \( t \) are congruent modulo 23 in a different way.

Let's try to find a value of \( t \) such that \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \) is satisfied. We can test values of \( t \) from 1 to 22 to see if any of them satisfy the condition. However, we can also use the fact that \( t + 2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \) implies that \( t + 2 - t = 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), which is not possible unless \( t \) is such that \( t + 2 \) is a multiple of 23. The only way this can happen is if \( t = 21 \), because \( 21 + 2 = 23 \), which is a multiple of 23.

Therefore, the value of \( t \) that satisfies the condition is:
\[ t = 21 \]

Next, we know that \(\cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2} - \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Let \(\phi = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\). Then \(\tan(\phi) = \frac{1}{x}\) and \(\phi\) is in the range \(-\frac{\pi}{2} < \phi < \frac{\pi}{2}\).

Now, we need to find the sum \(\theta + \phi\):

Since the denominator is zero, \(\tan(\theta + \phi)\) is undefined, which means \(\theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2}\) (because the tangent function is undefined at \(\frac{\pi}{2}\)).

The direction vector of the first line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

We observe that:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
This means that the direction vector of the second line is indeed a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line, specifically, it is 2 times the direction vector of the first line. Therefore, the two lines are parallel.

Next, we need to check if the lines are coincident. For the lines to be coincident, there must exist values of \(t\) and \(u\) such that:

3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \\
-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \\
1 - 2t = 6 - 4u

We can simplify each equation:
1. \(3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \implies 2t - 4u = -8 \implies t - 2u = -4\)
2. \(-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \implies -9t + 18u = 7 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{7}{9}\)
3. \(1 - 2t = 6 - 4u \implies -2t + 4u = 5 \implies -t + 2u = \frac{5}{2}\)

From the first equation, we have \(t - 2u = -4\). From the second equation, we have \(-t + 2u = \frac{7}{9}\). Adding these two equations, we get:
\[
(t - 2u) + (-t + 2u) = -4 + \frac{7}{9} \implies 0 = -4 + \frac{7}{9} \implies 0 = -\frac{36}{9} + \frac{7}{9} \implies 0 = -\frac{29}{9},

"Given the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to determine the equation of the hyperbola that passes through these points. The general form of a hyperbola centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} - \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

We need to find the values of \(a\) and \(b\). The points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) are on the hyperbola, and the points \((5,-4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) are also on the hyperbola. Let's substitute the point \((5,4)\) into the equation:

\[
\frac{5^2}{a^2} - \frac{4^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{25}{a^2} - \frac{16}{b^2} = 1
\]

Similarly, substituting the point \((5,-4)\) into the equation gives the same result because the equation is symmetric with respect to \(y\):

\[
\frac{25}{a^2} - \frac{16}{b^2} = 1
\]

Now, we need another equation to solve for \(a\) and \(b\). Notice that the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\) are horizontally aligned, and the points \((5,-4)\) and \((-5,-4)\) are also horizontally aligned. This symmetry suggests that the hyperbola is indeed centered at the origin with a horizontal transverse axis.

To find \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the fact that the distance from the center to each vertex (which is \(a\)) and the distance from the center to each co-vertex (which is \(b\)) are related to the points given. The distance from the center to each vertex is 5, so \(a = 5\). The distance from the center to each co-vertex is 4, so \(b = 4\).

Thus, the equation of the hyperbola is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{5^2} - \frac{y^2}{4^2} = 1
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\frac{x^2}{25} - \frac{y^2}{16} = 1

Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we will use the distributive property of the cross product. The expression can be expanded as follows:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} - \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}
\]

We are given the following cross products:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the cross product is anti-commutative, \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} + 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} - 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications and then add the resulting vectors:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[

\]
\[

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a quadrilateral with \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AB = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(DA = d\)

Since \(AB \parallel CD\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), quadrilateral \(ABCD\) can be divided into two right triangles, \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ACB\), with \(\overline{AC}\) as the common height.

The area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ACB\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACB]
\]
Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACB] = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as the height. Let's denote the length of \(\overline{AC}\) as \(h\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

Similarly, \(\triangle ACB\) is a right triangle with \(\overline{AC}\) as the height. The area of \(\triangle ACB\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACB] = \frac{1}{2} \times AB \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

Adding these two areas together, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACB] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times (a + c)
\]

Since we know that \([ABCD] = 42\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times h \times (a + c) = 42
\]

To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we need to isolate \([\triangle ACD]\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

From the equation \(\frac{1}{2} \times h \times (a + c) = 42\), we can solve for \(h \times (a + c)\):
\[
h \times (a + c) = 84
\]

Since \([\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h\), we can express \(h\) in terms of \(c\) and the total area:
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + c}
\]

Substituting \(h\) back into the area formula for \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times \frac{84}{a + c} = \frac{42c}{a + c}
\]

However, we need to find a simpler expression. Notice that the total area of the quadrilateral is the sum of the areas of the two right triangles, and since the height \(h\) is common, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the total area of the quadrilateral:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

The operation is defined as:
\[

Here, we have:

Substituting \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation definition, we get:

"Given the problem, we need to determine the relationship between the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) based on the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).
   - The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) are mentioned.
   - The problem states that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are� next to each other.

2. **Interpreting the Condition:**
   - When we say \(AB\) is� next to \(CD\), it implies that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are adjacent segments.
   - This means that the endpoints of \(AB\) and \(CD\) are such that \(B\) and \(C\) are consecutive points.

3. **Visualizing the Configuration:**
   - Let's place the points on a line for simplicity.
   - Assume \(A\) is at the leftmost position.
   - \(B\) is the next point to the right of \(A\).
   - \(C\) is the next point to the right of \(B\).
   - \(D\) is the next point to the right of \(C\).

4. **Determining the Relationship:**
   - Since \(B\) and \(C\) are consecutive points, the segment \(AB\) ends at \(B\) and the segment \(CD\) starts at \(C\).
   - Therefore, the segment \(AB\) and the segment \(CD\) are adjacent and share the point \(B\) and \(C\) respectively.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The relationship between \(AB\) and \(CD\) is that they are adjacent segments.

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we will use trigonometric identities and properties of the inverse sine function. Let's denote \(\arcsin 0.4\) by \(\alpha\) and \(\arcsin 0.5\) by \(\beta\). Therefore, we have \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\).

First, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\), we have \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{84}}{10} = \frac{2\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Similarly, since \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\), we have \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{75}}{10} = \frac{5\sqrt{3}}{10} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Now, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10}.

\[

3. The total number of women is twice the total number of men.

We can express these conditions as equations:

\[ C = 24 \]
\[ W = 2M \]

First, substitute the value of \( C \) into the first equation:

8. **Verify the solutions by substituting them back into the original equation:**

   For \(x = 66\):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16

   This solution is incorrect.

   For \(x = -62\):
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} \neq 16
   \]
   This solution is also incorrect.

Since both solutions do not satisfy the original equation, there are no real solutions to the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \), and \( AD = 10 \) with \( \angle BDC = 3 \angle BAC \), we need to find the length of \( BC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \), \( BM = MC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \), so \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \), \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

Now, consider \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \). Since \( D \) lies on \( BC \), \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and \( \angle BDA = 180^\circ - 3\theta \). Also, \( \angle BAD = \angle CAD = \frac{\theta}{2} \).

Using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{AD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{10}{\sin \left( 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{10}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
So,
\[
BD = 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

Similarly, using the Law of Sines in \( \triangle ACD \):
\[
\frac{CD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{AD}{\sin \left( \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} \right)} = \frac{10}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
So,
\[
CD = 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

Since \( BD = CD \) and \( BD + CD = BC = 2x \), we have:
\[
2 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} = 2x \implies x = 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

Now, we use the fact that \( AM = 11 \) and \( AD = 10 \). In \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \), we can use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABD \) and \( \triangle ACD \) to find \( AB \) and \( AC \).

Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABD \):
\[
AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 - 2 \cdot AD \cdot BD \cdot \cos \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
\[
AB^2 = 10^2 + \left( 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} \right)^2 - 2 \cdot 10 \cdot 10 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} \cdot \cos \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
\[
AB^2 = 100 + 100 \cdot \frac{\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos^2 \frac{3\theta}{2}} - 200 \cdot \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

AB^2 = 100 + 100 \cdot \frac{\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos^2 \frac{3\theta}{2}} - 100 \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]

Since \( AB = AC \), we can use the fact that \( \angle BAC = \theta \) and the properties of the isosceles triangle to find that \( BC = 24 \).

"Given the equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Since \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\), we have:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Next, we use the square of the sum of the variables:
\[
(x+y+z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = s(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]
We also know from the second given equation that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
xy(x+y) + yz(y+z) + zx(z+x) = 12.
\]
Using \(s = x+y+z\), we can express this as:
\[
xy(s-z) + yz(s-x) + zx(s-y) = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
s(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz = 12.
\]
Substituting \(xyz = 4\) and \(xy + yz + zx = p\), we get:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
From \(sp = 24\), we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\), we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}) = s^3 - 72.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
s^3 = 64,

so:
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)} < 0\]

The expression \(\frac{|(x-9)(x+9)|}{x(x-36)}\) will be negative when the numerator and the denominator have opposite signs. The numerator \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is always non-negative (it is zero when \(x = 9\) or \(x = -9\)), so the fraction will be negative when the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative.

We need to manipulate our equation to match this form. Notice that if we let \( y = \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we can rearrange it to:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3.
   \]
   Since \( x = 3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 0, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = -1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = 3 \), we get:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 12}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{16}}{-2} = \frac{-2 \pm 4}{-2}.
   \]
   This gives us \( x = \frac{2}{-2} = -1 \) or \( x = \frac{-6}{-2} = 3 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid.

Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 0 \) is \( x = 3 \), so \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

1. For \( x \leq 3 \), \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3.
   \]
   Since \( x = -3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), it is a valid solution.

2. For \( x > 3 \), \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting this equal to 6, we get:
   \[
   -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6.
   \]
   This is a cubic equation, and solving it analytically is complex. However, we can check if there are any simple solutions. Testing \( x = 2 \):
   \[
   -2^3 + 2 \cdot 2^2 + 3 \cdot 2 = -8 + 8 + 6 = 6.
   \]
   So, \( x = 2 \) is a solution, but it is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Therefore, there are no valid solutions in this domain.

Therefore, the only solution to \( f(x) = 6 \) is \( x = -3 \), so \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the solutions:
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0.

"Given the problem, we need to determine the coordinates of point \( P \) in a 3-dimensional space. The problem states that \( P \) is equidistant from the points \( A(1,0,0) \), \( B(-1,0,0) \), \( C(0,1,0) \), \( D(0,-1,0) \), \( E(0,0,1) \), and \( F(0,0,-1) \). Additionally, \( P \) is also equidistant from the points \( G(1,1,1) \), \( H(1,1,-1) \), \( I(1,-1,1) \), and \( J(-1,1,1) \).

First, let's find the coordinates of \( P \) by using the fact that \( P \) is equidistant from \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), \( D \), \( E \), and \( F \). The distance from \( P(x, y, z) \) to any of these points is the same. Let's calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( A \) and \( B \):

\[
PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]

Since \( PA = PB \), we have:

\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2
\]
\[
(x-1)^2 = (x+1)^2
\]
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 = x^2 + 2x + 1
\]
\[
-2x = 2x
\]
\[
x = 0
\]

So, the \( x \)-coordinate of \( P \) is 0. Now, let's calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( C \) and \( D \):

\[
PC = \sqrt{y^2 + (z-1)^2}
\]
\[
PD = \sqrt{y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

Since \( PC = PD \), we have:

\[
y^2 + (z-1)^2 = y^2 + (z+1)^2
\]
\[
(z-1)^2 = (z+1)^2
\]
\[
z^2 - 2z + 1 = z^2 + 2z + 1
\]
\[
-2z = 2z
\]
\[
z = 0
\]

So, the \( z \)-coordinate of \( P \) is 0. Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (0, y, 0) \). Now, let's use the fact that \( P \) is equidistant from \( G \), \( H \), \( I \), and \( J \). Let's calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( G \):

\[
PG = \sqrt{0^2 + (y-1)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{(y-1)^2 + 1}
\]

Now, let's calculate the distance from \( P \) to \( H \):

\[
PH = \sqrt{0^2 + (y-1)^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{(y-1)^2 + 1}
\]

Since \( PG = PH \), we have:

\[
\sqrt{(y-1)^2 + 1} = \sqrt{(y+1)^2 + 1}
\]
\[
(y-1)^2 + 1 = (y+1)^2 + 1
\]
\[
(y-1)^2 = (y+1)^2
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 1 = y^2 + 2y + 1
\]
\[
-2y = 2y
\]
\[
y = 0
\]

So, the \( y \)-coordinate of \( P \) is 0. Therefore, the coordinates of \( P \) are \( (0, 0, 0) \).

The coordinates of \( P \) are \(\boxed{(0,0,0)}\).","[(0, 0, 0), '(0,0,0)']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"Given the problem, we need to determine the amount of gold in the final mixture of two mixtures. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Mixture:**
   - 1000 g of gold
   - 1000 g of silver
   - Total weight of the first mixture = 1000 g + 1000 g = 2000 g

2. **Second Mixture:**
   - 1500 g of gold
   - 500 g of silver
   - Total weight of the second mixture = 1500 g + 500 g = 2000 g

3. **Combining the Two Mixture:**
   - Total weight of the combined mixture = 2000 g + 2000 g = 4000 g
   - Total weight of gold in the combined mixture = 1000 g + 1500 g = 2500 g
   - Total weight of silver in the combined mixture = 1000 g + 500 g = 1500 g

4. **Finding the Ratio of Gold to Silver in the Combined Mixture:**
   - The ratio of gold to silver in the combined mixture is 2500 g : 1500 g.
   - Simplifying the ratio, we get 2500/1500 = 5/3.
   - Therefore, the ratio of gold to silver in the combined mixture is 5:3.

5. **Finding the Amount of Gold in the Final Mixture:**
   - The final mixture is 2000 g.
   - Let the amount of gold in the final mixture be \(5x\) and the amount of silver be \(3x\).
   - The total weight of the final mixture is \(5x + 3x = 8x\).
   - Given that the total weight of the final mixture is 2000 g, we have \(8x = 2000\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get \(x = 2000 / 8 = 250\).
   - Therefore, the amount of gold in the final mixture is \(5x = 5 \times 250 = 1250\) g.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the polynomial \( g(x) \) which is the polynomial \( f(x-1) \) and then determine the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \).

First, let's find the polynomial \( f(x-1) \). We start with the given polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). To find \( f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[
f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2
\]

Next, we need to expand each term. Let's start with \( (x-1)^4 \):

\[
(x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1
\]

So,

\[
3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3
\]

Now, let's expand \( (x-1)^2 \):

\[
(x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1
\]

So,

\[
5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5
\]

And,

\[
-9(x-1) = -9x + 9
\]

Putting it all together, we get:

\[
f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
f(x-1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
\]

So, the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x-1) \) is:

\[
g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15
\]

The sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is found by evaluating the polynomial at \( x = 1 \). Therefore, we need to evaluate \( g(1) \):

\[
g(1) = 3(1)^4 - 12(1)^3 + 23(1)^2 - 31(1) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15 = 2
\]

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"Given the point \((6, 0)\) and the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we need to find the equation of the line that passes through the point \((6, 0)\) and is perpendicular to the line \(y = 2x - 2\).

First, we determine the slope of the given line \(y = 2x - 2\). The slope of this line is 2. Since the line we are looking for is perpendicular to this line, its slope will be the negative reciprocal of 2. The negative reciprocal of 2 is \(-\frac{1}{2}\).

Now, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line, which is given by:
\[ y - y_1 = m(x - x_1) \]
where \((x_1, y_1)\) is a point on the line and \(m\) is the slope of the line. Substituting the point \((6, 0)\) and the slope \(-\frac{1}{2}\) into the point-slope form, we get:
\[ y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6) \]
Simplifying this, we get:
\[ y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3 \]

Therefore, the equation of the line that passes through the point \((6, 0)\) and is perpendicular to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"Given the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the values of the expressions \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sums and products of the roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. We know that:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
From Vieta's formulas, we have:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
Let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\). Then \(a + b = -2\) and \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = 0\). This can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + ab = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + (-2)a = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2a.
\]
Thus, \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab = (-2)a = -2a\).

Next, we use the identity for the product of the roots taken three at a time:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2b + \alpha_3\alpha_4a = 0 \implies \alpha_1\alpha_2b = -\alpha_3\alpha_4a.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2a\), we have \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = 2a - \alpha_3\alpha_4\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
(2a - \alpha_3\alpha_4)b = -\alpha_3\alpha_4a \implies 2ab - \alpha_3\alpha_4b = -\alpha_3\alpha_4a \implies 2ab = \alpha_3\alpha_4(b - a).
\]
Since \(a + b = -2\), we have \(b = -2 - a\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
2a(-2 - a) = \alpha_3\alpha_4(-2 - a - a) \implies -4a - 2a^2 = \alpha_3\alpha_4(-2 - 2a) \implies -4a - 2a^2 = -2\alpha_3\alpha_4(1 + a).
\]
Since \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2 - \alpha_1\alpha_2\), we have:
\[
-4a - 2a^2 = -2(2 - \alpha_1\alpha_2)(1 + a) \implies -4a - 2a^2 = -2(2 - (2a - \alpha_3\alpha_4))(1 + a) \implies -4a - 2a^2 = -2(2 - 2a + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(1 + a).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
-4a - 2a^2 = -2(2 - 2a + 2 - \alpha_1\alpha_2)(1 + a) \implies -4a - 2a^2 = -2(4 - 2a - \alpha_1\alpha_2)(1 + a).
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2a.
\]
Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2a\) and \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2a\), we have:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = -2a.

2. **Perform the Division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. This can be done using long division or a calculator.

   - Using long division:
     - 500 goes into 137 zero times, so we write 0 before the decimal point.
     - We then consider 1370 (by adding a decimal point and a zero).
     - 500 goes into 1370 two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)).
     - Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
     - Bring down another zero to make it 3700.
     - 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)).
     - Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
     - Bring down another zero to make it 2000.
     - 500 goes into 2000 four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)).
     - Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0.

   - Therefore, the division gives us \(0.274\).

3. **Write the Final Answer**: The decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

So, the final answer is \(\boxed{0.274}\).","[0.274000000000000, '0.274']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"Given a quadrilateral \(ABCD\) with \(O\) as the center of symmetry, and the ratio \(AB/AD = k\), we need to find the relationship between the sides of the quadrilateral and the symmetry properties.

Since \(O\) is the center of symmetry, the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is symmetric with respect to point \(O\). This means that the diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\) intersect at \(O\) and bisect each other. Therefore, \(O\) is the midpoint of both diagonals \(AC\) and \(BD\).

Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we need to find the relationship between the sides of the quadrilateral and the symmetry properties. Since \(O\) is the center of symmetry, the quadrilateral can be divided into four congruent triangles by its diagonals. This means that the sides of the quadrilateral are related in such a way that the ratio of the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) is preserved under the symmetry transformation.

The symmetry of the quadrilateral implies that the sides \(AB\) and \(AD\) are related by the factor \(k\), and the same relationship holds for the other pairs of opposite sides. Therefore, the relationship between the sides of the quadrilateral is given by the symmetry properties and the given ratio.

"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) at the given points and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{if } n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f \) at each of the given points step by step.

1. Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \). We know that \( \pi \approx 3.14159 \), so \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.0472 \).
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the function definition: \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil \).
   - The ceiling of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \), which is 2.
   - Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = 2 \).

2. Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \). We know that \( \sqrt{45} \approx 6.708 \).
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of \( \sqrt{45} \) is the largest integer less than or equal to \( \sqrt{45} \), which is 6.
   - Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = 6 \).

3. Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
   - First, we need to determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \). We know that \( 8 = 2^3 \), so \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the function definition: \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor \).
   - The floor of 4 is 4.
   - Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the function evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money the man has after all the transactions and then find out how much he has after the final transactions.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money the man has after each transaction:

1. The man starts with $27.47.
2. He then receives $35.23, so his new total is:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
3. He then receives $37.37, so his new total is:
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
4. He then receives $26.52, so his new total is:
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

Now, we need to determine how much money he has after the final transactions. The problem states that he has to give away some money and receive some money, but it does not specify the exact amounts. However, the problem also mentions that he has to give away some money and receive some money, but it does not specify the exact amounts. Since the problem does not provide specific amounts for these transactions, we can assume that the final amount is the same as the total amount he had after all the initial transactions, which is $126.59.

Therefore, the amount of money the man has after all the transactions is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of sons and daughters in the family based on the given information. Let's denote the number of sons by \( S \) and the number of daughters by \( D \).

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. If 20 sons are removed, the number of sons is equal to the number of daughters.
2. If 80 sons are removed, the number of sons is equal to 90% of the number of daughters.
3. If 2 sons are removed, the number of sons is equal to 100% of the number of daughters.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( S - 20 = D \)
2. \( S - 80 = 0.9D \)
3. \( S - 2 = D \)

We can see that equations 1 and 3 are the same, so we only need to use two of them. Let's use equations 1 and 2.

From equation 1, we can express \( S \) in terms of \( D \):
\[ S = D + 20 \]

Now substitute \( S = D + 20 \) into equation 2:
\[ (D + 20) - 80 = 0.9D \]
\[ D + 20 - 80 = 0.9D \]
\[ D - 60 = 0.9D \]
\[ D - 0.9D = 60 \]
\[ 0.1D = 60 \]
\[ D = 600 \]

Now substitute \( D = 600 \) back into equation 1 to find \( S \):
\[ S = 600 + 20 \]
\[ S = 620 \]

So, the number of sons is 620 and the number of daughters is 600. The total number of children is:
\[ S + D = 620 + 600 = 1220 \]

Therefore, the number of sons and daughters in the family is \(\boxed{1220}\).","[1220, '1220']",84,"[84, '84']",False
"To solve for \( n \) in the given grid, we need to analyze the relationships between the numbers in the grid. The grid is structured as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
n-3 & 3 & n+1 \\
\hline
n+2 & 2n-9 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & n & n-1 \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

We need to find the value of \( n \) such that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same. This is a property of a magic square.

First, let's calculate the sum of the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the sum of the second row equal to the sum of the first and third rows:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6
\]
\[
n = 7
\]

Now, let's verify that \( n = 7 \) satisfies the conditions for the columns and diagonals.

The sum of the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = 7-3 + 7+2 + 2 = 15
\]

The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The sum of the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = 7+1 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = 7-3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 6 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = 7+1 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The cube roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as \((x-1)(x^2 + x + 1) = 0\). Therefore, the roots are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\) where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) are the non-real cube roots of unity. These roots satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}

Since \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we have \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 1 - 1 + 1 = 1
