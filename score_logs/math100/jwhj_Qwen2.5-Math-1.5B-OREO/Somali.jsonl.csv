"We can write

&= \sqrt{1 - y^2} \cdot \sqrt{x^2} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} \cdot \sqrt{y^2} \\
&= \sqrt{x^2 (1 - y^2)} + \sqrt{y^2 (1 - x^2)} \\
&= \sqrt{x^2 - x^2 y^2} + \sqrt{y^2 - x^2 y^2} \\
&= \sqrt{x^2} \sqrt{1 - y^2} + \sqrt{y^2} \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
&= |x| \sqrt{1 - y^2} + |y| \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\end{align*}If $x$ and $y$ have the same sign, then $f(x,y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} = f(y,x).$  Otherwise, $f(x,y) = -f(y,x).$  Thus, $f(x,y)$ is an odd function of $x$ and $y.$

If $x = y,$ then
\[f(x,x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}.\]If $x = -y,$ then
\[f(x,-x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0.\]If $x \neq \pm y,$ then
\begin{align*}
f(x,y) + f(y,x) &= x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - y^2} \\
&= 2x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + 2y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \\
&= 2(x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2}).
\end{align*}Thus, $f(x,y) + f(y,x) = 0,$ so $f(x,y) = -f(y,x).$  Therefore, $f(x,y)$ is an odd function of $x$ and $y.$

If $x = 0,$ then
\[f(0,y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y.\]If $y = 0,$ then
\[f(x,0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x.\]Thus, $f(x,y)$ is linear in $x$ and $y.$  Therefore, $f(x,y)$ is a linear function of $x$ and $y.$

Since $f(x,y)$ is linear, odd, and defined on a closed and bounded region, it must achieve its maximum and minimum values on the boundary of the region.  The boundary of the region consists of the lines $x = -1,$ $x = 1,$ $y = -1,$ and $y = 1.$

If $x = -1,$ then
\[f(-1,y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}.\]If $x = 1,$ then
\[f(1,y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2}.\]If $y = -1,$ then
\[f(x,-1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} - 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}.\]If $y = 1,$ then
\[f(x,1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}.\]Thus, the maximum value of $f(x,y)$ is $\sqrt{1 - x^2} + \sqrt{1 - y^2},$ which occurs at $(x,y) = (1,1).$  The minimum value of $f(x,y)$ is $-\sqrt{1 - x^2} - \sqrt{1 - y^2},$ which occurs at $(x,y) = (-1,-1).$

"Let $O$ be the center of the circle. Since $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel chords, $O$ is the midpoint of the perpendicular bisector of $AB$ and $CD$. Let $M$ and $N$ be the midpoints of $AB$ and $CD$, respectively. Then $OM$ and $ON$ are perpendicular to $AB$ and $CD$, respectively, and $OM = ON$. Since $AB$ and $CD$ are parallel, $OM$ and $ON$ are parallel. Therefore, $OMN$ is an isosceles triangle with $OM = ON$. Let $P$ be the midpoint of $MN$. Then $OP$ is perpendicular to $MN$ and bisects $MN$. Therefore, $OP$ is the perpendicular bisector of $MN$. Since $OMN$ is an isosceles triangle, $OP$ is also the angle bisector of $\angle MON$. Therefore, $OP$ bisects $\angle MON$. Since $OMN$ is an isosceles triangle, $\angle MON = 180^\circ - 2\angle MNO$. Therefore, $\angle MNO = \frac{1}{2}\angle MON$. Since $OP$ bisects $\angle MON$, $\angle MOP = \frac{1}{2}\angle MON$. Therefore, $\angle MOP = \angle MNO$. Therefore, $\triangle MOP$ and $\triangle MNO$ are similar. Therefore, $\frac{MP}{MO} = \frac{MO}{MN}$. Since $M$ is the midpoint of $AB$, $MP = \frac{1}{2}AB$. Since $N$ is the midpoint of $CD$, $MN = \frac{1}{2}(CD)$. Therefore, $\frac{\frac{1}{2}AB}{MO} = \frac{MO}{\frac{1}{2}(CD)}$. Therefore, $MO^2 = \frac{1}{4}AB \cdot CD$. Therefore, $MO = \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}AB \cdot CD} = \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{AB \cdot CD}$. Therefore, $MN = 2MO = \sqrt{AB \cdot CD}$. Therefore, $AB \cdot CD = MN^2$. Therefore, $AB \cdot CD = (MN)^2 = (2MP)^2 = 4MP^2$. Therefore, $AB \cdot CD = 4MP^2 = 4\left(\frac{1}{2}AB\right)^2 = AB^2$. Therefore, $AB = CD$. Therefore, $AB$ and $CD$ are equal in length. Therefore, $AB$ and $CD$ are equal in length.

Then $\angle ADB = 180^\circ - 3\alpha$ and $\angle ADC = 180^\circ - 3\alpha,$ so $\angle BDA = \angle CDA = \alpha.$  Then by the Law of Sines on triangles $ABD$ and $ACD,$
\[\frac{BD}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ABD} = \frac{11}{\sin 3 \alpha}\]and
\[\frac{CD}{\sin \alpha} = \frac{AD}{\sin \angle ACD} = \frac{11}{\sin 3 \alpha}.\]Hence, $BD = CD.$

The second equation factors as $x(-x^2+2x+3) = 0$, which gives $x = 0$ or $x = -1$ or $x = 3$.  Since $-1$ and $0$ are not greater than $3$, the only solution is $x = 3$.  Therefore, $f^{-1}(0) = 3$.

We now find $f^{-1}(6)$.  If $f(x) = 6$, then either $3-x = 6$ or $-x^3+2x^2+3x = 6$.  The first equation gives $x = -3$, which is not less than or equal to $3$.  The second equation factors as $-x^3+2x^2+3x-6 = 0$, which factors as $-(x-2)(x^2-x+3) = 0$.  The quadratic factor has no real roots, so the only solution is $x = 2$.  Therefore, $f^{-1}(6) = 2$.

Therefore, $f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = \boxed{5}$. ","[5, '5']",0,"[0, '0']",False

"Let $x$ be the number of softball and $y$ be the number of baseball. We have the equations $200x+150y=1000$ and $x+y=10$. Multiplying the second equation by 200, we get $200x+200y=2000$. Subtracting the first equation from this, we get $50y=1000$, so $y=20$. Since $x+y=10$, we have $x=10-20=-10$. However, this is not possible, so we must have made a mistake.

"We can see that the number of days that Fasalka has been working is directly proportional to the number of days that he has been at the kooban.  We can see this by dividing the number of days he has been at the kooban by the number of days he has been working.  For example, $80/20=4$ and $90/8=11.25$.  Since the ratio is not constant, we can see that the number of days that Fasalka has been working is not directly proportional to the number of days that he has been at the kooban.  However, we can see that the number of days that Fasalka has been working is inversely proportional to the number of days that he has been at the kooban.  This is because the product of the number of days that Fasalka has been working and the number of days that he has been at the kooban is always $30$.  Therefore, if Fasalka has been working for $x$ days, then he has been at the kooban for $\frac{30}{x}$ days.  If he has been working for $10$ days, then he has been at the kooban for $\frac{30}{10}=\boxed{3}$ days. ","[3, '3']",84,"[84, '84']",False

"Since $\omega^3 = 1,$ $\omega^3 - 1 = 0,$ so

\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} &= \frac{1 + \omega^2 + 1 + \omega}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} \\

"We can use Heron's formula to find the area of triangle $ABC$. The semiperimeter is $s = \frac{3+6+6}{2} = \frac{15}{2}$, so the area of $ABC$ is $\sqrt{\frac{15}{2}\left(\frac{15}{2}-3\right)\left(\frac{15}{2}-6\right)\left(\frac{15}{2}-6\right)} = \frac{9\sqrt{15}}{2}$. The area of triangle $ABD$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3\cdot 5 = \frac{15}{2}$, so the area of triangle $ACD$ is $\frac{9\sqrt{15}}{2}-\frac{15}{2} = \frac{9\sqrt{15}-15}{2}$. The area of triangle $ACD$ is also $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 4\cdot h$, where $h$ is the altitude from $D$ to $AC$. Thus, $\frac{9\sqrt{15}-15}{2} = 2h$, so $h = \frac{9\sqrt{15}-15}{4}$. The area of triangle $ABC$ is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 6\cdot h = \frac{1}{2}\cdot 6\cdot \frac{9\sqrt{15}-15}{4} = \boxed{\frac{27\sqrt{15}-45}{4}}$.
