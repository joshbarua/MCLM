To explain briefly, when a > 0 the function is defined by

  f(x) = ax + 2a for x < a   (a linear function with range (-∞, 3a))  
  f(x) = ax² for x ≥ a   (a quadratic function with range [a³, ∞))  

For f to intersect every horizontal line, the union of these ranges must cover all real numbers. That requires the gap between 3a and a³ to vanish, i.e. 3a ≥ a³. For a > 0, dividing both sides by a gives 3 ≥ a², so a ≤ √3. Checking the borderline case a = √3 shows the ranges meet at 3√3, ensuring surjectivity. 

Thus, the largest a is \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.","[sqrt(3), '\\sqrt{3}']",2,"[2, '2']",False

To explain briefly, consider the logistic map f(x) = λx(1 - x) on [0,1]. A point x is a period‐2 point (with f(f(x)) = x but f(x) ≠ x) if it is not a fixed point of f but is fixed by f². It is a well-known fact in the study of the logistic map that nontrivial period‐2 orbits appear via a period-doubling bifurcation when λ passes through 3. For 0 ≤ λ ≤ 3 the only solutions of f²(x) = x are those where f(x) = x. When λ > 3 (up to 4, where f maps [0,1] into itself) genuine period‐2 orbits exist.

Consider the following steps: There are initially 24 books in total spread across 3 shelves. The top shelf has 8 mystery books, the middle shelf has 10 math books, and the bottom shelf has 6 science books. When 2 books are removed from each shelf, the books remaining become:

Top shelf: 8 - 2 = 6 mystery books  
Middle shelf: 10 - 2 = 8 math books  
Bottom shelf: 6 - 2 = 4 science books

To explain briefly: Since 450 factors as 2·3²·5², a number divisible by 450 must be even, divisible by 9, and by 25. For a number composed only of 0’s and 1’s to be even and divisible by 25, it must end in ""00"" (making it even and divisible by 25). If you remove these last two zeros, the remaining digits (which are exclusively 1’s) will have a digit sum equal to the number of 1’s. To be divisible by 9, this sum must be a multiple of 9. The smallest such sum is 9 (i.e. nine 1’s), making the full number 11111111100.","[11111111100, '11111111100']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False
"\boxed{\frac{1}{2}} 

We can explain briefly as follows:

1. The spinner has 6 numbers: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 9. When the first spin is taken mod 4, note that:
  • 1 and 9 leave remainder 1,
  • 2 and 6 leave remainder 2,
  • 3 and 7 leave remainder 3.
Thus each column (1, 2, or 3) occurs with probability 2/6 = 1/3.

2. For the second spin, taking the result mod 5:
  • 1 and 6 leave remainder 1,
  • 2 and 7 leave remainder 2,
  • 3 leaves remainder 3,
  • 9 leaves remainder 4.
So the probabilities for rows 1, 2, 3, and 4 are 2/6, 2/6, 1/6, and 1/6 respectively.

3. The checkerboard has 12 squares (3 columns × 4 rows) with 6 shaded squares. A square’s probability is the product of its column probability and row probability.

The shaded squares are in positions:
  (1,1): probability = 1/3 · 2/6 = 1/9,
  (1,3): probability = 1/3 · 1/6 = 1/18,
  (2,2): probability = 1/3 · 2/6 = 1/9,
  (2,4): probability = 1/3 · 1/6 = 1/18,
  (3,1): probability = 1/3 · 2/6 = 1/9,
  (3,3): probability = 1/3 · 1/6 = 1/18.

Adding these, we get: (1/9 + 1/9 + 1/9) + (1/18 + 1/18 + 1/18) = 3/9 + 3/18 = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.

Thus, the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square is ½.","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True

We can show the steps briefly:

1. Notice that 
  sin 20° = sin 160°, sin 40° = sin 140°, sin 60° = sin 120°, sin 80° = sin 100°.
Thus, the original product can be grouped as:
  [sin20° ⋅ sin160°] [sin40° ⋅ sin140°] [sin60° ⋅ sin120°] [sin80° ⋅ sin100°]
  which simplifies to
  sin²20° ⋅ sin²40° ⋅ sin²60° ⋅ sin²80°.

2. Taking square roots, we can set
  P = sin20° ⋅ sin40° ⋅ sin60° ⋅ sin80°,
so that the full product becomes P².

3. Using the fact that sin60° = √3/2, we have:
  P = (√3/2) · (sin20° ⋅ sin40° ⋅ sin80°).

4. A known trigonometric identity gives:
  sin20° ⋅ sin40° ⋅ sin80° = (√3)/8.
Thus, 
  P = (√3/2) ⋅ (√3/8) = 3/16.

5. Squaring P yields
  P² = (3/16)² = 9/256.

Hence, the value of the given product is \boxed{\frac{9}{256}}.","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

We describe one solution below.

Place the trapezoid with vertices A, B, C, D in order so that the only pair of parallel sides are AD and BC. Choose coordinates so that

  A = (0, 0)  and  D = (a, 0).

Since AD ∥ BC the other base BC is horizontal. Write

  B = (x_B, h)  and  C = (x_C, h),  with h > 0.

Then the bases have lengths AD = a and BC = x_C – x_B, and the area is
  [ABCD] = ½ (a + (x_C – x_B))·h = 42.  (∗)

We are also given two conditions:
1. Diagonal AC bisects ∠BAD.
2. AC ⟂ CD.

The diagonal AC runs from A = (0, 0) to C = (x_C, h). Because AC bisects ∠BAD (the angle between the vectors AB and AD), its direction must be the “average” of the directions of AD and AB. Taking AD = (a, 0) (horizontal) and AB = (x_B, h), one may show that a convenient choice is to set x_B = 0. (In other words, choose B = (0, h).) Then the ray AB is vertical and AD is horizontal; thus ∠BAD = 90° whose bisector is at 45° and has slope 1.

With x_B = 0 the bisector line from A, namely AC, must lie along y = x. And since C = (x_C, h) lies on y = x we deduce
  x_C = h.
But then BC = x_C – x_B = h – 0 = h and C = (h, h).

For the second condition, AC ⟂ CD, we use the fact that
  AC = C – A = (h, h)
  CD = D – C = (a – h, 0 – h) = (a – h, -h).

The dot product must vanish:
  AC · CD = h(a – h) + h(–h) = h(a – h) – h² = 0.
This gives
  h(a – h) = h² ⟹ a – h = h ⟹ a = 2h.

Now update the trapezoid’s area (∗). We have a = 2h and BC = h so
  42 = ½ (2h + h)·h = ½·3h² ⟹ h² = 28 ⹧ h = 2√7.
Thus a = 2h = 4√7.

A convenient coordinate set is now:
  A = (0, 0),
  B = (0, 2√7),
  C = (2√7, 2√7),
  D = (4√7, 0).

We now need [△ACD] with vertices

To explain briefly: The inequality

Since the absolute value in the numerator is always nonnegative, the fraction is negative only when the numerator is positive (i.e. when x ≠ 9 and x ≠ -9) and the denominator is negative.

We let the shorter side of the field have length 2r so that the two semicircles attached to it have radius r each. The track’s total length consists of the two straight segments (each of length L) plus the circumference of a full circle of radius r (coming from the two semicircular ends). That gives

  2L + 2πr = 400.

Thus, L = 200 - πr.

The area of the field is

  A = L · (2r) = 2r(200 - πr) = 400r - 2πr².

This is a quadratic in r that opens downward, so its maximum occurs when

  r = - (400)/(2·(-2π)) = 100/π.

Substituting back, the maximum area is

  A = 400(100/π) - 2π(100/π)² = 40000/π - 20000/π = 20000/π.
