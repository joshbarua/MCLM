"To solve for the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   Multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) (which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)) gives:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}

   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can each choose a different book from a selection of 8 books, given that each person can only choose one book and no two people can choose the same book.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **First choice**: Pierre has 8 options to choose from.
2. **Second choice**: After Pierre has chosen a book, Rosa has 7 options left.
3. **Third choice**: After both Pierre and Rosa have chosen their books, Thomas has 6 options left.

To find the total number of ways they can each choose a different book, we multiply the number of choices each person has:

\[
8 \times 7 \times 6
\]

Now, let's perform the multiplication:

\[
8 \times 7 = 56
\]
\[
56 \times 6 = 336

Therefore, the total number of ways Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can each choose a different book is \(\boxed{336}\).","[336, '336']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the coefficient of the term containing \(x^5\) in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x^5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, we simplify the expression for the general term:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k
\]

This simplifies further to:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-3k} x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{15-5k}
\]

We need the exponent of \(x\) to be 5, so we set up the equation:

\[
15 - 5k = 5
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 5 \implies 10 = 5k \implies k = 2
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 2\) back into the general term to find the coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{2} 10^{5-2} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 x^{15-5(2)} = \binom{5}{2} 10^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 x^5

We calculate each part of the expression:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^3 = 1000
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Multiplying these together gives:

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the value of \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \mod 7 \).

First, substitute \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

So, the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

Now, reduce \( 24 \mod 7 \):

\[

"To find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram given vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\) with \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\). We need to find the coordinates of \(D\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \(AB\) and \(CD\). The midpoint of \(AB\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

The midpoint of \(CD\) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) can be factored as:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match this form. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different way.

Notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

This is a known algebraic identity for the sum of a geometric series. The expression \(100^3 - 1\) can be factored as:
\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1) = 99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1).\]

So, we have:

"To find the value of \( C \) such that the inequality \(\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|\) holds for any vector \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is the maximum value of \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express \(\|A\mathbf{v}\|\) in terms of the components of \(\mathbf{v}\). If \(\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), then
\[ A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}. \]
The norm of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is
\[ \|A\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}. \]
The norm of \(\mathbf{v}\) is
\[ \|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}. \]
We need to find the maximum value of
\[ \frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}. \]
Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then \( x = ty \), and the expression becomes
\[ \sqrt{\frac{4(ty)^2 + 12(ty)y + 13y^2}{(ty)^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2y^2 + 12ty^2 + 13y^2}{t^2y^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{y^2(4t^2 + 12t + 13)}{y^2(t^2 + 1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}}. \]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \). We take the derivative of \( g(t) \) and set it to zero:
\[ g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2}. \]
Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we get
\[ -12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0. \]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
\[ t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}. \]
This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \). We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):
\[ g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16, \]
\[ g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1, \]
\[ \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} g(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4. \]
The maximum value of \( g(t) \) is 16, so the maximum value of \( f(t) \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). Therefore, the value of \( C \) is
\[ \boxed{4}. \]","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True

In this problem, the base is 1 and the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we can conclude:

\[1^{(2^{235423523})} = 1.\]

"Given that \( z \) is a fifth root of unity and \( z \neq 1 \), we know that \( z^5 = 1 \). This implies that \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \). We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \).

First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as:
\[
z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.

Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert the base-9 numbers to base-10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base-10.
3. Convert the result back to base-9.

Let's start with the conversion of \(58_9\) to base-10. The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

Next, we convert \(18_9\) to base-10. The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

Now, we perform the subtraction in base-10:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

Finally, we convert \(36_{10}\) back to base-9. To do this, we divide 36 by 9 and find the quotient and the remainder:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the polynomial \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) added to \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we need to consider the polynomial equation:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a) + (4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6

First, combine the like terms on the left-hand side:

\[
(3t^2 + 4t^2) + (5t + bt) + (a - 2) = 7t^2 + (5 + b)t + (a - 2)
\]

Since the left-hand side must equal the right-hand side, we equate the coefficients of the corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. The coefficient of \(t^4\) on the left-hand side is 0, but on the right-hand side it is 12. This indicates that there is no \(t^4\) term on the left-hand side, so we need to consider the possibility that the polynomial on the left-hand side is actually a part of a larger polynomial that includes \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\) as a result of some other operation. However, since the problem does not specify any other operation, we need to re-euce the problem statement or recheck the problem statement.

Substitute the known values into the volume formula:

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[ 20\pi = 4\pi h \]

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects the line \(y = x\) at exactly one point, we need to solve the equation \(f(x) = x\) for both cases of the piecewise function.

**Case 1: \(x \geq a\)**

In this case, \(f(x) = ax^2\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[ax^2 = x.\]
Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ax^2 - x = 0.\]
Factoring out \(x\), we get:
\[x(ax - 1) = 0.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{1}{a}.\]
For \(x = 0\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we need:
\[0 \geq a \quad \text{or} \quad a \leq 0.\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{a}\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x \geq a\). Therefore, we need:
\[\frac{1}{a} \geq a.\]
If \(a > 0\), multiplying both sides by \(a\) gives:
\[1 \geq a^2 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 \leq 1 \quad \text{or} \quad -1 \leq a \leq 1.\]
Since \(a > 0\), we have:
\[0 < a \leq 1.\]
If \(a < 0\), multiplying both sides by \(a\) (and reversing the inequality sign) gives:
\[1 \leq a^2 \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 \geq 1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq 1.\]
Since \(a < 0\), we have:
\[a \leq -1.\]
Combining these results, the solutions for Case 1 are:
\[a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad 0 < a \leq 1.\]

**Case 2: \(x < a\)**

In this case, \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). Setting \(f(x) = x\), we get:
\[ax + 2a = x.\]
Rearranging the equation, we have:
\[ax - x = -2a.\]
Factoring out \(x\) on the left side, we get:
\[x(a - 1) = -2a.\]
If \(a \neq 1\), we can solve for \(x\):
\[x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}.\]
For \(x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x < a\). Therefore, we need:
\[\frac{-2a}{a - 1} < a.\]
If \(a > 1\), multiplying both sides by \(a - 1\) (and reversing the inequality sign) gives:
\[-2a > a(a - 1) \quad \text{or} \quad -2a > a^2 - a \quad \text{or} \quad 0 > a^2 + a \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 + a < 0.\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a + 1) < 0.\]
This inequality is satisfied when:
\[-1 < a < 0.\]
Since \(a > 1\), there are no solutions in this range.
If \(a < 1\), multiplying both sides by \(a - 1\) (and reversing the inequality sign if \(a < 1\)) gives:
\[-2a < a(a - 1) \quad \text{or} \quad -2a < a^2 - a \quad \text{or} \quad 0 < a^2 + a \quad \text{or} \quad a^2 + a > 0.\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a + 1) > 0.\]
This inequality is satisfied when:
\[a < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a > 0.\]
Since \(a < 1\), the solutions are:
\[a < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad 0 < a < 1.\]
Combining these results, the solutions for Case 2 are:
\[a < -1 \quad \text{or} \quad 0 < a < 1.\]

To have exactly one intersection point, the solutions from Case 1 and Case 2 must be mutually exclusive. This occurs when \(a = -1\) or \(a = 1\). However, \(a = 1\) does not satisfy the condition for Case 2 (since it would make the denominator zero), so the only solution is:
\[a = -1.\]

"To determine the value of \( c \) such that the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with radius 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\).

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constant terms:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the value of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) for which \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
The inequality \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is equivalent to \(\lambda \geq 1\), and the inequality \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\) is always true for \(\lambda > 0\). Therefore, the fixed points are \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2. We start by finding \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions: \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). We already know that \(x = 0\) is a fixed point, so we focus on the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, so it must also satisfy this equation. Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left(-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1}\right) = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda \neq 1\) (otherwise \(x = 0\) is the only fixed point), we have:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1} = 0.
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + \lambda^3 - \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda + 1 = -\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda + 1 = -2\lambda + 1.
\]
Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[
-2\lambda + 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
However, we need to check if \(\lambda = 2\) is a solution. Substituting \(\lambda = 2\) into the equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = -16x^3 + 4(4 + 4)x^2 - 4(1 + 2)x + 4 - 1 = -16x^3 + 32x^2 - 12x + 3.
\]
We need to check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root of this equation:
\[
-16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 32\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -16 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 32 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -2 + 8 - 6 + 3 = 3 \neq 0.

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given expression

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by using the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

We can rewrite the numerator and the denominator using these formulas. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

This can be grouped as:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

This can be grouped as:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula, we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Now, substitute these results back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this, we use the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). Thus, the expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator and the denominator. The sum-to-product identities are:

\[
\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right),
\]
\[
\sin A - \cos B = \sin A - \sin(90^\circ - B) = 2 \cos\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right).
\]

Applying these identities, we get:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,
\]

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos\left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = -2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Since \(\cos 55^\circ = \sin 35^\circ\), the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Therefore, \(\theta = 120^\circ\) (since \(\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}\)). The final answer is:

"To solve the problem of finding the equation of the ellipse given the conditions, we need to follow these steps:

2. Use the given conditions to determine the values of the constants in the equation.

The standard form of the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with the major and minor axes along the coordinate axes is:

where \(a\) is the length of the semi-major axis and \(b\) is the length of the semi-minor axis.

From the problem, we know:
- The length of the major axis is 10.
- The length of the minor axis is 6.

The length of the semi-major axis \(a\) is half of the length of the major axis:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We do this by dividing 42 by 5, then dividing the quotient by 5 again, and so on, until the quotient is less than 5. The sum of these quotients gives us the number of trailing zeros.

Let's perform the calculations step by step:

1. Divide 42 by 5:
   \[
   42 \div 5 = 8.4
   \]
   The integer part of 8.4 is 8. So, there are 8 factors of 5 in the first part.

2. Divide 8 by 5:
   \[
   8 \div 5 = 1.6
   \]
   The integer part of 1.6 is 1. So, there is 1 factor of 5 in the second part.

3. Divide 1 by 5:
   \[
   1 \div 5 = 0.2
   \]
   The integer part of 0.2 is 0. So, there are 0 factors of 5 in the third part.

Adding up all the factors of 5, we get:

First, let's check the value of \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the square \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\):
1. At \( (1, 0) \):
   \[
   f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = 1.

Next, let's consider the function along the line \( x = y \). If \( x = y \), then:

We need to find the maximum value of \( g(x) = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( g(x) \) and set it to zero:
\[
g'(x) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting \( g'(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[
2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.

Evaluating \( g(x) \) at these points:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product of \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). First, we calculate the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

Substituting \(\overrightarrow{u} = \overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \overrightarrow{OB}\), we get:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}

We expand this determinant along the first row:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)

Simplifying each component:
\[
\mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The golden ratio satisfies the quadratic equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). We can use this property to find the powers of \( z \). First, let's express \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) in terms of \( z + \frac{1}{z} \):

\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2 = (\phi + 1) - 2 = \phi - 1. \]

Next, we find \( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \):

\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 - 2 = (\phi - 1)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2\phi + 1 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2\phi - 1 = (\phi + 1) - 2\phi - 1 = -\phi. \]

Then, we find \( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} \):

\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right)^2 - 2 = (-\phi)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2 = (\phi + 1) - 2 = \phi - 1. \]

We observe that \( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). This suggests a periodicity in the powers of \( z + \frac{1}{z} \) with a period of 6. To confirm, we find \( z^{12} + \frac{1}{z^{12}} \):

\[ z^{12} + \frac{1}{z^{12}} = \left( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} \right)^2 - 2. \]

Since \( z^6 + \frac{1}{z^6} = z^0 + \frac{1}{z^0} = 1 + 1 = 2 \), we have:

First, recall that the centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

The centroid \( G \) also divides the triangle into six smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of each of these smaller triangles is \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the area of the original triangle \( \triangle ABC \).

Given that the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is 144, the area of each of the six smaller triangles is:
\[
\frac{144}{6} = 24
\]

Now, consider the triangle \( \triangle EGN \). This triangle is formed by connecting the centroid \( G \) to the points \( M \) and \( N \), where \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \) and \( N \) is the midpoint of \( AC \). The triangle \( \triangle EGN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) and is one of the six smaller triangles formed by the medians of \( \triangle ABC \).

Since \( \triangle EGN \) is one of these six smaller triangles, its area is:
\[

Thus, the area of \( \triangle EGN \) is:

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \), where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone. We are given that the radius of the base \( r \) is 30 cm and the height \( h \) is 6.5 cm.

First, we need to calculate the area of the base \( B \). The base of the cone is a circle, so we use the formula for the area of a circle, which is \( B = \pi r^2 \). Substituting the given radius:

\[
B = \pi (30)^2 = \pi \times 900 = 900\pi \text{ square cm}

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a decimal, we start by simplifying the denominator. The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\), which can be rewritten as \(4 \cdot 78125\). However, it is more useful to keep it in its prime factorized form for now.

The fraction is \(\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}\). To convert this fraction into a decimal, we need to express it with a power of 10 in the denominator. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to make the denominator \(2^7 \cdot 5^7 = 10^7\).

So, we have:
\[
\frac{21}{4 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{4 \cdot 2^5 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10000000}

Now, we can write \(\frac{672}{10000000}\) as a decimal by placing the numerator 672 in a decimal with 7 digits after the decimal point:
\[

"To determine the range of values that ni nambari ngapi chanya za tarakimu mbili ambaso ni vipangele vya 100 na 150, we need to understand the structure of the number.

Given the constraints:
- The digit ""n1"" (the first digit) must be 1.
- The digit ""n0"" (the last digit) must be 0.
- The digits ""n2"" through ""n9"" can each be any digit from 0 to 9.

"To determine the value of \( n \) such that \( n \) is a divisor of \( 2^{24} \) and \( n^{\text{th}} \) is also a divisor of \( 2^{24} \), we start by analyzing the properties of the divisors of \( 2^{24} \).

The number \( 2^{24} \) is a power of 2, and its divisors are all of the form \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is an integer and \( 0 \leq k \leq 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be of the form \( 2^m \) for some integer \( m \) such that \( 0 \leq m \leq 24 \).

Next, we need to ensure that \( n^{\text{th}} \) is also a divisor of \( 2^{24} \). Since \( n = 2^m \), we have \( n^{\text{th}} = (2^m)^n = 2^{mn} \). For \( 2^{mn} \) to be a divisor of \( 2^{24} \), it must be true that \( mn \leq 24 \).

We now need to find the largest possible value of \( n \) such that \( mn \leq 24 \) for some integer \( m \) in the range \( 0 \leq m \leq 24 \). This means we need to find the largest \( n \) such that \( n \leq \frac{24}{m} \) for some \( m \) in the range \( 0 \leq m \leq 24 \).

The largest possible value of \( n \) occurs when \( m = 1 \), because \( \frac{24}{1} = 24 \). Therefore, the largest possible value of \( n \) is \( 24 \).

To verify, if \( n = 24 \), then \( n^{\text{th}} = 24^1 = 24 \), and \( 24 \) is indeed a divisor of \( 2^{24} \).

Thus, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{24}\).","[24, '24']",7,"[7, '7']",False

"To determine the number of triangles formed by the given grid and diagonals, we need to analyze the structure of the grid and the lines drawn.

The grid is a 3x4 grid, which means it has 4 horizontal lines and 3 vertical lines. The diagonals drawn are from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the vertices of the triangles:**
   - The vertices of the triangles are the points where the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines intersect.
   - The horizontal lines are at \( y = 0, 1, 2, 3 \).
   - The vertical lines are at \( x = 0, 1, 2, 3 \).
   - The diagonals are \( y = -x + 4 \) and \( y = -2x + 4 \).

2. **Find the intersection points:**
   - The intersection of the diagonal \( y = -x + 4 \) with the vertical lines:
     - At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 4 \) (top-left corner)
     - At \( x = 1 \), \( y = 3 \)
     - At \( x = 2 \), \( y = 2 \)
     - At \( x = 3 \), \( y = 1 \)
   - The intersection of the diagonal \( y = -2x + 4 \) with the vertical lines:
     - At \( x = 0 \), \( y = 4 \) (top-left corner)
     - At \( x = 1 \), \( y = 2 \)
     - At \( x = 2 \), \( y = 0 \)
     - At \( x = 3 \), \( y = -2 \) (not within the grid)

3. **Count the triangles:**
   - We need to count the triangles formed by the points of intersection within the grid.
   - The points of intersection are:
     - \( (0, 4) \)
     - \( (1, 3) \)
     - \( (2, 2) \)
     - \( (3, 1) \)
     - \( (0, 4) \)
     - \( (1, 2) \)
     - \( (2, 0) \)

   - We can form triangles by selecting any three points from these seven points, but we need to ensure that they form a triangle (i.e., they are not collinear).

4. **Check for collinear points:**
   - The points \( (0, 4) \), \( (1, 3) \), and \( (2, 2) \) are collinear.
   - The points \( (0, 4) \), \( (1, 2) \), and \( (2, 0) \) are collinear.
   - The points \( (1, 3) \), \( (2, 2) \), and \( (3, 1) \) are collinear.
   - The points \( (1, 2) \), \( (2, 0) \), and \( (3, 1) \) are collinear.

   - Therefore, we need to exclude these sets of collinear points from our count.

5. **Calculate the number of valid triangles:**
   - The total number of ways to choose 3 points from 7 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{7}{3} \):
     \[
     \binom{7}{3} = \frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \frac{7 \times 6 \times 5}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 35
     \]
   - Subtract the number of collinear sets (4 sets):
     \[
     35 - 4 = 31

This leaves us with the digits ""1"", ""2"", ""3"", and ""4"" to arrange in the remaining three positions.

The number of ways to arrange 4 distinct digits in 3 positions is given by the permutation formula \( P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( r \) is the number of items to choose. Here, \( n = 4 \) and \( r = 3 \), so we have:

\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape of the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \) for all points on the surface. This describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}
\]

Therefore, the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\pi}{6}}\).","[pi/6, '\\frac{\\pi}{6}']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",False
"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the roots of \( f(x) \). The roots of \( f(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( f(x) = 0 \). Let's denote the roots of \( f(x) \) by \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). Therefore, we have:
\[ f(r_1) = 0, \quad f(r_2) = 0, \quad f(r_3) = 0. \]

The function \( g(x) \) is defined as \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). To find the roots of \( g(x) \), we need to solve the equation \( g(x) = 0 \):
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0. \]
This equation tells us that \( x + 5 \) must be one of the roots of \( f(x) \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are:
\[ x + 5 = r_1 \implies x = r_1 - 5, \]
\[ x + 5 = r_2 \implies x = r_2 - 5, \]
\[ x + 5 = r_3 \implies x = r_3 - 5. \]
So, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15. \]

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a = 1 \) and \( b = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Substituting this value into the expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the identity \(\tan 3x = \tan (60^\circ - 40^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 40^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 40^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 40^\circ = \tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 20^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ,

\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.

Using the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = 5.9444\ldots
\]

Since \(n-2\) must be an integer (because \(n\) is the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\ldots\) to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

Adding 2 to both sides of the equation gives:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the value of \( t \) such that \( t+2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \). Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Understand the congruence**: The congruence \( t+2 \equiv t \pmod{23} \) means that the difference between \( t+2 \) and \( t \) is a multiple of 23. Mathematically, this can be written as:
   \[
   (t+2) - t \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
   \]
   This statement is clearly false because 2 is not a multiple of 23. However, we need to re-evaluate the problem because there might be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem statement.

2. **Re-evaluate the problem**: The problem states that \( t+2 \) is a kinyume of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that \( t+2 \) should be congruent to \( t \) modulo 23. But if we re-interpret the problem as finding \( t \) such that \( t+2 \) is a multiple of 23, then we need to find \( t \) such that:
   \[
   t+2 = 23k \text{ for some integer } k
   \]
   Rearranging this equation, we get:
   \[
   t = 23k - 2
   \]
   Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), we need to find \( k \) such that:
   \[
   0 < 23k - 2 < 23
   \]
   Adding 2 to all parts of the inequality, we get:
   \[
   2 < 23k < 25
   \]
   Dividing all parts by 23, we get:
   \[
   \frac{2}{23} < k < \frac{25}{23}
   \]
   Since \( k \) is an integer, the only possible value for \( k \) is 1. Substituting \( k = 1 \) back into the equation \( t = 23k - 2 \), we get:
   \[
   t = 23 \cdot 1 - 2 = 21

Therefore, the value of \( t \) is \(\boxed{21}\).","[21, '21']",17,"[17, '17']",False

3. **Determine the relationship between the characters:**

"To determine the number of terms in the arithmetic sequence 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., that sum to 2003, we start by identifying the first term \(a\) and the common difference \(d\) of the sequence. Here, \(a = 1\) and \(d = 2\).

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d)
\]
Substituting the values of \(a\) and \(d\) into the formula, we get:
\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2 \cdot 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2) = \frac{n}{2} (2 + 2n - 2) = \frac{n}{2} \cdot 2n = n^2
\]
We need to find \(n\) such that \(S_n = 2003\). Therefore, we solve the equation:
\[
n^2 = 2003
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
n = \sqrt{2003}

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we check the value of \(\sqrt{2003}\). We find that:
\[
44^2 = 1936 \quad \text{and} \quad 45^2 = 2025
\]
Since \(1936 < 2003 < 2025\), it follows that \(n\) is not an integer. Therefore, there is no integer \(n\) such that the sum of the first \(n\) terms of the sequence is exactly 2003.

"To find the value of \( t \) and \( u \) such that the two given lines intersect, we need to set the parametric equations equal to each other and solve the resulting system of equations.

The parametric equations of the first line are:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 2t \\ -10 - 9t \\ 1 - 2t \end{pmatrix}
\]

The parametric equations of the second line are:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 + 4u \\ -3 - 18u \\ 6 - 4u \end{pmatrix}
\]

We set the corresponding components equal to each other:
\[
\begin{cases}
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u \\
-10 - 9t = -3 - 18u \\
1 - 2t = 6 - 4u
\end{cases}
\]

We will solve this system step by step.

**Step 1: Solve the first equation for \( t \) in terms of \( u \):**
\[
3 + 2t = -5 + 4u
\]
Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
2t = -8 + 4u
\]
Divide by 2:
\[
t = -4 + 2u
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( t = -4 + 2u \) into the second equation:**
\[
-10 - 9(-4 + 2u) = -3 - 18u
\]
Simplify inside the parentheses:
\[
-10 + 36 - 18u = -3 - 18u
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
26 - 18u = -3 - 18u
\]
Add \( 18u \) to both sides:
\[
26 = -3
\]

This is a contradiction, which means there is no solution for \( t \) and \( u \) that satisfies all three equations simultaneously. Therefore, the lines do not intersect.

**Conclusion:**
The lines do not intersect, so there is no value for \( t \) and \( u \) that makes the lines intersect. The problem statement might have an error or additional constraints not considered. Recheck the problem statement for any additional information or constraints.

Given the problem statement and the calculations, the lines do not intersect. The problem might need re-evaluation or additional information. Recheck the problem statement for any additional information or constraints.

"To determine the area of the rectangle formed by the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to calculate the length and width of the rectangle and then use the formula for the area of a rectangle, which is length times width.

First, let's find the length of the rectangle. The length is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((-5,4)\). Since these points have the same \(y\)-coordinate, the length is simply the difference in their \(x\)-coordinates:
\[
5 - (-5) = 5 + 5 = 10
\]

Next, let's find the width of the rectangle. The width is the distance between the points \((5,4)\) and \((5,-4)\). Since these points have the same \(x\)-coordinate, the width is simply the difference in their \(y\)-coordinates:
\[
4 - (-4) = 4 + 4 = 8
\]

Now that we have the length and width, we can calculate the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 10 \times 8 = 80
\]

Therefore, the area of the rectangle is \(\boxed{80}\).","[80, '80']",63,"[63, '63']",False
"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(CD = h\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times AC
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height \(AC\) and the base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(CD = h\). The base of \(\triangle ABC\) is \(BC = b\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times AC
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times h \times AC + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (h + b)
\]

We already know that \((a + b) \times h = 84\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the height \(AC\) is the same for both triangles, and the sum of the bases of the triangles is \(a + b\). Therefore, we can substitute \(a + b\) with \(\frac{84}{h}\) in the area formula for the trapezoid:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (h + b) = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times (h + b) = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times \left(h + \frac{84}{h} - a\right)
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(CD\) and \(BC\), which is \(h : b\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{h}{h + b} \times [ABCD] = \frac{h}{h + b} \times 42
\]

Since \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we have \(h + b = \frac{84}{a}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(CD\) and \(BC\), which is \(h : b\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19} = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}

   Simplify the expression inside the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

First, identify the values of \( m \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( q \) from the fractions:
- For \( \frac{7}{30} \), \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 30 \).
- For \( \frac{10}{21} \), \( p = 10 \) and \( q = 21 \).

Next, substitute these values into the operation formula:

"To determine the relationship between the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) given that they are both parallel to the same plane and intersect the same plane at different points, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the given conditions:**
   - \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel to the same plane.
   - \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect the same plane at different points.

2. **Analyze the implications of these conditions:**
   - Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel to the same plane, they do not intersect each other. If they did, they would lie in the same plane and be parallel to the given plane, which would mean they are parallel to each other.
   - Since \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect the same plane at different points, they must be skew lines. Skew lines are lines that are not parallel and do not intersect.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The only possible relationship between \(AB\) and \(CD\) given the conditions is that they are skew lines.

"To solve for the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by analyzing the given information and the geometric properties of the circles and the line segments.

1. **Identify the radii and the given area relationship:**
   - The radius of the smaller circle is \(1\).
   - The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   - The sum of the areas of the two segments formed by the line segment \(AD\) in the circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

2. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

3. **Determine the sum of the areas of the two segments:**
   \[
   \text{Sum of the areas of the two segments} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

4. **Understand the segments formed by \(AD\):**
   - The segment \(AD\) in the smaller circle forms a segment with area \(A_1\).
   - The segment \(AD\) in the larger circle forms a segment with area \(A_2\).
   - Therefore, \(A_1 + A_2 = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

5. **Express the areas of the segments in terms of the central angles:**
   - The area of a segment in a circle is given by \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi r^2 - \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin \theta\), where \(\theta\) is the central angle in degrees.
   - For the smaller circle with radius \(1\), the area of the segment is:
     \[
     A_1 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times 1^2 - \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \sin \theta = \frac{\theta \pi}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta

   - For the larger circle with radius \(2\), the area of the segment is:

   \[
   \frac{\theta \pi}{360^\circ} + \frac{4\theta \pi}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta - 2 \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}

   \[
   \frac{5\theta \pi}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}

      \[
      \sin 120^\circ = \frac{\pi (120^\circ - 120^\circ)}{180^\circ} = \frac{\pi \cdot 0}{180^\circ} = 0

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[

The number of ways to choose 5 amb�o ina from 14 people is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{r} = \frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of people, \( r \) is the number of people to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

Here, \( n = 14 \) and \( r = 5 \). So, we need to calculate \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}

We can simplify this by canceling out the \( 9! \) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{5! \times 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5!}

Next, we need to calculate \( 5! \):

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result. Therefore, we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we can substitute this value in:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Thus, the solutions to the equation are:

"To find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. We use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we can write:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).

Therefore, we have:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we know that \(AM\) is the altitude and the median of the triangle. Let \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the length of \(BC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BM = MC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

In triangle \(ABM\), since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = 90^\circ\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Thus, \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\).

Next, consider triangle \(BDC\). Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(BD = DC = \sqrt{AB^2 - AD^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2 - 10^2} = \sqrt{21 + x^2}\), we can use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(2x)^2 = (\sqrt{21 + x^2})^2 + (\sqrt{21 + x^2})^2 - 2 \cdot (\sqrt{21 + x^2}) \cdot (\sqrt{21 + x^2}) \cdot \cos(3\theta).
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
4x^2 = 2(21 + x^2) - 2(21 + x^2) \cos(3\theta).
\]
Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
\[
2x^2 = 21 + x^2 - (21 + x^2) \cos(3\theta).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^2 = 21 - (21 + x^2) \cos(3\theta).
\]
Using the triple angle formula for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
x^2 = 21 - (21 + x^2)(4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
x^2 = 21 - 84\cos^3(\theta) + 63\cos(\theta) - 4x^2\cos^3(\theta) + 3x^2\cos(\theta).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^2 + 4x^2\cos^3(\theta) - 3x^2\cos(\theta) = 21 - 84\cos^3(\theta) + 63\cos(\theta).
\]
Factoring out \(x^2\) on the left-hand side, we get:
\[
x^2(1 + 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)) = 21 - 84\cos^3(\theta) + 63\cos(\theta).
\]
We know from triangle \(ABM\) that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\). Substituting this into the equation, we need to find a value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(x = 10\).

Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 10 = 20\).

"To determine how many upi wao w sistersum wum, we need to understand the relationship between the number of mfululiza and the number of upi wao w. According to the problem, the number of mfululiza is \(3^7\).

First, let's calculate \(3^7\):
\[
3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3
\]
We can break this down step by step:
\[

\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts and solve each part separately.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to factor the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-21\) and add up to \(4\). These numbers are \(7\) and \(-3\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
To solve the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\), we need to determine the intervals where the product is negative. The roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\) are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the product is negative.

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
   \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
   So, the product is positive in this interval.

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
   \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (0 + 7)(0 - 3) = 7(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
   So, the product is negative in this interval.

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
   \[(y + 7)(y - 3) = (4 + 7)(4 - 3) = 11(1) = 11 > 0.\]
   So, the product is positive in this interval.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have:
\[-7 < x^2 < 3.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the inequality \(-7 < x^2\) is always true. Therefore, we only need to consider the inequality \(x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by using the given equations and some algebraic identities. The equations are:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use another identity to express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]

Now, let's denote \(x+y+z\) by \(s\) and \(xy + yz + zx\) by \(p\). The equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

We also know from the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Since \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\), we have:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the equation \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\):
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now we substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

2. Calculate the number of students in the 12th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana.
3. Add the two results together.

First, let's calculate the number of students in the 11th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana. The total number of students in the 11th daraja is 300. According to the table, 20.6% of the students are taking wavulana and 13.8% are taking wasichana. Therefore, the total percentage of students taking either wavulana or wasichana is:
\[ 20.6\% + 13.8\% = 34.4\% \]
So, the number of students in the 11th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana is:
\[ 300 \times \frac{34.4}{100} = 300 \times 0.344 = 103.2 \]
Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 103.2 to the nearest whole number, which is 103.

Next, let's calculate the number of students in the 12th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana. The total number of students in the 12th daraja is 300. According to the table, 11.6% of the students are taking wavulana and 8.6% are taking wasichana. Therefore, the total percentage of students taking either wavulana or wasichana is:
\[ 11.6\% + 8.6\% = 20.2\% \]
So, the number of students in the 12th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana is:
\[ 300 \times \frac{20.2}{100} = 300 \times 0.202 = 60.6 \]
Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 60.6 to the nearest whole number, which is 61.

Finally, we add the number of students in the 11th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana to the number of students in the 12th daraja taking either wavulana or wasichana:

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x \leq -9\) and \(x < 9\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:

   Since \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x - 36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(-9 < x < 9\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x - 36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(-9 < x < 9\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x - 36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(-9 < x < 9\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:

   Since \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x - 36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(-9 < x < 9\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:

   Since \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x - 36 > 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

Combining these results, the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is satisfied in the intervals \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution is:

1. **Determine the side length of the square:**
   The problem states that the area of the square is 400 square units. The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the square. Given \( A = 400 \), we can solve for \( s \):
   \[
   s^2 = 400

   Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = \sqrt{400} = 20

2. **Determine the radius of the quarter-circles:**
   Each quarter-circle is cut out from a corner of the square. The radius \( r \) of each quarter-circle is equal to half the side length of the square:
   \[
   r = \frac{s}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10

   The area \( A_{\text{circle}} \) of a full circle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{circle}} = \pi r^2
   \]
   For a quarter-circle, the area is one-fourth of the area of the full circle:
   \[
   A_{\text{quarter-circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi r^2

   Substituting \( r = 10 \):
   \[
   A_{\text{quarter-circle}} = \frac{1}{4} \pi (10)^2 = \frac{1}{4} \pi \cdot 100 = 25\pi

4. **Calculate the total area of the four quarter-circles:**
   Since there are four quarter-circles, the total area \( A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} \) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{total quarter-circles}} = 4 \times 25\pi = 100\pi

5. **Calculate the area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region is the area of the square minus the total area of the four quarter-circles:

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In \(\triangle RST\), the Pythagorean theorem gives:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"To find the maximum value of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by analyzing the expression inside the function. The term \( x^2 - 3 \) is a quadratic function in \( x \), and it achieves its minimum value when \( x = 0 \). At \( x = 0 \), the value of \( x^2 - 3 \) is:

\[
x^2 - 3 = 0^2 - 3 = -3
\]

Since the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is positive, the parabola opens upwards, and the minimum value of \( x^2 - 3 \) is \(-3\). Therefore, the minimum value of \( y \) is:

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The maximum value of \( y \) does not exist because the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) increases without bound as \( x \) moves away from 0 in either direction. However, the problem seems to have a misinterpretation or a different context for the maximum value. Given the problem's context, it appears there might be a different interpretation or a different function to consider.

Given the problem's context, let's consider the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) and its minimum value. The minimum value of \( y \) is \( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \), and the problem states that the maximum value is \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \). This might be a different function or a different context.

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us one solution \( x = 0 \), but since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We need to solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us two solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \), but since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid. Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Since \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), it is not a valid solution. We need to check if there are any other real roots. However, since we are only asked to find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \) and we have already found \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \), we do not need to find the other roots.

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

"To find the length of the line segment \(OP\) where \(O\) is the center of the octahedron and \(P\) is a point such that the distances from \(P\) to the vertices of the octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we start by noting the coordinates of the vertices of the octahedron. The octahedron can be inscribed in a cube with side length \(s\), and the center of the octahedron is also the center of the cube. If the side length of the cube is \(s\), then the distance from the center of the cube to any vertex is \(\frac{s\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Let's place the octahedron in a coordinate system such that the center of the octahedron is at the origin \(O = (0,0,0)\). The vertices of the octahedron are then \((\pm s/2, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm s/2, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm s/2)\).

The distance from \(P = (x, y, z)\) to any vertex is given by the Euclidean distance formula. For example, the distance from \(P\) to the vertex \((s/2, 0, 0)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
We are given that the distances from \(P\) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Without loss of generality, let's assume the distances are in ascending order. Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3, \quad \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 11, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2} = 7, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + \left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2} = 9, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2} = 8
\]

Squaring each equation, we get:
\[
\left(x - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9, \quad \left(x + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 121, \quad x^2 + \left(y - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 49, \quad x^2 + \left(y + \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 81, \quad x^2 + y^2 + \left(z - \frac{s}{2}\right)^2 = 64
\]

Expanding each equation, we have:
\[
x^2 - sx + \frac{s^2}{4} + y^2 + z^2 = 9, \quad x^2 + sx + \frac{s^2}{4} + y^2 + z^2 = 121, \quad x^2 + y^2 - sy + \frac{s^2}{4} + z^2 = 49, \quad x^2 + y^2 + sy + \frac{s^2}{4} + z^2 = 81, \quad x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - sz + \frac{s^2}{4} = 64
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:
\[
2sx = 112 \implies x = \frac{56}{s}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the third, we get:
\[
sy = 40 \implies y = \frac{40}{s}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the fourth, we get:
\[
sy = 72 \implies y = \frac{72}{s}
\]

Subtracting the first equation from the fifth, we get:
\[
sz = 55 \implies z = \frac{55}{s}
\]

Since \(y\) cannot simultaneously be \(\frac{40}{s}\) and \(\frac{72}{s}\), we need to re-evaluate our approach. Instead, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant and equal to \(4s^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)\). Therefore, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 4s^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 4s^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]
\[
324 = 4s^2 + 4(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
\]
\[
81 = s^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2
\]

Since \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = OP^2\), we have:
\[
OP^2 = 81 - s^2
\]

From the equations \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 81 - s^2\) and the fact that \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = \frac{3s^2}{4}\), we get:
\[
81 - s^2 = \frac{3s^2}{4}
\]
\[
324 - 4s^2 = 3s^2
\]
\[
324 = 7s^2
\]
\[
s^2 = \frac{324}{7}
\]

Therefore, we have:
\[
OP^2 = 81 - \frac{324}{7} = \frac{567}{7} - \frac{324}{7} = \frac{243}{7}
\]
\[
OP = \sqrt{\frac{243}{7}} = \frac{9\sqrt{7}}{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to convert the given base-10 numbers to base-7 and base-5, and then find the sum of these numbers.

First, let's convert \(629_{10}\) to base-7.

1. Divide 629 by 7:
   \[
   629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
   \]
   So, the least significant digit (rightmost) is 6.

2. Divide 89 by 7:
   \[
   89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
   \]
   So, the next digit is 5.

3. Divide 12 by 7:
   \[
   12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
   \]
   So, the next digit is 5.

4. Divide 1 by 7:
   \[
   1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
   \]
   So, the most significant digit (leftmost) is 1.

Therefore, \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

Next, let's convert \(121_3\) to base-10.

1. Write down the base-3 number and its place values:
   \[
   121_3 = 1 \cdot 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0
   \]

2. Calculate each term:
   \[
   1 \cdot 3^2 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
   \]
   \[
   2 \cdot 3^1 = 2 \cdot 3 = 6
   \]
   \[
   1 \cdot 3^0 = 1 \cdot 1 = 1
   \]

3. Add the results:
   \[
   9 + 6 + 1 = 16

Therefore, \(121_3 = 16_{10}\).

Next, let's convert \(413_5\) to base-10.

1. Write down the base-5 number and its place values:

2. Calculate each term:
   \[
   4 \cdot 5^2 = 4 \cdot 25 = 100

   \[
   1 \cdot 5^1 = 1 \cdot 5 = 5

   \[
   3 \cdot 5^0 = 3 \cdot 1 = 3

3. Add the results:
   \[
   100 + 5 + 3 = 108

Therefore, \(413_5 = 108_{10}\).

Now, we need to find the sum of \(1556_7\) and \(16_{10}\) and \(108_{10}\).

First, convert \(1556_7\) to base-10.

1. Write down the base-7 number and its place values:
   \[
   1556_7 = 1 \cdot 7^3 + 5 \cdot 7^2 + 5 \cdot 7^1 + 6 \cdot 7^0
   \]

2. Calculate each term:
   \[
   1 \cdot 7^3 = 1 \cdot 343 = 343
   \]
   \[
   5 \cdot 7^2 = 5 \cdot 49 = 245
   \]
   \[
   5 \cdot 7^1 = 5 \cdot 7 = 35
   \]
   \[
   6 \cdot 7^0 = 6 \cdot 1 = 6
   \]

3. Add the results:
   \[
   343 + 245 + 35 + 6 = 629
   \]

Therefore, \(1556_7 = 629_{10}\).

Finally, add \(629_{10}\), \(16_{10}\), and \(108_{10}\):
\[
629 + 16 + 108 = 753
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:

\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \):

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\).

Starting with \(y = 2x - 2\), we can rearrange it as:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

Simplify the numerator and the denominator:

\[

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)

\[a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0\]

We also know from the identity for the square of the sum of the roots:

\[4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2\]

We can express \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 4 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4\]

Let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = x\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = y\). Then \(x + y = -2\) and:

\[4 = x^2 + y^2 - 2a\]

Since \(x + y = -2\), we have \(x^2 + y^2 = (x + y)^2 - 2xy = 4 - 2xy\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[4 = 4 - 2xy - 2a\]
\[0 = -2xy - 2a\]
\[a = -xy\]

Similarly, we can find \(b\) and \(c\):

\[b = -(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4) = -(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_3) = -(-2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3) - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)^2) = 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)^2\]
\[c = -(\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3) = -(\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)(-2 - \alpha_1 - \alpha_4) = -(-2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)^2) = 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)^2\]

Since \(a + b + c = 0\), we have:

\[-xy - 4 - 2\alpha_3 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)^2 - 4 - 2\alpha_4 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)^2 = 0\]
\[-xy - 8 - 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)^2 = 0\]

\[(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)^2 = xy + 4\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we have \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_2\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_4\alpha_2\alpha_3 = 2\).

"To determine how much more penseli tano costs than penseli tatu, we need to subtract the cost of penseli tatu from the cost of penseli tano. The cost of penseli tatu is $1.24 and the cost of penseli tano is $1.82. Let's perform the subtraction step by step.

First, align the numbers by their decimal points:
\[
\begin{array}{r}

\]

Next, subtract the numbers starting from the rightmost digit (the hundredths place):
\[
2 - 4 = -2 \quad \text{(we need to borrow 1 from the tenths place)}
\]
Since we can't subtract 4 from 2, we borrow 1 from the tenths place. This changes the 8 in the tenths place to 7 and the 2 in the hundredths place to 12. Now we can subtract:
\[
12 - 4 = 8

Next, subtract the digits in the tenths place:
\[
7 - 2 = 5

Finally, subtract the digits in the ones place:
\[
1 - 1 = 0

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) to a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, we need to add a decimal point and some zeros to 137 to make the division possible. This gives us 137.000.
3. Now, divide 1370 by 500. Since 500 goes into 1370 two times (because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)), we write 2 in the tenths place of the quotient.
4. Subtract 1000 from 1370 to get a remainder of 370.
5. Bring down the next 0 to make it 3700. Now, divide 3700 by 500. Since 500 goes into 3700 seven times (because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)), we write 7 in the hundredths place of the quotient.
6. Subtract 3500 from 3700 to get a remainder of 200.
7. Bring down the next 0 to make it 2000. Now, divide 2000 by 500. Since 500 goes into 2000 four times (because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)), we write 4 in the thousandths place of the quotient.
8. Subtract 2000 from 2000 to get a remainder of 0. Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the ratio of the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) to the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points where the angle bisectors of the angles at \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) intersect the opposite sides.

First, let's denote the side lengths of the rectangle \(ABCD\) as follows:
- \(AB = a\)
- \(AD = b\)
- The coordinates of the vertices are:
  - \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
  - \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
  - \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)
  - \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)

The diagonals of the rectangle intersect at point \(O\), which is the origin \((0, 0)\).

Next, we find the equations of the angle bisectors of the angles at \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

1. **Angle bisector of \(\angle A\):**
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle A\) divides \(\angle DAB\) into two equal angles.
   - The slope of \(AB\) is \(\frac{\frac{b}{2} - \frac{b}{2}}{\frac{a}{2} - (-\frac{a}{2})} = 0\).

   - The angle bisector of \(\angle A\) is the line \(y = \frac{b}{a}x\).

2. **Angle bisector of \(\angle B\):**
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle B\) divides \(\angle ABC\) into two equal angles.
   - The slope of \(BC\) is \(\frac{-\frac{b}{2} - \frac{b}{2}}{\frac{a}{2} - \frac{a}{2}} = \infty\).
   - The slope of \(AB\) is \(0\).
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle B\) is the line \(y = -\frac{b}{a}x\).

3. **Angle bisector of \(\angle C\):**
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle C\) divides \(\angle BCD\) into two equal angles.
   - The slope of \(CD\) is \(\frac{-\frac{b}{2} - (-\frac{b}{2})}{-\frac{a}{2} - \frac{a}{2}} = 0\).
   - The slope of \(BC\) is \(\infty\).
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle C\) is the line \(y = -\frac{b}{a}x\).

4. **Angle bisector of \(\angle D\):**
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle D\) divides \(\angle CDA\) into two equal angles.
   - The slope of \(DA\) is \(\frac{\frac{b}{2} - (-\frac{b}{2})}{-\frac{a}{2} - (-\frac{a}{2})} = \infty\).
   - The slope of \(CD\) is \(0\).
   - The angle bisector of \(\angle D\) is the line \(y = \frac{b}{a}x\).

The angle bisectors intersect the opposite sides at points:
- \(P\) on \(BC\)
- \(Q\) on \(CD\)
- \(R\) on \(DA\)
- \(S\) on \(AB\)

Since the angle bisectors are symmetric and the rectangle is symmetric, the points \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\), and \(S\) divide the sides into equal segments. Therefore, each segment is half the length of the side it intersects.

Thus, the coordinates of these points are:
- \(P = \left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\)
- \(Q = \left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\)
- \(R = \left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\)
- \(S = \left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\)

The quadrilateral formed by these points is a square with side length \(a\).

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area}_{ABCD} = a \times b
\]

The area of the square formed by the points \(P\), \(Q\), \(R\), and \(S\) is:
\[

\]

However, this is incorrect. The correct area of the square formed by the points where the angle bisectors intersect the opposite sides is:

Thus, the ratio of the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\) to the area of the quadrilateral formed by the points where the angle bisectors intersect the opposite sides is:

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To find the mean number of walipata alama per mtihani huuulika, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of walipata alama.
2. Calculate the total number of mtihani huuulika.
3. Divide the total number of walipata alama by the total number of mtihani huuulika to find the mean.

Let's start with the first step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of walipata alama.**

- Darasawanafunzi 30 lilifanya mtihani hivi karibuni: \(30 \times 30 = 900\) walipata alama.
- Ikiwawanafunzi 20 walipata alama 80: \(20 \times 80 = 1600\) walipata alama.
- nawanafunzi 8 walipata alama 90: \(8 \times 90 = 720\) walipata alama.
- Basi wastani wa darasha (mean) katika mtihani huuulika: \(2 \times 100 = 200\) walipata alama.

Adding these together gives:
\[900 + 1600 + 720 + 200 = 3420\]

So, the total number of walipata alama is 3420.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of mtihani huuulika.**

- Darasawanafunzi 30 lilifanya mtihani hivi karibuni: \(30\).
- Ikiwawanafunzi 20 walipata alama 80: \(20\).
- nawanafunzi 8 walipata alama 90: \(8\).
- Basi wastani wa darasha (mean) katika mtihani huuulika: \(2\).

Adding these together gives:
\[30 + 20 + 8 + 2 = 60\]

So, the total number of mtihani huuulika is 60.

**Step 3: Divide the total number of walipata alama by the total number of mtihani huuulika to find the mean.**

\[ \text{Mean} = \frac{3420}{60} = 57 \]

Therefore, the mean number of walipata alama per mtihani huuulika is \(\boxed{57}\).","[57, '57']",84,"[84, '84']",False
"To solve for \( n \) in the given grid, we need to use the information that the sum of the numbers in each row and each column is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
To find \( n \), we solve the equation:
\[
3n - 2n = 1 + 6 \implies n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
And the sum of the numbers in the fourth row:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in each column should also be equal to \( S = 2n + 1 = 2 \cdot 7 + 1 = 15 \). Let's check the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + (n-3) = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 + (7-3) = 4 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 19
\]
Oops, we made a mistake. Let's recheck the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\]
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 + (n-3) = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 + (7-3) = 4 + 9 + 2 + 4 = 19

"To determine how much more Jim anatenbea future than Martha, we need to calculate the total amount each person anatenbea and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the total amount Jim anatenbea:
- Jim na Martha wamesimama pamoja kwenye kona ya uwanja wa mstatili: \(300\)
- Jim anatenbea kwa njia ya mcheduara kuvuka uwanja: \(400\)

Adding these amounts together:
\[
300 + 400 = 700
\]

So, Jim anatenbea a total of \(700\).

Next, let's calculate the total amount Martha anatenbea:
- Martha anafika eneo lilelile kwa Kutembea kando yaurefu: \(400\)
- Martha anatenbea uwanja: \(300\)

Adding these amounts together:
\[
400 + 300 = 700
\]

So, Martha anatenbea a total of \(700\).

Now, we find the difference between the amounts Jim and Martha anatenbea:
\[
700 - 700 = 0
\]

Therefore, Jim anatenbea future the same amount as Martha. The difference is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The properties of \(\omega\) are \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\). We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]
Using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Next, we simplify the denominator. We expand \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1\) with 0:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]
Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]
Therefore, the value is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we can break it down into two triangles: \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\). We will calculate the area of each triangle separately and then sum the areas.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of \(\triangle ABD\)

The vertices of \(\triangle ABD\) are:
- \(A = (-3, 3)\)
- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(D = (0, 0)\)

We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Substituting the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):
\[
\text{Area}_{ABD} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (-3)(0 - 0) + 3(0 - 3) + 0(3 - 0) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 9 + 0 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| -9 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 9
\]
\[
= 4.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of \(\triangle BCD\)

The vertices of \(\triangle BCD\) are:
- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -4)\)
- \(D = (0, 0)\)

Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area}_{BCD} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3(-4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 3(-4) + 0 + 0 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 12
\]
\[
= 6
\]

### Step 3: Sum the areas of \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\)

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area}_{ABCD} = \text{Area}_{ABD} + \text{Area}_{BCD}
\]
\[
= 4.5 + 6
\]
\[
= 10.5
