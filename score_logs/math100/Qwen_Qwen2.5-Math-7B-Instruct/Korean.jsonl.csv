"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\angle DEF = 90^\circ\)
- \(EF = 7\)
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle D\), the opposite side is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing by 0.7:
\[
DF \cdot 0.7 = 7
\]
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7}
\]
\[
DF = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To solve for \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49
\]
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"为了找到复数 \( w \) 使得 \( z \)가 \( c \)를 中心으로 반时针方向으로 \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) amount 回转 did, 我们 can use the properties of complex numbers and their geometric interpretation.

First, let's express the rotation in terms of complex numbers. A counterclockwise rotation by an angle \( \theta \) around a point \( c \) can be achieved by the following transformation:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]
Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

Given:
\[ z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \]
\[ c = 2 - 3i \]

First, we find \( z - c \):
\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} \):
\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]
\[ = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ = 1 + i - 3i + 3 \]
\[ = 4 - 2i \]

Finally, we add \( c \) back to the result:
\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is:
\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242.

First, we check if 242 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 242 is an even number, it is divisible by 2:
\[ 242 \div 2 = 121 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 121 \]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We check if 121 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 121 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since the sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3, 121 is not divisible by 3. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 5. Since 121 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 7. Since \(121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857\), which is not an integer, 121 is not divisible by 7. We check the next smallest prime number, which is 11. Since \(121 \div 11 = 11\), which is an integer, 121 is divisible by 11:
\[ 121 \div 11 = 11 \]
So, we can write:
\[ 121 = 11 \times 11 \]
Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:
\[ 242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11 \]

Now, we can simplify \(\sqrt{242}\) using the prime factorization:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} \]
Since the square root of a product is the product of the square roots, we can rewrite this as:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} \]
Since \(\sqrt{11 \times 11} = 11\), we have:
\[ \sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 \]
Therefore, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:
\[ \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2} \]

The final answer is:

" first, we need to consider the constraint that Pierre, Lisa, and Thomas must sit together. We can treat them as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a circular table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 ""people"" to arrange, so the number of ways to arrange them is:
\[
(6-1)! = 5! = 120
\]

Next, we need to consider the internal arrangement of Pierre, Lisa, and Thomas within their block. There are 3 people in the block, and they can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways:
\[
3! = 6
\]

To find the total number of ways to arrange all 8 people such that Pierre, Lisa, and Thomas sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 ""people"" by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Lisa, and Thomas within their block:
\[
120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Lisa, and Thomas sit together is:

"为了 find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 10^2 x^{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6}

\[

\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)
\]
\[
= 10 \cdot 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}

Now, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[

Finally, we reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"要确定正五边形围绕其中心旋转时，与原位置第一次重合的最小角度，我们需要理解正五边形的对称性。正五边形有5条相等的边和5条相等的角。这意味着当它围绕其中心旋转时，它在旋转一个等于其内角总和除以边数的分数时，会与自身重合。

正五边形的内角总和由以下公式给出：
\[

由于正五边形有5条边，因此与自身重合的最小旋转角度是：
\[

\]
然而，这个角度是内角，而不是旋转角度。旋转角度是正五边形每条边在中心处形成的角，即：

" given the coordinates of a parallelogram as \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) with \(x > 7\), we need to find the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):

\[
\text{Midpoint} = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This midpoint must also be the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\). Therefore, we can set up the following equations for the coordinates of the midpoint:

\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two separate equations:

1. \(\frac{6+x}{2} = 6\)
2. \(\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5\)

Let's solve the first equation for \(x\):

\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]

Multiply both sides by 2:

\[
6 + x = 12
\]

Subtract 6 from both sides:

\[
x = 6

"为了 find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

This equation has solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, we have \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):

"为了找到满足不等式

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

对于所有 2次원 vector \(\bold{v}\) 的最小正实数 \(C\)，我们需要确定矩阵 \(A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix}\) 的 operator norm。矩阵 \(A\) 的 operator norm 定义为

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

首先，我们计算 \(A \bold{v}\) 对于 \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\)：

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

接下来，我们找到 \(A \bold{v}\) 的大小：

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

我们需要在约束 \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\) 下，即 \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) 的条件下，最大化 \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\)。为此，我们使用拉格朗日乘数法。定义函数

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

和约束

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

梯度为

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y) \quad \text{和} \quad \nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

设置 \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\)，我们得到方程组

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

从第一个方程，我们有

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

从第二个方程，我们有

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

将两个 \(\lambda\) 的表达式相等，我们得到

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

通过乘以 \(xy\) 来清除分母，我们得到

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy.
\]

重新排列项，我们得到

\[
2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

这是一个关于 \(y\) 的二次方程。使用二次公式 \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) 其中 \(a = 2\), \(b = -3x\), 和 \(c = -2x^2\)，我们得到

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

这给我们两个解：

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{和} \quad y = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

我们将这些解代入约束 \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\)。

1. 对于 \(y = 2x\)：

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \quad y = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

将 \(x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\) 和 \(y = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\) 代入 \(f(x, y)\)，我们得到

\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right) = 4\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right) + 13\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. 对于 \(y = -\frac{x}{2}\):

\[
x^2 + \left(-\frac{x}{2}\right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \quad y = \mp \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

将 \(x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\) 和 \(y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\) 代入 \(f(x, y)\)，我们得到

\[
f\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right) = 4\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\right)\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right) + 13\left(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

\(f(x, y)\) 的最大值是 16，因此 \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\|\) 的最大值是 \(\sqrt{16} = 4\)。因此，最小正实数 \(C\) 是

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To determine how many trouts weigh the same as one square, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- \( t \) represents the weight of one trout.
- \( s \) represents the weight of one square.
- \( b \) represents the weight of one fish.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Three squares and one fish weigh the same as three trouts:
   \[
   3s + b = 3t
   \]
2. Two trouts and one fish weigh the same as one square:
   \[
   2t + b = s
   \]

We need to solve this system of equations to find the relationship between \( t \) and \( s \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( b \):
\[
b = s - 2t
\]

Next, substitute \( b = s - 2t \) into the first equation:
\[
3s + (s - 2t) = 3t
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
3s + s - 2t = 3t
\]
\[
4s - 2t = 3t
\]

Add \( 2t \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( s \):
\[
4s = 5t
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( s \):
\[
s = \frac{5t}{4}

This equation tells us that one square weighs \(\frac{5}{4}\) times the weight of one trout. To find out how many trouts weigh the same as one square, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{5}{4}\):
\[

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3

\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2

\[

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[
a \cdot bt = abt

\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a

\[

\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[

This is always true and does not provide new information.

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):

Solving for \(b\):
\[

\[

\[

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[

Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[

\[

\[

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per second and that the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per second. We need to find the radius \( r \).

First, we take the derivative of the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):

"为了确定$y = f(x)$的图形与每个水平线至少 once intersecting的$a$的最大值，我们需要 analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \( x \geq a \):**
   \[
   f(x) = ax^2
   \]
   This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \). If \( a = 0 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \geq 0 \), which is a horizontal line.

2. **For \( x < a \):**
   \[
   f(x) = ax + 2a
   \]
   This is a linear function with slope \( a \). If \( a > 0 \), the function is increasing. If \( a < 0 \), the function is decreasing. If \( a = 0 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x < 0 \), which is a horizontal line.

To ensure that the graph of \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of \( f(x) \) in both pieces.

### Case 1: \( a > 0 \)
- For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \). As \( x \) increases from \( a \) to \( \infty \), \( f(x) \) increases from \( a^3 \) to \( \infty \).
- For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). As \( x \) decreases from \( a \) to \( -\infty \), \( f(x) \) decreases from \( a^2 + 2a \) to \( -\infty \).

For \( y = f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line, the range of \( f(x) \) must cover all real numbers. This means:
\[
a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a

### Solving the inequality \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \)
\[
a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0
\]
Factor out \( a \):
\[
a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0

Factor the quadratic:
\[

We solve this inequality by finding the roots and testing intervals:
- Roots: \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), \( a = -1 \)

The intervals to test are: \( (-\infty, -1) \), \( (-1, 0) \), \( (0, 2) \), and \( (2, \infty) \).

- For \( a \in (-\infty, -1) \), choose \( a = -2 \):
  \[

- For \( a \in (0, 2) \), choose \( a = 1 \):
  \[
  (1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \quad (\text{negative})

  (3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \quad (\text{positive})

The inequality \( a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0 \) holds in the intervals \( (-\infty, -1] \) and \( [0, 2] \).

### Case 2: \( a < 0 \)
- For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \). As \( x \) increases from \( a \) to \( \infty \), \( f(x) \) decreases from \( a^3 \) to \( 0 \).
- For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). As \( x \) decreases from \( a \) to \( -\infty \), \( f(x) \) decreases from \( a^2 + 2a \) to \( \infty \).

For \( y = f(x) \) to intersect every horizontal line, the range of \( f(x) \) must cover all real numbers. This means:
\[
a^2 + 2a \geq 0
\]

### Solving the inequality \( a^2 + 2a \geq 0 \)
\[
a(a + 2) \geq 0
\]

We solve this inequality by finding the roots and testing intervals:
- Roots: \( a = 0 \), \( a = -2 \)

The intervals to test are: \( (-\infty, -2) \), \( (-2, 0) \), and \( (0, \infty) \).

- For \( a \in (-\infty, -2) \), choose \( a = -3 \):
  \[
  (-3)(-3 + 2) = (-3)(-1) = 3 \quad (\text{positive})
  \]

- For \( a \in (-2, 0) \), choose \( a = -1 \):
  \[
  (-1)(-1 + 2) = (-1)(1) = -1 \quad (\text{negative})
  \]

- For \( a \in (0, \infty) \), choose \( a = 1 \):
  \[
  (1)(1 + 2) = (1)(3) = 3 \quad (\text{positive})
  \]

The inequality \( a(a + 2) \geq 0 \) holds in the intervals \( (-\infty, -2] \) and \( [0, \infty) \).

### Conclusion
Combining the results from both cases, the values of \( a \) that ensure \( y = f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once are:
\[
(-\infty, -1] \cup [0, 2]
\]

The maximum value of \( a \) in this range is \( 2 \).

首先，我们对 \(x\) 和 \(y\) 的项完成平方。

从 \(x\) 的项开始：
\[x^2 - 10x\]

接下来，对于 \(y\) 的项：
\[y^2 + 6y\]
为了完成平方，我们取 \(y\) 的系数的一半，即 \(6\)，除以 2 得到 \(3\)，然后平方得到 \(9\)。因此，我们可以将 \(y^2 + 6y\) 重写为：
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9\]

现在，将这些完成的平方代回原方程：

x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution where \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for a solution where \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find another root of the cubic equation that is not \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By the properties of quadratic and cubic equations, if \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a root, then the other roots must satisfy the equation. By symmetry and the nature of the function, we can test specific values of \(\lambda\) to find a solution. Let's test \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
Then,
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2).
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x \implies -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or the roots of the cubic equation \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). By testing, we find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root:
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.
\]
Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\), which is not a solution to \(f(x) \neq x\). However, we need to check other values of \(\lambda\) to find the correct value.

By further analysis, we find that the correct value is \(\lambda = 3\). Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is:

"To solve for the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) that satisfies the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) to rewrite the expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ,

\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ.

Substituting these back into the expression for \(\tan \theta\), we get:
\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ella,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""l"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""e"" and ""a"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ella"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 4.
- The frequency of ""l"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""e"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""a"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{4!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[

For $42!$ and the prime number 5, we calculate:

First, we calculate each term:

\[

"为了 find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Similarly, if \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
For \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), we have:
\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]
For \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \), we have:
\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1.

Expanding this determinant, we get:

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through \(G\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the vertices to the centroid \(G\), which is \(2:3\). Therefore, the ratio of the side lengths of \(\triangle AMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(2:3\).

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths. Thus, the ratio of the area of \(\triangle AMN\) to the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is \((2:3)^2 = 4:9\). Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is:

First, we list all the divisors of 24:
\[1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.\]
Since we are looking for $n > 1$, we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:

" let's define the variables first:
- Let \( x \) be the number of 10-cent coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of 5-cent coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 11.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of equations:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 10x + 5y = 75 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2x + y = 15 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( x + y = 11 \)
2. \( 2x + y = 15 \)

Next, we can eliminate \( y \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2x + y) - (x + y) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2x + y - x - y = 4 \]
\[ x = 4 \]

Now that we know \( x = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( y \):
\[ 4 + y = 11 \]
\[ y = 11 - 4 \]
\[ y = 7 \]

" first, we identify the first six prime numbers, which are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we need to determine the conditions under which the sum of two numbers is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the probability of each scenario:

1. **Both numbers are even:**
   - There is only one even number, so the probability of picking an even number for the first selection is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
   - Similarly, the probability of picking an even number for the second selection is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
   - Therefore, the probability of both numbers being even is \(\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}\).

2. **Both numbers are odd:**
   - There are five odd numbers, so the probability of picking an odd number for the first selection is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
   - Similarly, the probability of picking an odd number for the second selection is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
   - Therefore, the probability of both numbers being odd is \(\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}\).

2. Triangle B with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

First, let's calculate the area of Triangle A. The base of Triangle A is 2 units (from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 2\)) and the height is 4 units (from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 4\)). The area of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[

Substituting the values for Triangle A:
\[
\text{Area of Triangle A} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

Next, let's calculate the area of Triangle B. The base of Triangle B is 3 units (from \(x = 0\) to \(x = 3\)) and the height is 4 units (from \(y = 0\) to \(y = 4\)). Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area of Triangle B} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}

The total area of the shaded portion is the sum of the areas of Triangle A and Triangle B:

"要 find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the properties of 450. The number 450 can be factored into prime factors as follows:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's analyze each condition:

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0. Therefore, the last digit of our number must be 0.

2. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are either 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since our number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last two digits must be 00.

3. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since our number consists only of the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits is simply the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, the number of 1's must be a multiple of 9.

Combining these conditions, we need to find the smallest number that ends in 00 and has a number of 1's that is a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is 11111111100, which has 9 ones and ends in 00.

   - The wheel has numbers from 1 to 6.
   - We are interested in the numbers that leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4.
   - The numbers that satisfy this condition are 1 and 5.
   - Therefore, there are 2 possible outcomes for the first number.

2. **Determine the possible outcomes for the second number:**
   - The second number is determined by the result of the second spin of the wheel.
   - The wheel has numbers from 1 to 6.

" first, we need to simplify the given fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) into a decimal. To do this, we can rewrite the denominator in terms of powers of 10. Notice that:

\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000.\]

So the fraction becomes:

\[\frac{4321}{20000000}.\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

- \(\theta\) represents the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) represents the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that every point on the surface has the same \(z\)-coordinate. In other words, the surface is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and is located at a distance \(c\) above it.

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

3. Expand \( 623(x + 5) \):
\[

\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[

Multiplying both sides by \(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ\), we get:

Rearranging terms, we have:

\[

Rearranging further, we get:

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can factor it as:

\[
(\tan 20^\circ - \sqrt{3})(\tan^2 20^\circ + (1 - \sqrt{3})\tan 20^\circ + 1) = 0
\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ \neq \sqrt{3}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + (1 - \sqrt{3})\tan 20^\circ + 1 = 0

We use the identity \(\tan 40^\circ = \tan(3 \cdot 20^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan(60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3}\tan 20^\circ}\). We also use the identity \(\tan 10^\circ = \tan(60^\circ - 50^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 50^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 50^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 50^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3}\tan 50^\circ}\).

Using the identity \(\tan 50^\circ = \cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 10^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}}{1 + \sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}\tan 40^\circ - 1}{\tan 40^\circ + \sqrt{3}}

We use the identity \(\tan 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 80^\circ}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\tan 80^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}\tan 40^\circ - 1}{\tan 40^\circ + \sqrt{3}}
\]

This implies:

\[
\tan 80^\circ = \frac{\tan 40^\circ + \sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}\tan 40^\circ - 1}

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2)^\circ
\]

Let the measure of the excluded interior angle be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
180(n-2) - x = 1070
\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 180(n-2) - 1070
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must satisfy the inequality \(0 < x < 180^\circ\). Substituting the expression for \(x\) into this inequality, we have:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

We will solve this compound inequality in two parts. First, solve \(0 < 180(n-2) - 1070\):

\[
1070 < 180(n-2)
\]

Divide both sides by 180:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{107}{18} < n-2
\]

Convert \(\frac{107}{18}\) to a decimal:

\[
5.9444\ldots < n-2
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
7.9444\ldots < n
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \geq 8
\]

Next, solve \(180(n-2) - 1070 < 180\):

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]

Divide both sides by 180:

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
n-2 < \frac{125}{18}
\]

Convert \(\frac{125}{18}\) to a decimal:

\[
n-2 < 6.9444\ldots
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
n < 8.9444\ldots
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \leq 8
\]

Combining the two parts of the inequality, we get:

\[
8 \leq n \leq 8
\]

Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8. Thus, the polygon has \(\boxed{8}\) sides.","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[
(t+2)t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]
We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
So, \( x = 5 \) or \( x = -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two potential solutions for \( t \):
\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4
\]
\[
t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
t = -1 + 18 = 17
\]
\[
t = -1 - 18 = -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
So, the possible solutions are \( t = 4 \) and \( t = 17 \). Since we are asked to find the unique odd integer, we have:
\[
t = 17
\]
To verify, we check that \( t+2 = 19 \) is indeed the modular inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23:
\[
17 \cdot 19 = 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

"要 find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube in feet:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we have:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = 1 \text{ foot}

2. **Calculate the surface area of the cube in square feet:**
   The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[

   Substituting the side length \( s = 1 \) foot, we get:
   \[
   A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Convert the surface area from square feet to square inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, to convert 6 square feet to square inches, we multiply by 144:
   \[
   6 \text{ square feet} \times 144 \text{ square inches per square foot} = 864 \text{ square inches}

"要找到 \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) 的数와 其近号公轭的乘积，我们首先需要确定 \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) 的近号公轭。一个数 \(a + \sqrt{b}\) 的近号公轭是 \(a - \sqrt{b}\)。因此，\(5 + \sqrt{3}\) 的近号公轭是 \(5 - \sqrt{3}\)。

接下来，我们需要计算这两个数的乘积：
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

\[

Substituting \( x = 5 \) into the function, we get:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we need to find \( f(5) - 1 \). Since we already know that \( f(5) = 7 \), we have:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

\[

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

However, we know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\). Therefore, the equation \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is a contradiction. This means there are no values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

"To find the distance between two parallel lines given by the parametric equations:
\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.
\]
Using the determinant formula for the cross product, we get:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
Simplifying each component, we have:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of integer coordinate points that lie strictly inside the rectangle with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[

This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:

This means \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible integer values for \(y\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[

\]

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a},
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}).
\]

We can factor out the scalar multiples of the cross products:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these vectors into the expression, we have:

\[

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

3. Sum the total costs from all countries.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average cost.

Let's start with the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s:
- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

Next, we calculate the total cost of the stamps from each country:
- Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cents/stamp} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
- France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents/stamp} = 48 \text{ cents}\)
- Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cents/stamp} = 24 \text{ cents}\)
- Spain: \(13 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ cents/stamp} = 65 \text{ cents}\)

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(AC\) as the hypotenuse and \(CD\) as one of the legs. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

To find \(d\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\), and the areas of these triangles are proportional to their bases \(BC\) and \(CD\). Therefore,
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{CD} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

Using the proportionality, we have:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h}{\frac{1}{2} \times c \times h} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

Since the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are proportional to their bases, we can write:
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = [ABCD]
\]

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we need to find the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are in the ratio \(b : c\). Let \(k\) be the ratio such that:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = k \times [\triangle ACD]
\]

Then,
\[
k \times [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]
\[
(k + 1) \times [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
d^2 = c^2 + h^2
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = [\triangle ACD]
\]

Thus,
\[
\frac{b}{c} = 1
\]

Therefore,
\[
b = c

Finally, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c^2

   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}
   \]
   Simplify inside the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{19} \cdot \frac{19}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}\). So, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \times 21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{70 \times 21}{30}\) by canceling out the common factors. Notice that \(70\) and \(30\) have a common factor of \(10\):

\[
\frac{70 \times 21}{30} = \frac{(10 \times 7) \times 21}{10 \times 3} = \frac{7 \times 21}{3}
\]

Now, we calculate \(7 \times 21\):

\[
7 \times 21 = 147

So, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{147}{3}

We can simplify \(\frac{147}{3}\) by dividing \(147\) by \(3\):

\[

"要 determine the probability that two randomly chosen line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) on a circle intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the relative positions of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A circle has a continuous circumference.
   - Four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen independently and uniformly at random on the circle.
   - We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Condition for Intersection:**
   - Two line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged such that one pair of points (e.g., \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (e.g., \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

3. **Counting Arrangements:**
   - Consider the four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) arranged in a clockwise order around the circle. There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange these four points:
     \[
     4! = 24
     \]
   - However, since the circle is symmetric, any arrangement can be rotated to match another arrangement. Therefore, we need to consider the distinct arrangements up to rotation. There are \(4\) possible rotations for each arrangement, so we divide by \(4\):
     \[
     \frac{24}{4} = 6
     \]
   - Thus, there are \(6\) distinct ways to arrange the four points around the circle.

4. **Identifying Intersecting Arrangements:**
   - For \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged such that \(A\) and \(B\) are separated by \(C\) and \(D\). This can happen in two specific ways:
     - \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) (or any cyclic permutation of this arrangement)
     - \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\) (or any cyclic permutation of this arrangement)
   - Each of these arrangements can be rotated to match another arrangement, so we divide by \(4\) for each:
     \[
     \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]
   - Therefore, there are \(2\) distinct intersecting arrangements out of the \(6\) distinct arrangements.

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the ratio of the number of intersecting arrangements to the total number of distinct arrangements:
     \[
     \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
     \]

Thus, the probability that two randomly chosen line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) on a circle intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the given information about the shaded region.

The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two sectors:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
\]

We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{5}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

To convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees, we use the conversion factor \(\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180^\circ}{3} = 120^\circ

"要 determine how many cylindrical mugs are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical mug and the spherical tank and then find out how many times the volume of the mug fits into the volume of the tank.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mug. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the mug fits into the volume of the tank. We do this by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[ \text{Number of mugs} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for sine. Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). Then the expression becomes \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = (0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - (\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a committee consisting of 8 public party members and 6 private party members, with the condition that at least one member from each party must be included, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee without any restrictions and then subtracting the number of ways to form the subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., the subcommittee consists of only public party members or only private party members).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from the 14 members (8 public party members and 6 private party members). This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is:

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that consists only of public party members. Since there are 8 public party members, the number of ways to choose 5 members from 8 is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that consists only of private party members. Since there are 6 private party members, the number of ways to choose 5 members from 6 is:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., the subcommittee consists of only public party members or only private party members) is the sum of the two cases calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee to get the number of ways to form a subcommittee that includes at least one member from each party:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that includes at least one member from each party is:

"设三个连续整数分别为 \( n-1 \), \( n \), 和 \( n+1 \). According to the problem, their product is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[

\]

We also know that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, we can write the second equation as:

\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten using the difference of squares:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[
n^2 = 25

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

This satisfies the original equation. The largest of these integers is 6.

If \( n = -5 \), the three consecutive integers are -6, -5, and -4. Their product is:

\[

This does not satisfy the original equation. Therefore, the only valid solution is \( n = 5 \).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) where \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). This polynomial can be derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{\text{constant term}}{\text{leading coefficient}} = \frac{1}{8}\). However, this product includes all five roots of the polynomial \(8x^5 - 1 = 0\) except \(x = 1\), so we need to divide by \(\cos \left( \frac{0 \cdot 2\pi}{15} \right) = 1\). Therefore, the product of the roots \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{8}\).

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\), we have:

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines:

\]

Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
x^2 = \frac{1 - (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))}{1 + (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)}{1 + 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{(1 + \cos(\theta))(1 - 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2\cos(\theta) - 1)}{(1 - \cos(\theta))(1 + 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2\cos(\theta) - 1)}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{(1 + \cos(\theta))(2\cos(\theta) - 2\cos^2(\theta))}{(1 - \cos(\theta))(2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^2(\theta))}
\]
\[
x^2 = \frac{2\cos(\theta)(1 + \cos(\theta))(1 - \cos(\theta))}{2\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos(\theta))(1 + \cos(\theta))} = 1
\]
\[

\]

Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 2\).

Next, we find the length of \(AB\). Using the Pythagorean theorem in triangle \(ABM\):
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + 1^2 = 121 + 1 = 122
\]
\[
AB = \sqrt{122}
\]

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 consecutive integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). Since there are 27 terms in the sequence, the median is the 14th term (the middle term). The 14th term is:
\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81
\]
Therefore, the median of the 27 consecutive integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts and solve each part separately.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), the expression \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic inequality in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(0 \leq y < 3\), which means \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
 our goal is to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine which学 year has the male student bus users closest to 135% of the female student bus users, we need to calculate the ratio of male to female bus users for each学 year and compare it to 1.35.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus users for each学 year:

1. **9th学年:**
   - Male bus users: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Female bus users: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.042\)

2. **10th学年:**
   - Male bus users: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Female bus users: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.040\)

3. **11th学年:**
   - Male bus users: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Female bus users: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

   - Female bus users: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the roots of the numerator and the denominator, which are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-10)^2 - 36(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-1)^2 - 36(-1) = 1 + 36 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 1^2 - 36(1) = 1 - 36 = -35.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 10^2 - 36(10) = 100 - 360 = -260.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 37^2 - 36(37) = 1369 - 1332 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To find the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the variables. Let the length of the field be \( L \) meters and the width be \( W \) meters. The track consists of two straight sides of length \( L \) and two semicircles with radius \( W \). The total length of the track is given as 400 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation for the perimeter of the track as:

\[ 2L + 2\pi W = 400 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:

\[ L + \pi W = 200 \]

Next, we solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):

\[ L = 200 - \pi W \]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width:

\[ A = L \cdot W \]

Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:

\[ A = (200 - \pi W)W \]
\[ A = 200W - \pi W^2 \]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( W \), and it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). In our equation, \( a = -\pi \) and \( b = 200 \). Therefore, the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area is:

\[ W = -\frac{200}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{200}{2\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):

\[ L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100 \]

The maximum area \( A \) is then:

\[ A = L \cdot W = 100 \cdot \frac{100}{\pi} = \frac{10000}{\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum possible area of the field is:

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[

\[
ST = 2

\[

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \( d \), we minimize \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). First, find the derivative \( f'(x) \):

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Since \((- \sqrt{2})^4 = 4\) and \((- \sqrt{2})^2 = 2\), we have:

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that the shortest distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we identify \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]

\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]

\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"To solve for the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the cube, we start by placing the cube in a coordinate system. Let the vertices of the cube be \( A = (1,0,0) \), \( B = (-1,0,0) \), \( C = (0,1,0) \), \( D = (0,-1,0) \), \( E = (0,0,1) \), and \( F = (0,0,-1) \). We are given the distances from \( P \) to these vertices as follows: \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), \( PE = 11 \), and we need to find \( PF \).

Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \). The distance from \( P \) to each vertex can be expressed using the distance formula:
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
PC = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
PD = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

We start by squaring each of these equations:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 = PF^2
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Now, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
2x - 2y = 55
\]
\[
x - y = \frac{55}{2}
\]
Since \( x = 10 \), we substitute to find \( y \):
\[
10 - y = \frac{55}{2}
\]
\[
-y = \frac{55}{2} - 10
\]
\[
-y = \frac{55}{2} - \frac{20}{2}
\]
\[
-y = \frac{35}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{35}{2}
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 = 72
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 - y^2 = 72
\]
\[
2x + 2y = 72
\]
\[
x + y = 36
\]
Since \( x = 10 \), we substitute to find \( y \):
\[
10 + y = 36
\]
\[
y = 26
\]
This contradicts our earlier value of \( y = -\frac{35}{2} \). Therefore, we need to re-equality the values of \( y \) and \( z \) and recheck the values of \( y \) and \( z \).

Finally we find the value of \( PF \) using the correct value of \( y and z) we find the value of \( PF \) using the correct value of \( y and z) we find the value of \( PF \) using the correct value

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration. According to the problem, Jason exerts the same force on both the baseball and the softball. Let's denote the force by \( F \), the mass of the baseball by \( m_b \), the mass of the softball by \( m_s \), the acceleration of the baseball by \( a_b \), and the acceleration of the softball by \( a_s \). We are given that \( m_b = 150 \) g and \( m_s = 200 \) g. Since the force is the same for both balls, we can write:

\[ F = m_b a_b = m_s a_s \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 150 a_b = 200 a_s \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the baseball to the acceleration of the softball, we solve for \( \frac{a_b}{a_s} \):

\[ \frac{a_b}{a_s} = \frac{200}{150} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{a_b}{a_s} = \frac{200 \div 50}{150 \div 50} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jason's ball to the acceleration ofimeter's ball is:

" first, we need to convert the decimal number \(629_{10}\) to its 7进法 and 8进法 representations.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) has the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) has the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Each of these digits appears exactly once in both representations.

Therefore, the number of common digits is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the total number of negative relationships (or ""hatakes"") in the group, we need to consider the interactions between the fairies and the sorcerers. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of fairies and sorcerers:**
   - There are 5 fairies.
   - There are 10 sorcerers.

2. **Determine the relationship between fairies and sorcerers:**
   - Each fairy has a negative relationship with each sorcerer.
   - Therefore, each fairy will have 10 negative relationships (one with each sorcerer).

3. **Calculate the total number of negative relationships from the fairies' perspective:**
   - Since there are 5 fairies, and each fairy has 10 negative relationships, the total number of negative relationships from the fairies' perspective is:
     \[
     5 \times 10 = 50
     \]

4. **Consider the relationship from the sorcerers' perspective:**
   - Each sorcerer has a negative relationship with each fairy.
   - Therefore, each sorcerer will also have 5 negative relationships (one with each fairy).

5. **Calculate the total number of negative relationships from the sorcerers' perspective:**
   - Since there are 10 sorcerers, and each sorcerer has 5 negative relationships, the total number of negative relationships from the sorcerers' perspective is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]

6. **Combine the total number of negative relationships from both perspectives:**
   - The total number of negative relationships in the group is the sum of the negative relationships from the fairies' perspective and the sorcerers' perspective. However, since each negative relationship is counted twice (once from each participant's perspective), we need to divide by 2 to avoid double-counting:
     \[
     \frac{50 + 50}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50

Therefore, the total number of negative relationships in the group is \(\boxed{50}\).","[50, '50']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"为了 find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

" point \((6, 0)\)到直线 \(y = 2x - 2\) until the shortest distance is found. The shortest distance from a point to a line is the perpendicular distance.

First, we need the slope of the given line \(y = 2x - 2\). The slope \(m_1\) is 2.

The slope of a line perpendicular to this line will be the negative reciprocal of \(m_1\). Therefore, the slope \(m_2\) of the perpendicular line is:
\[
m_2 = -\frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line to find the equation of the line passing through the point \((6, 0)\) with slope \(-\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
y - y_1 = m_2(x - x_1)
\]
Substituting \(x_1 = 6\), \(y_1 = 0\), and \(m_2 = -\frac{1}{2}\):
\[
y - 0 = -\frac{1}{2}(x - 6)
\]
\[
y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
\]

Now, we need to find the intersection point of the two lines \(y = 2x - 2\) and \(y = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3\). Set the equations equal to each other:
\[
2x - 2 = -\frac{1}{2}x + 3
\]

To solve for \(x\), first eliminate the fraction by multiplying every term by 2:
\[
4x - 4 = -x + 6
\]

Next, add \(x\) to both sides:
\[
5x - 4 = 6
\]

Then, add 4 to both sides:
\[
5x = 10
\]

Finally, divide by 5:
\[
x = 2
\]

Substitute \(x = 2\) back into the equation \(y = 2x - 2\) to find the corresponding \(y\)-coordinate:
\[
y = 2(2) - 2
\]
\[
y = 4 - 2
\]
\[
y = 2
\]

The intersection point is \((2, 2)\).

Now, we calculate the distance between the point \((6, 0)\) and the point \((2, 2)\) using the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting \(x_1 = 6\), \(y_1 = 0\), \(x_2 = 2\), and \(y_2 = 2\):
\[
d = \sqrt{(2 - 6)^2 + (2 - 0)^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{(-4)^2 + 2^2}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{16 + 4}
\]
\[
d = \sqrt{20}
\]
\[
d = 2\sqrt{5}

Thus, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

" first, we need to find the roots of the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\). We start by using the substitution \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\). This substitution is useful because it can simplify the polynomial. First, we express \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2\) in terms of \(y\).

Multiply both sides of \(y = x + \frac{1}{x}\) by \(x^2\):
\[x^3 + x = yx^2.\]
Now, square both sides:
\[(x^3 + x)^2 = (yx^2)^2,\]
which simplifies to:
\[x^6 + 2x^4 + x^2 = y^2x^4.\]
Rearrange the terms to form a polynomial in \(x^2\):
\[x^6 - (y^2 - 2)x^4 + x^2 = 0.\]
Factor out \(x^2\):
\[x^2(x^4 - (y^2 - 2)x^2 + 1) = 0.\]
Since \(x \neq 0\) (because \(x = 0\) is not a root of the original polynomial), we have:
\[x^4 - (y^2 - 2)x^2 + 1 = 0.\]
Let \(z = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in \(z\):
\[z^2 - (y^2 - 2)z + 1 = 0.\]
Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -(y^2 - 2)\), and \(c = 1\):
\[z = \frac{(y^2 - 2) \pm \sqrt{(y^2 - 2)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{(y^2 - 2) \pm \sqrt{y^4 - 4y^2 + 4 - 4}}{2} = \frac{(y^2 - 2) \pm \sqrt{y^4 - 4y^2}}{2} = \frac{(y^2 - 2) \pm y^2 - 2}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(z\):
\[z = \frac{(y^2 - 2) + (y^2 - 2)}{2} = y^2 - 2,\]
\[z = \frac{(y^2 - 2) - (y^2 - 2)}{2} = 0.\]
Since \(z = x^2\) and \(x \neq 0\), we have \(x^2 = y^2 - 2\). Therefore, \(y = \pm \sqrt{x^2 + 2}\). However, we need to find the roots of the original polynomial, so we need to solve \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) directly.

We can use the fact that the roots of the polynomial are symmetric and can be expressed in terms of complex numbers. Let's assume the roots are \(x = re^{i\theta}\). By symmetry and the nature of the polynomial, the roots are likely to be of the form \(x = \pm \sqrt[4]{-2}\). We can write:
\[x = \sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4}, \quad x = \sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}, \quad x = -\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4}, \quad x = -\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}.\]
Let \(\alpha_1 = \sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4}\), \(\alpha_2 = \sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}\), \(\alpha_3 = -\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4}\), and \(\alpha_4 = -\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}\).

Now, we need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\):
\[\alpha_1\alpha_2 = (\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4})(\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}) = \sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4 - i\pi/4} = \sqrt{2},\]
\[\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (-\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4})(-\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}) = \sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4 + i\pi/4} = \sqrt{2},\]
\[\alpha_1\alpha_3 = (\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4})(-\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4}) = -\sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4 + i\pi/4} = -\sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/2} = -\sqrt{2} i,\]
\[\alpha_2\alpha_4 = (\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4})(-\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}) = -\sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4 - i\pi/4} = -\sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/2} = \sqrt{2} i,\]
\[\alpha_1\alpha_4 = (\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4})(-\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4}) = -\sqrt{2} e^{i\pi/4 - i\pi/4} = -\sqrt{2},\]
\[\alpha_2\alpha_3 = (\sqrt[4]{2} e^{-i\pi/4})(-\sqrt[4]{2} e^{i\pi/4}) = -\sqrt{2} e^{-i\pi/4 + i\pi/4} = -\sqrt{2}.\]
Therefore, the values are:
\[\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \sqrt{2} + \sqrt{2} = 2\sqrt{2},\]
\[\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = -\sqrt{2} i + \sqrt{2} i = 0,\]
\[\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = -\sqrt{2} - \sqrt{2} = -2\sqrt{2}.\]

"Let's define the cost of one pencil as \( p \) dollars and the cost of one eraser as \( e \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. The cost of three pencils and one eraser is $1.24:

   3p + e = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five pencils and one eraser is $1.82:
   \[
   5p + e = 1.82

To eliminate \( e \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2p = 0.58

To find the value of \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[

"要确定\(\frac{137}{500}\)的 소数 transposition中 소数点 오른쪽에 있는 最后 0 non-zero数字, we first convert the fraction to its decimal form.

We start by performing the division \(137 \div 500\):

1. \(500\) goes into \(1370\) two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)), so we write down \(0.2\) and subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\), leaving a remainder of \(370\).
2. Bring down a \(0\) to make it \(3700\). \(500\) goes into \(3700\) seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)), so we write down \(7\) and subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\), leaving a remainder of \(200\).
3. Bring down a \(0\) to make it \(2000\). \(500\) goes into \(2000\) four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)), so we write down \(4\) and subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\), leaving a remainder of \(0\).

Thus, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

In the decimal \(0.274\), the digits after the decimal point are \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\). The last non-zero digit is \(4\).

Therefore, the last non-zero digit in the decimal transposition of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The condition that a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed using the Euclidean distance formula. Specifically, we need:

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + y^2}, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{x^2 + (y-b)^2}, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x+a)^2 + y^2}, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{x^2 + (y+b)^2}, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x+a)^2 + (y+b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides of each inequality, we get:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x-a)^2 + y^2 \implies x^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 \implies 2ax < a^2 \implies x < \frac{a}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + (y-b)^2 \implies y^2 < y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2by + b^2 \implies 2by < b^2 \implies y < \frac{b}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x+a)^2 + y^2 \implies x^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 \implies -2ax < a^2 \implies x > -\frac{a}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + (y+b)^2 \implies y^2 < y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2by + b^2 \implies -2by < b^2 \implies y > -\frac{b}{2}
\]

\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x+a)^2 + (y+b)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Combining these inequalities, we find that the region where a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is a square with vertices at \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), and \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\). The area of this square is:

\[
\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = a \cdot b
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

\[
2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:

\[
\frac{\text{Area of the square}}{\text{Area of the rectangle}} = \frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}

Here, 9 is the quotient. To find the remainder, we multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract the result from the original number:

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents remain after the four friends convert their money into dollars and cents and then exchange the cents for dimes, we need to follow these steps:

   - Lee: \$27.47
   -莎莉: \$35.23
   - 준: \$37.37
   - 코尼: \$26.52

2. **Sum the total amounts:**
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.59.

3. **Convert the total amount into dollars and cents:**
   - Dollars: \$126
   - Cents: 59 cents

4. **Convert the cents into dimes:**
   - Each dime is worth \$0.10.
   - To find out how many dimes can be made from 59 cents, we divide 59 by 10:
     \[
     59 \div 10 = 5.9
     \]
   - Since we can only have whole dimes, we take the integer part of the division:
     \[
     5 \text{ dimes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining cents after converting to dimes:**
   - The value of 5 dimes is:
     \[
     5 \times 0.10 = 0.50 \text{ dollars} = 50 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Subtract the value of the dimes from the total cents:
     \[
     59 - 50 = 9 \text{ cents}

"为了 find the average score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score. We do this by multiplying the number of students who received each score by the score itself, and then summing these products.

- The total score for the 20 students who received 80 points is:
  \[
  20 \times 80 = 1600

- The total score for the 8 students who received 90 points is:

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total score for the entire class:
\[
1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The first row is:
\[
(7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15

The second row is:
\[

\]

The third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

The first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The main diagonal is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The other diagonal is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how much farther玛� than$"" does walk compared to Jung, we need to calculate the distances each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jung travels. Jung walks along the length and width of the rectangular field. The field has a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet. Therefore, the total distance Jung travels is:
\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Next, let's calculate the distance Jung travels. Jung walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field). So, the length of the diagonal \(d\) is:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
400^2 = 160000 \quad \text{and} \quad 300^2 = 90000
\]
Adding these together, we get:
\[
160000 + 90000 = 250000
\]
Taking the square root of 250000, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Jung and Jung:
\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

Therefore, Jung travels \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Jung.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
" given that \(\omega\) is a complex number satisfying \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity.

They also satisfy the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the equation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\) and the fact that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we get:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
