"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that three specific people (Pierre, Rza, and Tomas) sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the three specific people as a single ""block"":** Since Pierre, Rza, and Tomas must sit next to each other, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rza-Tomatoes block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:** The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the people within the block:** Within the Pierre-Rza-Tomatoes block, Pierre, Rza, and Tomas can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 positions to fill and 3 people to fill them, so the number of arrangements is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results:** To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rza, and Tomas sit next to each other, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange the people within the block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rza, and Tomas sit next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"为了找到 \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) 的展开式中的常数项，我们将使用二项式定理。二项式定理表明：

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

在我们的情况下，\(a = 10x^3\)，\(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\)，且 \(n = 5\)。我们需要找到展开式中 \(x\) 的幂为零的项，即常数项。

展开式中的通项由下式给出：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

首先，我们简化每一部分：

1. \((10x^3)^{5-k}\)：
\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

2. \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\)：
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

将这些结果结合起来，通项变为：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

合并 \(x\) 的幂：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k}
\]

为了使 \(T_k\) 成为常数项，\(x\) 的指数必须为零：

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

解 \(k\)：

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

现在，我们将 \(k = 3\) 代回通项中，以找到常数项：

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3}
\]

计算每一部分：

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100
\]

\[
(-1)^3 = -1
\]

\[
\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}

将这些结果结合起来：

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{8} = 1000 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{8} = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, the expression becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Now, we need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

Thus, \( 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Therefore, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is:

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry can be calculated by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that the pentagon will look the same after being rotated by 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and 360 degrees. The smallest positive angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position is 72 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"Given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), and the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) with \(x > 7\), we need to find the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we set this equal to the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\) is satisfied, we find \(x + y\) as follows:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"为了确定函数 \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \) 的垂直渐近线和水平渐近线，我们需要分析函数的分母和分子。

首先，我们找到垂直渐近线。垂直渐近线出现在分母为零且分子不为零的地方。因此，我们解方程：
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0. \]
我们可以将二次方程因式分解如下：
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]
将每个因子设为零，我们得到解：
\[ x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{或} \quad x + 2 = 0, \]
这给出我们：
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{或} \quad x = -2. \]
因此，垂直渐近线是 \( x = 7 \) 和 \( x = -2 \)。所以，\( a = 7 \) 和 \( b = -2 \)。

接下来，我们找到水平渐近线。水平渐近线由分子和分母的次数决定。分子的次数是1，分母的次数是2。由于分子的次数小于分母的次数，水平渐近线是 \( y = 0 \)。所以，\( c = 0 \)。

"To find the smallest positive number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

\[

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45

\[

Add these values together:
\[

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9

\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8

Add these values together:

Since the quotient is 4 and the remainder is 0, we write the remainders in reverse order to get the base 9 number:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

Subtract \( E \) from both sides:
\[ M = -E \]

Now, substitute \( M = -E \) into the first equation:
\[ 3E + (-E) = E + 3C \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 2E = E + 3C \]
Subtract \( E \) from both sides:
\[ E = 3C \]

Now we know that \( E = 3C \). This means that one eraser weighs the same as three erasers. Therefore, the weight of one eraser is three times the weight of one eraser.

To find out how many erasers weigh the same as one eraser, we need to determine how many times the weight of one eraser is equal to the weight of one eraser. Since \( E = 3C \), we can see that one eraser weighs the same as three erasers.

Thus, the weight of one eraser is equal to the weight of three erasers. Therefore, the weight of one eraser is equal to the weight of three erasers.

The weight of one eraser is equal to the weight of three erasers.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \(a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these products:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:
\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the base of the cylinder.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]

We are also given that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4
\]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{d}{dt}(\pi r^2 h) = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substituting the given values into this equation:
\[
\pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 20\pi
\]

Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
4r^2 = 20
\]

Next, solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[
r^2 = 5
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(r\):
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{5}}
\]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards. The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
As \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(f(x)\) increases from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\).

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) decreases from \(a\) to \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) decreases from \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\) to \(-\infty\). Therefore, the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the range of \(f(x)\) must cover all real numbers. This means that the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must overlap with the range of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]

### Step 4: Solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\)
Rearrange the inequality to form a polynomial inequality:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factor out the greatest common factor:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the polynomial are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the inequality holds. The sign chart for \(a(a - 2)(a + 1)\) is as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{c|cccc}
a & (-\infty, -1) & -1 & (-1, 0) & 0 & (0, 2) & 2 & (2, \infty) \\
\hline
a & - & - & - & 0 & + & + & + \\
a - 2 & - & - & - & - & - & 0 & + \\
a + 1 & - & 0 & + & + & + & + & + \\
\hline
a(a - 2)(a + 1) & - & 0 & + & 0 & - & 0 & + \\
\end{array}
\]

From the sign chart, we see that \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) in the intervals \([-1, 0]\) and \([0, 2]\). Combining these intervals, we get:
\[ -1 \leq a \leq 2. \]

Since we are asked to find the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, the largest value is:

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for solutions where \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation.

By inspection, we can see that if \(\lambda = 2\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
-2^4 x^3 + 2^2 (2 \cdot 2 + 2^2)x^2 - 2^2 (1 + 2)x + 2^2 - 1 = 0 \implies -16x^3 + 16 \cdot 6x^2 - 16 \cdot 3x + 4 - 1 = 0 \implies -16x^3 + 96x^2 - 48x + 3 = 0.
\]
We can factor this polynomial as:
\[
-16x^3 + 96x^2 - 48x + 3 = -16(x - \frac{1}{2})(x - \frac{3}{2})^2.
\]
The roots are \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(x = \frac{3}{2}\) (with multiplicity 2). Since \(x = \frac{3}{2}\) is not in the interval \([0,1]\), we only consider \(x = \frac{1}{2}\). For \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), we have:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
This is a fixed point, not a periodic point of period 2. Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) does not work.

By further analysis or numerical methods, we find that the correct value of \(\lambda\) is \(\lambda = 3\). For \(\lambda = 3\), the equation becomes:
\[
-3^4 x^3 + 3^2 (2 \cdot 3 + 3^2)x^2 - 3^2 (1 + 3)x + 3^2 - 1 = 0 \implies -81x^3 + 9 \cdot 15x^2 - 9 \cdot 4x + 9 - 1 = 0 \implies -81x^3 + 135x^2 - 36x + 8 = 0.
\]
By solving this cubic equation, we find that \(x = \frac{2}{3}\) is a solution. For \(x = \frac{2}{3}\), we have:
\[

"To solve for the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) such that

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\):

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\):

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by \(\cos 25^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{1 + \tan 5^\circ}{\tan 25^\circ - 1}.

We recognize that this expression is in the form of the tangent of a sum of angles formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\), with \(A = 45^\circ\) and \(B = -20^\circ\):

\[
\tan 45^\circ = 1, \quad \tan(-20^\circ) = -\tan 20^\circ.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}

- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.

"要 determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:

\[
f(\cos \theta, \cos \phi) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \phi} + \cos \phi \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \sin \phi + \cos \phi \sin \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi).
\]

The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). To find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \), we note that if \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \), then \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} - \theta \). Therefore, \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2} - \theta\right) = \sin \theta \). So, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line of parallelism. In this case, the distance from \(A\) to the line through \(G\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Note that triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(AMN\) and the line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), which means \(EG\) is parallel to \(BF\) and \(ng\) is parallel to \(CF\). Therefore, triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(AMN\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{1}{2}\) (since \(G\) is the midpoint of \(MN\) in triangle \(AMN\)).

The area ratio of triangle \(ENG\) to triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\).

Since the area of triangle \(AMN\) is 64, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is:
\[

" prime numbers less than or equal to 6 are 2, 3, 5. We need to determine the probability that the sum of the two numbers chosen by Paul and Jessica is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

First, let's count the number of even and odd prime numbers in the set {2, 3, 5}. There is 1 even number (2) and 2 odd numbers (3, 5).

The total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jessica each choose a number is:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \]

Next, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two ways:
1. Both Paul and Jessica choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jessica choose an odd number.

The number of ways both Paul and Jessica can choose an even number is:
\[ 1 \times 1 = 1 \]

The number of ways both Paul and Jessica can choose an odd number is:
\[ 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

So, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[ 1 + 4 = 5 \]

The probability that the sum of the two numbers chosen is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the two shaded triangles.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Area of the First Triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0 and 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 and 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must end in ""00"".

Next, we need to ensure that the number has at least one factor of 2. Since the number ends in ""00"", it already has a factor of 2 (and actually a factor of 100, which includes two factors of 2).

Now, we need to ensure that the number has at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the number must have at least two 1's (because \(1 + 1 = 2\) and we need the sum to be at least 6 to have two factors of 3).

Combining these requirements, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is ""1100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has two 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, ""1100"" is not a valid number.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number that ends in ""00"" and has at least two 1's is ""11100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has three 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.
- It has one 1 in the hundreds place and two 1's in the tens place, so it has at least one factor of 2.

Therefore, ""11100"" is a valid number. To confirm, we can divide 11100 by 450:

\[ 11100 \div 450 = 24.6667 \]

Since 11100 is not an integer multiple of 450, we need to find a larger number. The next smallest number that ends in ""00"" and has at least two 1's is ""111100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has four 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, ""111100"" is not a valid number.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number that ends in ""00"" and has at least two 1's is ""1111100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has five 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, ""1111100"" is not a valid number.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number that ends in ""00"" and has at least two 1's is ""11111100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it has a factor of \(5^2\).
- It has six 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.
- It has three 1's in the hundreds place and three 1's in the tens place, so it has at least two factors of 2.

"To determine the probability that a checkerboard square is chosen, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of the two dice rolls and how they map to the squares on the checkerboard.

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each die:**
   - The first die (ronde) can show a remainder of 1, 2, or 3 when divided by 4. This means there are 3 possible outcomes for the first die.
   - The second die (dvd) can show a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4 when divided by 5. This means there are 4 possible outcomes for the second die.

2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since the outcomes of the two dice are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each die.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12
   \]
   So, there are 12 possible outcomes for the pair of numbers rolled.

3. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - A checkerboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so there are 64 squares in total.
   - We need to find out how many of these 12 outcomes map to a square on the checkerboard. Since the outcomes are equally likely and there are 12 possible outcomes, each outcome corresponds to a unique square on a smaller grid of 12 squares (not the 64 squares of the checkerboard).

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen square from the checkerboard is one of the 12 squares that correspond to the possible outcomes of the dice rolls is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of squares on the checkerboard.
   \[
   \frac{12}{64} = \frac{3}{16}

Therefore, the probability that the checkerboard square chosen is one of the squares that can be chosen by the dice rolls is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{16}}\).","[3/16, '\\frac{3}{16}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

- \( \theta \) represents the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, measured from the positive \( x \)-axis.
- \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) indicates that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This means that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

Let \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) be the roots of \( f(x) \). Then, by the definition of \( g(x) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \]
This implies:
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]
Since \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), we have:
\[ f(r_1) = 0, \quad f(r_2) = 0, \quad f(r_3) = 0 \]

For \( f(x + 5) = 0 \), we need:
\[ x + 5 = r_1, \quad x + 5 = r_2, \quad x + 5 = r_3 \]

Solving for \( x \) in each equation, we get:
\[ x = r_1 - 5, \quad x = r_2 - 5, \quad x = r_3 - 5 \]

Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( a_n x^3 + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 \), the sum of the roots taken one at a time is given by:
\[ -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are:
\[ a_3 = 1, \quad a_2 = -49, \quad a_1 = 623, \quad a_0 = -2015 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), which are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of these roots is:
\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) \]

Distributing the subtraction, we get:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 5 - 5 - 5 \]

Simplifying, we find:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.

Rearranging this equation, we get:

Since \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3\):

\]
\[
\tan 40^\circ + \tan 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ (\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3).

\[

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ

3. **Express the sum of all interior angles:**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the lower bound:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the upper bound:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

7. **Combine the results:**
   From the inequalities \(n \geq 8\) and \(n \leq 8\), we conclude:
   \[
   n = 8

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the equation:

\[
(t+2)t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

First, expand and simplify the left-hand side:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Simplify inside the square root:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) to find a solution. Let's test some values:

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}

\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}

\]
\[
9^2 \equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \). Substitute \( \sqrt{8} = 10 \) back into the quadratic formula:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
t = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6

"To determine the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:
   \[
   s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of one face of the cube:**
   Each face of a cube is a square. The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   Substituting the side length \( s = 1 \) foot:
   \[
   A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot}

3. **Determine the total surface area of the cube:**
   A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total surface area \( S \) is:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a binomial \(a + b\) is \(a - b\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[

\[

"To find the sum of the first 2003 terms of the sequence of odd numbers \(1, 3, 5, 7, \dots\), we can use the formula for the sum of the first \(n\) odd numbers. The sum of the first \(n\) odd numbers is given by:

\[
S_n = n^2
\]

In this problem, \(n = 2003\). Therefore, we substitute \(n = 2003\) into the formula:

\[
S_{2003} = 2003^2
\]

Next, we calculate \(2003^2\):

\[
2003^2 = (2000 + 3)^2
\]

Using the binomial expansion formula \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\), where \(a = 2000\) and \(b = 3\), we get:

\[
(2000 + 3)^2 = 2000^2 + 2 \cdot 2000 \cdot 3 + 3^2

"为了 find the value of \( g(f(5)-1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

Next, we perform step 2. We need to subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.

Now, we move to step 3. We need to evaluate \( g \) at \( x = 6 \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by:
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.
\]
Using the determinant formula for the cross product, we get:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
Simplifying each component, we have:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

1. **Identify the range for \(x\):**
   - The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(5\) and \(-5\).
   - Points inside the rectangle must have \(x\)-coordinates strictly between \(-5\) and \(5\).
   - Therefore, \(x\) can take the integer values: \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\).

   - The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(4\) and \(-4\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[

and

\[

We can further distribute each term:

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these back into our expression, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are equal. Therefore:

[\triangle ACD] = [\triangle ABC] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

Next, we can eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

Next, we divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation. We substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given definition \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\), we need to identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\).

Here, \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\). Substituting these values into the definition, we get:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in clockwise order, they must alternate.

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (for rotations) and by 2 (for reflections). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we are not considering the specific order of the points relative to each other. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This is given by:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]
   However, each pair of points can be arranged in 2 ways (either \(AB\) and \(CD\) or \(CD\) and \(AB\)), so the total number of distinct arrangements is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Count the Number of Favorable Arrangements**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following two ways: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, there are 2 favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

"Given two circles with centers \(D\) and radii 1 and 2, respectively, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the shaded region is given as:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two circular segments, one from each circle. The area of a circular segment can be calculated as the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord.

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]
The area of the triangle in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle in the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the circular segment in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the circular segment in the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin \theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
\]
The area of the triangle in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]
Therefore, the area of the circular segment in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the circular segment in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin \theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two circular segments:
\[
2\theta - 2\sin \theta + \frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin \theta = \frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin \theta
\]
We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

To solve this equation, we can use numerical methods or recognize that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution. Let's verify:
\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
Since \(\sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), the equation holds true. Therefore, the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \text{ radians} = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical glass and the spherical tank and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of the glass.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical glass. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical glass, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic centimeters}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

\[

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a committee consisting of 8 union members and 6 demonstrate members, with the condition that at least one member from each group must be included, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of union members or only of demonstrate members).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of union members. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 8 union members.

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of demonstrate members. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 6 demonstration members.

\[

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of union members and the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of demonstration members from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee.

We need to find the value of \( n \). Let's test some integer values around the cube root of 120, which is approximately 4.93.

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\).

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{1}{8}\) (by Vieta's formulas).

Since \(D\) is a point on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\), it follows that \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines to express \(\cos \angle BDC\):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos \angle BDC.
\]
Since \(BD = CD = \sqrt{AD^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{100 + x^2}\), we substitute these values into the Law of Cosines:

\[
x^2 = 100 - (100 + x^2) \cos 3\theta.

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^2 + (100 + x^2) \cos 3\theta = 100,

\[
x^2 (1 + \cos 3\theta) + 100 \cos 3\theta = 100.

\[
x^2 (4\cos^3 \theta - 2\cos \theta + 1) + 400\cos^3 \theta - 300\cos \theta = 100.

Since \(x = AM \cos \theta = 11 \cos \theta\), we substitute \(x = 11 \cos \theta\) into the equation:
\[
(11 \cos \theta)^2 (4\cos^3 \theta - 2\cos \theta + 1) + 400\cos^3 \theta - 300\cos \theta = 100,

AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{33}{5}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \frac{1089}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{3025}{25} + \frac{1089}{25}} = \sqrt{\frac{4114}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{4114}}{5} = \frac{11\sqrt{34}}{5}.
\]
The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \frac{11\sqrt{34}}{5} + \frac{11\sqrt{34}}{5} + \frac{66}{5} = \frac{22\sqrt{34} + 66}{5} = \frac{22(\sqrt{34} + 3)}{5}.

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is equal to \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \(3^7\):**
   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
   \]

2. **Determine the sum of 27 consecutive integers:**
   The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1)d)
   \]
   where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference. For consecutive integers, \(d = 1\). Therefore, the sum becomes:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \times (2a + (n-1))
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the sum of 27 consecutive integers:**
   Given \(S = 2187\) and \(n = 27\), we substitute these values into the sum formula:
   \[
   2187 = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26)
   \]

4. **Solve for \(a\):**
   First, simplify the equation:
   \[
   2187 = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4374 = 27 \times (2a + 26)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 27:
   \[
   162 = 2a + 26
   \]
   Subtract 26 from both sides:
   \[
   136 = 2a
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   a = 68
   \]

5. **Find the median of the 27 consecutive integers:**
   The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. For 27 integers, the middle number is the 14th term. The \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_k = a + (k-1)d
   \]
   For the 14th term (\(k = 14\)):
   \[
   a_{14} = 68 + (14-1) \times 1 = 68 + 13 = 81

Therefore, the median of these 27 consecutive integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which is equivalent to:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables taken one at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine which grade has the number of boys using the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls using the bus, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of girls using the bus for each grade and then compare it to the number of boys using the bus for that grade.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of girls using the bus for each grade:

1. **9th Grade:**
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2\)
   - \(135\%\) of 118.2: \(118.2 \times 1.35 = 159.07\)
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\)
   - Difference: \(159.07 - 123.3 = 35.77\)

2. **10th Grade:**
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3\)
   - \(135\%\) of 99.3: \(99.3 \times 1.35 = 133.605\)
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\)
   - Difference: \(133.605 - 103.2 = 30.405\)

3. **11th Grade:**
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4\)
   - \(135\%\) of 41.4: \(41.4 \times 1.35 = 55.65\)
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\)
   - Difference: \(61.8 - 55.65 = 6.15\)

4. **12th Grade:**
   - Number of girls using the bus: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8\)
   - \(135\%\) of 25.8: \(25.8 \times 1.35 = 34.83\)
   - Number of boys using the bus: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\)
   - Difference: \(34.83 - 34.8 = 0.03\)

From the calculations, we can see that the smallest difference is in the 12th grade, which is \(0.03\). Therefore, the number of boys using the bus in the 12th grade is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls using the bus.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"Given a rectangular piece of land enclosed by a path that includes two lengths of the rectangle and two semicircles, we need to find the maximum possible area of the land. The total length of the path is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The path consists of two lengths of the rectangle and the circumferences of two semicircles, which together form one full circle with radius \( W/2 \). Therefore, the total length of the path can be expressed as:
\[
2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know that this total length is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400

Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = L \times W = \left(\frac{400 - \pi W}{2}\right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Substituting \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the curve \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) from the origin to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \((x^2 - 3)^2\):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the function \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[

Factor out the common term \(2x\):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm\sqrt{2}

\[

3. For \(x = -\sqrt{2}\):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}

\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us one solution \( x = 0 \), but since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We need to solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us two solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \), but since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid. Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) in the interval \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ 2^3 - 2(2^2) - 3(2) + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Since \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), it is not a valid solution. We need to factor \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 \) using synthetic division or polynomial division. However, since we already found a valid solution in the interval \( x \leq 3 \), we do not need to find the roots in the interval \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

Therefore, the answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"Given a regular octahedron with vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) and a point \(P\) such that the distances from \(P\) to these vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and \(x\), we need to determine the value of \(x\).

First, recall that a regular octahedron can be inscribed in a cube. Let's place the cube in a coordinate system with side length \(s\). The vertices of the octahedron can be taken as:
\[
A = (s, s, s), \quad B = (-s, s, s), \quad C = (s, -s, s), \quad D = (-s, -s, s), \quad E = (s, s, -s), \quad F = (-s, s, -s)
\]

We are given the distances from \(P\) to these vertices:
\[
PA = 3, \quad PB = 7, \quad PC = 8, \quad PD = 9, \quad PE = 11, \quad PF = x
\]

Let the coordinates of \(P\) be \((a, b, c)\). The distance from \(P\) to any vertex \((x_i, y_i, z_i)\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{(a - x_i)^2 + (b - y_i)^2 + (c - z_i)^2}
\]

We can write the equations for the given distances:
\[
\sqrt{(a - s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c - s)^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(a + s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c - s)^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{(a - s)^2 + (b + s)^2 + (c - s)^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{(a + s)^2 + (b + s)^2 + (c - s)^2} = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{(a - s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c + s)^2} = 11
\]
\[
\sqrt{(a + s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c + s)^2} = x
\]

To simplify, square each equation:
\[
(a - s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c - s)^2 = 9
\]
\[
(a + s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c - s)^2 = 49
\]
\[
(a - s)^2 + (b + s)^2 + (c - s)^2 = 64
\]
\[
(a + s)^2 + (b + s)^2 + (c - s)^2 = 81
\]
\[
(a - s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c + s)^2 = 121
\]
\[
(a + s)^2 + (b - s)^2 + (c + s)^2 = x^2
\]

Next, expand each squared term:
\[
a^2 - 2as + s^2 + b^2 - 2bs + s^2 + c^2 - 2cs + s^2 = 9
\]
\[
a^2 + 2as + s^2 + b^2 - 2bs + s^2 + c^2 - 2cs + s^2 = 49
\]
\[
a^2 - 2as + s^2 + b^2 + 2bs + s^2 + c^2 - 2cs + s^2 = 64
\]
\[
a^2 + 2as + s^2 + b^2 + 2bs + s^2 + c^2 - 2cs + s^2 = 81
\]
\[
a^2 - 2as + s^2 + b^2 - 2bs + s^2 + c^2 + 2cs + s^2 = 121
\]
\[
a^2 + 2as + s^2 + b^2 - 2bs + s^2 + c^2 + 2cs + s^2 = x^2
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3s^2 - 2as - 2bs - 2cs = 9
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3s^2 + 2as - 2bs - 2cs = 49
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3s^2 - 2as + 2bs - 2cs = 64
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3s^2 + 2as + 2bs - 2cs = 81
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3s^2 - 2as - 2bs + 2cs = 121
\]
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 3s^2 + 2as - 2bs + 2cs = x^2
\]

Let \(A = a^2 + b^2 + c^2\) and \(B = 3s^2\). Then the equations become:
\[
A + B - 2as - 2bs - 2cs = 9
\]
\[
A + B + 2as - 2bs - 2cs = 49
\]
\[
A + B - 2as + 2bs - 2cs = 64
\]
\[
A + B + 2as + 2bs - 2cs = 81
\]
\[
A + B - 2as - 2bs + 2cs = 121
\]
\[
A + B + 2as - 2bs + 2cs = x^2
\]

Add all six equations:
\[
6A + 6B = 420
\]
\[
A + B = 70
\]

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
4as = 40 \implies as = 10
\]

Subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
4bs = 55 \implies bs = 13.75
\]

Subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
4cs = 72 \implies cs = 18
\]

Substitute \(A + B = 70\) into the sixth equation:
\[
70 + 2as - 2bs + 2cs = x^2
\]
\[
70 + 2(10) - 2(13.75) + 2(18) = x^2
\]
\[
70 + 20 - 27.5 + 36 = x^2
\]
\[
98.5 = x^2
\]

Thus, \(x = \sqrt{98.5}\). However, this is not correct. re }

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the ball Jen throws to the acceleration of the ball Jack throws, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

According to the problem, Jen throws the ball with the same force as Jack. Therefore, the force \( F \) is the same for both balls. Let's denote the mass of the ball Jen throws as \( m_J \) and the mass of the ball Jack throws as \( m_K \). Similarly, let's denote the acceleration of the ball Jen throws as \( a_J \) and the acceleration of the ball Jack throws as \( a_K \). Using Newton's second law, we can write the following equations for the two balls:

\[ F = m_J \cdot a_J \]
\[ F = m_K \cdot a_K \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both balls, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_K \cdot a_K \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the ball Jen throws to the acceleration of the ball Jack throws, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{m_K}{m_J} \]

We are given that the mass of the ball Jen throws is 200 grams and the mass of the ball Jack throws is 150 grams. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the ball Jen throws to the acceleration of the ball Jack throws is:

" first, we need to convert the decimal number \(629_{10}\) to its base 7 and base 8 representations.

**Converting \(629_{10}\) to base 7:**

1. Divide 629 by 7: \(629 \div 7 = 89\) with a remainder of 6.
2. Divide 89 by 7: \(89 \div 7 = 12\) with a remainder of 5.
3. Divide 12 by 7: \(12 \div 7 = 1\) with a remainder of 5.
4. Divide 1 by 7: \(1 \div 7 = 0\) with a remainder of 1.

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

**Converting \(629_{10}\) to base 8:**

1. Divide 629 by 8: \(629 \div 8 = 78\) with a remainder of 5.
2. Divide 78 by 8: \(78 \div 8 = 9\) with a remainder of 6.
3. Divide 9 by 8: \(9 \div 8 = 1\) with a remainder of 1.
4. Divide 1 by 8: \(1 \div 8 = 0\) with a remainder of 1.

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

Now, we compare the base 7 representation \(1556_7\) with the base 8 representation \(1165_8\) to find the common digits.

- The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
- The digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Counting the occurrences of these digits, we have:
- The digit 1 appears 2 times.
- The digit 5 appears 2 times.
- The digit 6 appears 1 time.

Adding these together, the total number of common digits is \(2 + 2 + 1 = 5\).

Therefore, the number of common digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred in the den, we need to consider the following information:

1. There are 6 blue-eyed girls and 10 brown-eyed girls.
2. Each girl shakes hands with every other girl, but not with herself.

First, let's calculate the total number of handshakes if there were no restrictions (i.e., if each girl shook hands with every other girl including herself). This is a combination problem where we need to choose 2 girls out of the total 16 girls to shake hands. The number of ways to choose 2 girls out of 16 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

Here, \( n = 16 \) and \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{16}{2} = \frac{16!}{2!(16-2)!} = \frac{16!}{2! \cdot 14!} = \frac{16 \times 15 \times 14!}{2 \times 1 \times 14!} = \frac{16 \times 15}{2 \times 1} = 120
\]

This calculation gives us the total number of handshakes if there were no restrictions. However, since each girl does not shake hands with herself, we need to subtract the number of handshakes that would have occurred between each girl and herself. Since there are 16 girls, there are 16 handshakes that would have occurred between each girl and herself (one for each girl).

Therefore, the total number of handshakes that actually occurred is:

\[
120 - 16 = 104
\]

Thus, the total number of handshakes in the den is \(\boxed{104}\).","[104, '104']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[
abc = (-2)(-2) - 0^2 = 4.

Since \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(abc = 4\), the numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 4 = t^3 - 4\). The roots of this polynomial are:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = k \cdot AD\). Let \(AD = a\), then \(AB = ka\). The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-\frac{ka}{2}, \frac{a}{2})\)
- \(B = (\frac{ka}{2}, \frac{a}{2})\)
- \(C = (\frac{ka}{2}, -\frac{a}{2})\)
- \(D = (-\frac{ka}{2}, -\frac{a}{2})\)

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x + \frac{ka}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
\]

We need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{ka}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{ka}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ka x + \frac{k^2 a^2}{4} + y^2 - a y + \frac{a^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < ka x + \frac{k^2 a^2}{4} - a y + \frac{a^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ka x - a y < -\frac{k^2 a^2}{4} - \frac{a^2}{4}
\]

Factoring out \(a\) on the left-hand side:
\[
a(k x - y) < -\frac{a^2 (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]

Dividing both sides by \(a\) (assuming \(a \neq 0\)):
\[
k x - y < -\frac{a (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
1. For vertex \(B\):
\[
k x - y < \frac{a (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]
2. For vertex \(C\):
\[
k x + y < \frac{a (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]
3. For vertex \(D\):
\[
k x + y > -\frac{a (k^2 + 1)}{4}
\]

These inequalities define a region inside the rectangle where the point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex. This region is a square centered at \(O\) with side length \(\frac{a (k^2 + 1)}{2k}\).

To find the area of this square, we calculate:
\[
\text{Area of the square} = \left(\frac{a (k^2 + 1)}{2k}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 (k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = AB \times AD = ka \times a = k a^2
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of the square}}{\text{Area of the rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{a^2 (k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}}{k a^2} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^3}

     \[
     f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6

3. **Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \).
     \[
     8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^{3 \times \frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4

     f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4

f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12

"To determine how many feet less Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each person covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim travels diagonally across the rectangular piece of land. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{\text{Length}^2 + \text{Width}^2} \]

For Jim, the length of the rectangle is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]

\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the shortest possible distance that can be traveled if starting from any point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then determine the minimum of these distances.

Let's consider each starting point and calculate the total distance for all possible routes:

1. **Starting from point \(A\):**
   - Route \(A \to B \to C \to D\): The total distance is \(AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\).
   - Route \(A \to B \to D \to C\): The total distance is \(AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\).
   - Route \(A \to C \to B \to D\): The total distance is \(AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\).
   - Route \(A \to C \to D \to B\): The total distance is \(AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\).
   - Route \(A \to D \to B \to C\): The total distance is \(AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\).
   - Route \(A \to D \to C \to B\): The total distance is \(AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\).

   The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is \(13\).

2. **Starting from point \(B\):**
   - Route \(B \to A \to C \to D\): The total distance is \(BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16\).
   - Route \(B \to A \to D \to C\): The total distance is \(BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\).
   - Route \(B \to C \to A \to D\): The total distance is \(BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\).
   - Route \(B \to C \to D \to A\): The total distance is \(BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\).
   - Route \(B \to D \to A \to C\): The total distance is \(BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\).
   - Route \(B \to D \to C \to A\): The total distance is \(BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\).

   The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is \(13\).

3. **Starting from point \(C\):**
   - Route \(C \to A \to B \to D\): The total distance is \(CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\).
   - Route \(C \to A \to D \to B\): The total distance is \(CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\).
   - Route \(C \to B \to A \to D\): The total distance is \(CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\).
   - Route \(C \to B \to D \to A\): The total distance is \(CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\).
   - Route \(C \to D \to A \to B\): The total distance is \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\).
   - Route \(C \to D \to B \to A\): The total distance is \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\).

   The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is \(13\).

4. **Starting from point \(D\):**
   - Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\): The total distance is \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\).
   - Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\): The total distance is \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\).
   - Route \(D \to B \to A \to C\): The total distance is \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\).
   - Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\): The total distance is \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\).
   - Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\): The total distance is \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\).
   - Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\): The total distance is \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\).

   The minimum distance starting from \(D\) is \(14\).

From the calculations above, the shortest possible distance that can be traveled is \(13\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
