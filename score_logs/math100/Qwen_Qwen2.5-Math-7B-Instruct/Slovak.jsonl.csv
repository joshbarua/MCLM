"To find the value of \(DE\), we start by analyzing the given right triangle \(DEF\). We know that \(\angle DEF = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In this triangle, the opposite side to angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = 0.7
\]

We are given that \(EF = 7\). Substituting this value into the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]

To find \(DF\), we solve for \(DF\) by multiplying both sides of the equation by \(DF\) and then dividing both sides by 0.7:

\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF \implies DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we know the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\) is 10, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this triangle, we have:

\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:

\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2 \implies 100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

To find \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides of the equation:

\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can use the formula for rotation in the complex plane. The rotation of a complex number \( z \) around a point \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \), \( c = 2 - 3i \), and \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \). First, we need to find \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we need to multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \). Recall that \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Therefore, we have:

\[ (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We can expand this product using the distributive property:

\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Simplifying each term, we get:

\[ \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 \]
\[ \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \]
\[ -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i \]
\[ -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = 3 \]

Adding these together, we have:

\[ 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single ""block"":**
   Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:**
   The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:**
   Within the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block, there are 3 people who can be arranged in \(3!\) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block is:
   \[
   3! = 6
   \]

4. **Combine the two results:**
   To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block:
   \[
   120 \times 6 = 720

Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). We substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

Calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10

Calculate \((10x^3)^2\):

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 (x^3)^2 = 100x^6
\]

Calculate \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3\):

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = -\frac{1}{8x^6}

Combine all the parts:

T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot \frac{1}{x^6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(4)(6)(8) \pmod{7}

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

Now multiply these reduced terms together:

\[

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated around its center. The angle of rotation for each symmetry is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate the angle of rotation as follows:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees by which the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12
\]
\[
x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7
\]
\[
y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \((6, -1)\) cannot be the correct fourth vertex. Let's consider the possibility that the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13
\]
\[
x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12
\]
\[
y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8\) and \(x > 7\), this solution is valid. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\).

The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

Substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:
\[

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will make the function undefined and thus create vertical asymptotes.

First, we factor the denominator:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]
Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]
So, the solutions are:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). This means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we find the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator \( 2x \) is a linear polynomial (degree 1), and the denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). This means \( c = 0 \).

Now, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) without directly squaring 99, we can use algebraic manipulation. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that makes it easier to compute.

First, observe that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) to find the corresponding values of \( x \) and \( y \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), then

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**

   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   For \(18_9\):

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( t \) represents the weight of one tree.
- \( s \) represents the weight of one squig.
- \( g \) represents the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Desať treekov váži toľko ako tri squigs a jeden goolee.
2. Dva treeky a jeden goolee sú rovnaké na váhu ako один squig.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following equations:
1. \( 10t = 3s + g \)
2. \( 2t + g = s \)

We need to find the value of \( t \) in terms of \( s \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = s - 2t \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ 10t = 3s + s - 2t \]
\[ 10t = 4s - 2t \]
\[ 10t + 2t = 4s \]
\[ 12t = 4s \]
\[ t = \frac{4s}{12} \]
\[ t = \frac{s}{3} \]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

\[

\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2

\[

\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[
a \cdot bt = abt

\[

\[

\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

First, we calculate the volume of water added to the tank in one hour. Since the tank is cylindrical, the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder. In this problem, the height \(h\) is the height of water added in one hour, which is 4 meters. Therefore, the volume of water added in one hour is:
\[ V = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 4\pi r^2 \]

We know that the volume of water added in one hour is also \(20\pi\) cubic meters. So, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 4\pi r^2 = 20\pi \]

Next, we solve for \(r^2\) by dividing both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):
\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5 \]

To find \(r\), we take the square root of both sides:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \(f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x \geq 0\), which means the graph does not intersect any vertical line \(y = c\) where \(c > 0\). Therefore, \(a\) must be non-zero.

   - If \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). As \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(f(x)\) increases from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\). Therefore, for \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) covers the interval \([a^3, \infty)\).
   - If \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x) = ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). As \(x\) increases from \(a\) to \(\infty\), \(f(x)\) decreases from \(a^3\) to \(-\infty\). Therefore, for \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x)\) covers the interval \((-\infty, a^3]\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a = a(x + 2)\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line increases as \(x\) increases, and if \(a < 0\), the line decreases as \(x\) increases. At \(x = a\), the value of the function is \(f(a) = a(a + 2) = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, for \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x)\) covers the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\), and for \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x)\) covers the interval \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\).

To ensure that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once, the intervals covered by the two pieces of the function must together cover all real numbers. This means that the maximum value of the interval covered by \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of the interval covered by \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\).

- For \(a > 0\), the interval covered by \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \([a^3, \infty)\), and the interval covered by \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). Therefore, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0

  Factoring out \(a\), we get:
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0

  Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
  \[
  a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0
  \]
  The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \((2, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) for \(a \in (0, 2]\) and \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) > 0\) for \(a \in (2, \infty)\). Therefore, \(a \leq 2\).

- For \(a < 0\), the interval covered by \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \((-\infty, a^3]\), and the interval covered by \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\). Therefore, we need \(a^2 + 2a \leq a^3\).
  \[
  a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0
  \]
  Factoring out \(a\), we get:
  \[
  a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0
  \]
  Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
  \[
  a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0
  \]
  The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \((-1, 0)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0\) for \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\) and \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) < 0\) for \(a \in (-1, 0)\). Therefore, \(a \leq -1\).

Combining the results for \(a > 0\) and \(a < 0\), the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(f(x)\) intersects every vertical line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to substitute \(f(x)\) into itself and solve for \(x\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, one solution is \(x = 0\). For \(x \neq 0\), we need:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^3 x - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda^2 - 1\), we get:
\[
(\lambda^2 - 1)(\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + x - 1) = 0.
\]
So, either \(\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\) or \(\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + x - 1 = 0\). The first equation gives \(\lambda = 1\) or \(\lambda = -1\). Since \(\lambda\) is in the interval \([0, 4]\), we have \(\lambda = 1\).

For \(\lambda = 1\), the function is \(f(x) = x(1 - x)\). We check if there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x + x^2) = x(1 - x + x^2 - x + x^2) = x(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x.
\]
So, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), and there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) (for example, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\)).

For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we need to check if the equation \(\lambda^2 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + x - 1 = 0\) has a solution in \([0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). The discriminant of the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 x^2 + (1 - \lambda^2)x - 1 = 0\) is:
\[
(1 - \lambda^2)^2 + 4\lambda^2 = 1 - 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^4 + 4\lambda^2 = \lambda^4 + 2\lambda^2 + 1 = (\lambda^2 + 1)^2.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = \frac{\lambda^2 - 1 \pm (\lambda^2 + 1)}{2\lambda^2}.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = \frac{2\lambda^2}{2\lambda^2} = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = \frac{-2}{2\lambda^2} = -\frac{1}{\lambda^2}.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 > 1\) for \(\lambda \in (1, 4]\), \(-\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\) is not in the interval \([0,1]\). Therefore, the only solution is \(x = 1\), and \(f(1) = 1\), so there is no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

Thus, the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 1\). The answer is:

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which the given equation holds, we start by simplifying the expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[

\]

We can use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine to simplify the numerator and the denominator. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

Using these formulas, we can rewrite the numerator as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Similarly, we can rewrite the denominator as:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the sum-to-product identities to simplify the numerator:

\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin \left( \frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2} \right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ.
\]

For the denominator, we use the identity \(\cos 5^\circ = \sin 85^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 5^\circ\), but we need to express it in a form that will help us simplify. Instead, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\):

\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{3!}

Next, we calculate \( 7! \) and \( 3! \):

\]
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

\[
\frac{5040}{6} = 840
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y)
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_x = \frac{(1 - y^2) - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Similarly, for the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule again:

\[
f_y = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Simplifying the first term:

\[
f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_y = \frac{-xy + (1 - x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{1 - x^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]

To find the critical points, we set both partial derivatives to zero:

\[
f_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f_y = 0
\]

This gives us the system of equations:

\[
\frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - x^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]

Simplifying these equations:

\[
1 - y^2 - xy = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 - x^2 - xy = 0
\]

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[
(1 - y^2 - xy) - (1 - x^2 - xy) = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]

Factoring the difference of squares:

\[
(x - y)(x + y) = 0
\]

Thus, we have two cases:

1. \( x = y \)
2. \( x = -y \)

**Case 1: \( x = y \)**

Substitute \( x = y \) into the function \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take its derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2x) \right)
\]

Simplifying the derivative:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]

Setting the derivative to zero:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into \( f(x, x) \):

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1
\]

**Case 2: \( x = -y \)**

Substitute \( x = -y \) into the function \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x, -x) = x \sqrt{1 - (-x)^2} + (-x) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0
\]

Thus, \( f(x, -x) = 0 \) for all \( x \).

** boundary points:**

We also need to check the boundary points where \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \):

- If \( x = 1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2}
  \]
  The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 1 when \( y = 0 \).

- If \( x = -1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}
  \]
  The minimum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is -1 when \( y = 0 \).

- If \( y = 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
  \]
  The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1 when \( x = 0 \).

- If \( y = -1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}
  \]
  The minimum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is -1 when \( x = 0 \).

From all these cases, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \( AG:GD = 2:1 \), \( BG:GE = 2:1 \), and \( CG:GF = 2:1 \).

Since the line passing through \( G \) is parallel to \( BC \), it creates two similar triangles: \( \triangle AMN \) and \( \triangle ABC \). The similarity ratio of these triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid \( G \) to the base \( BC \) and from the vertex \( A \) to the base \( BC \). This ratio is \( \frac{AG}{AG + GD} = \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

   Let's do the division step-by-step:

   - \(312500\) goes into \(21\) zero times, so we write \(0.\) and add a decimal point.
   - Add a zero to \(21\) to make it \(210\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(210\) zero times, so we add another zero to make it \(2100\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100\) zero times, so we add another zero to make it \(21000\).

   - \(312500\) goes into \(210000\) zero times, so we add another zero to make it \(2100000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100000\) six times (since \(312500 \times 6 = 1875000\)).

   - Subtract \(2187500\) from \(2250000\) to get a remainder of \(62500\).
   - Add another zero to \(62500\) to make it \(625000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(625000\) two times (since \(312500 \times 2 = 625000\)).

"To determine how many positive two-digit whole numbers are divisors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers and then identify all two-digit divisors of the GCD.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
\]

The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime that appears in both factorizations:
\[
\text{GCD}(100, 150) = 2^1 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 25 = 50
\]

Next, we need to find all two-digit divisors of 50. We list the divisors of 50:
\[
1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50
\]

From this list, we select the two-digit divisors:
\[

There are 3 two-digit divisors of 50. Therefore, the number of positive two-digit whole numbers that are divisors of both 100 and 150 is:

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we start by expressing \( 2^{24} \) in the form \( (2^k)^n \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \]
Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24. \]
There are 7 such divisors.

To verify, we check that each of these divisors makes \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power:
- For \( n = 2 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \).
- For \( n = 3 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \).
- For \( n = 4 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^6)^4 \).

- For \( n = 12 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^2)^{12} \).
- For \( n = 24 \), \( 2^{24} = (2^1)^{24} \).

"To determine how many five-cent coins Hillary has, we start by defining variables for the number of ten-cent coins and five-cent coins. Let's denote the number of ten-cent coins by \( t \) and the number of five-cent coins by \( f \).

We know two things from the problem:
1. Hillary has a total of 15 coins.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can express these two pieces of information as the following system of equations:
\[ t + f = 15 \]
\[ 10t + 5f = 75 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2t + f = 15 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ t + f = 15 \]
\[ 2t + f = 15 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( f \):
\[ (2t + f) - (t + f) = 15 - 15 \]
\[ 2t + f - t - f = 0 \]
\[ t = 0 \]

So, Hillary has 0 ten-cent coins. Since she has a total of 15 coins, the number of five-cent coins must be:

Therefore, the number of five-cent coins Hillary has is \(\boxed{15}\).","[15, '15']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine the probability that the sum of two numbers chosen randomly from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 6\) and \(k = 2\):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Now, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers. Since there is only one even number, there is only 1 way to choose 2 even numbers:

\[
\binom{1}{2} = 0
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers. There are 5 odd numbers, so the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers is:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

The total number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 even numbers or 2 odd numbers) is:

\[

The probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region in the given diagram, we need to analyze the two shaded triangles and calculate their areas separately before summing them up.

### Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the first triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:

Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the second triangle
The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units.

A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}

The total area \(A\) of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must end in ""00"".

Next, we need to ensure that the number contains at least one factor of 2. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last digit before the ""00"" must be 0, making the number end in ""100"". However, ""100"" is not a multiple of 450 because it does not contain two factors of 3. Therefore, we need to find a number that ends in ""100"" and contains at least two factors of 3.

The smallest number that ends in ""100"" and contains at least two factors of 3 is ""11100"". Let's check if ""11100"" is a multiple of 450:

\[ 11100 \div 450 = 24.6667 \]

Since 24.6667 is not an integer, ""11100"" is not a multiple of 450. We need to find a larger number that ends in ""100"" and contains at least two factors of 3. The next smallest number is ""1111100"". Let's check if ""1111100"" is a multiple of 450:

\[ 1111100 \div 450 = 2468.0222 \]

Since 2468.0222 is not an integer, ""1111100"" is not a multiple of 450. We need to find a larger number that ends in ""100"" and contains at least two factors of 3. The next smallest number is ""11111100"". Let's check if ""11111100"" is a multiple of 450:

\[ 11111100 \div 450 = 24691.3333 \]

Since 24691.3333 is not an integer, ""11111100"" is not a multiple of 450. We need to find a larger number that ends in ""100"" and contains at least two factors of 3. The next smallest number is ""11111111100"". Let's check if ""11111111100"" is a multiple of 450:

\[ 11111111100 \div 450 = 24691358 \]

Since 24691358 is an integer, ""11111111100"" is a multiple of 450. Therefore, the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only zeros and ones is:

"To determine the probability that the figure will be placed on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to follow these steps:

2. **Determine the number of shaded squares:**
   The problem states that the chessboard is divided into four equal quadrants, and each quadrant has a shaded square in the top-left corner. Therefore, there are 4 shaded squares.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability \( P \) of the figure being placed on a shaded square is the ratio of the number of shaded squares to the total number of squares. Thus, we have:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \). If \( r \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( g(r) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), it follows that \( f(r + 5) = 0 \). Therefore, \( r + 5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \).

Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15.

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). Vieta's formulas tell us that for a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -49 \), \( c = 623 \), and \( d = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:
\[

Substituting this value into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This transforms the expression into:

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

Let \(t = \tan 20^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as:

\[
(t - \sqrt{3})(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1) = 0.

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1 = 0\) are:

\[
t = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm 4}{2} = \sqrt{3} \pm 2.
\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ\) is positive and less than \(\sqrt{3}\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 2} = -\sqrt{3} - 2\).

We also know that \(\tan 10^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\sqrt{3} - 2)} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \sqrt{3} + 2}{1 + 1 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{1 - 3 + 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}}{2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}} = 1\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ = 1\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ = (-\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 = 3 + 4\sqrt{3} + 4 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} - 2)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{1 + 3 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2 - \sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1}\right)^2 = (2 + \sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) = 15 + 8\sqrt{3}\).

Finally, we substitute this back into the expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 15 + 8\sqrt{3} = 18 + 8\sqrt{3}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one interior angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the total sum \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one interior angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of the interior angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the maximum value for the interior angle is \(180^\circ\). This gives us:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 180^\circ < 1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Simplify the inequalities:**
   \[
   (n-3) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve for \(n\):**
   First, solve the left inequality:
   \[
   (n-3) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-3 < \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Calculate the division:
   \[
   n-3 < 5.9444
   \]
   Add 3 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

   Next, solve the right inequality:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Calculate the division:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

7. **Conclusion:**
   The only integer value for \(n\) that satisfies both inequalities is \(n = 8\).

Therefore, the number of sides of the convex polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\

10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.

We see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since we are looking for the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we have:
\[ t = -6 + 23 = 17. \]
Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube) to get the total surface area.

First, let's find the side length of the cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one face of the cube. Since each face is a square with side length 1 foot, the area \( A \) of one face is:
\[ A = s^2 = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

Finally, we find the total surface area of the cube by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6):
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is:

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to determine what the radical conjugate is. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25

\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

Simplifying the components, we get:

Then, we find the magnitude of the direction vector \(\|\mathbf{b}\|\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar by the Angle Bisector Theorem.

x \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

Next, we need to use the fact that \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). This means that \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
\frac{42a}{a + b} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]
Solving for \(c\), we get:
\[
c = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) again using the expression \(\frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]
We already know from the earlier equation that:
\[
x = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]
Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

Since we know that the area of the trapezoid is 42 and the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\frac{a}{a + b}\) times the area of the trapezoid, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\frac{a}{a + b} \cdot 42\). However, we need to find the specific value of \(\frac{a}{a + b}\) to determine the area of \(\triangle ACD\).

Given the problem constraints and the properties of the trapezoid, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid when the trapezoid is symmetric and the angle bisector property holds. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

1. Identify the values of \(m\), \(n\), \(p\), and \(q\) from the given fractions.
2. Substitute these values into the operation formula.
3. Simplify the resulting expression.

Let's start by identifying the values:
- For \(\frac{7}{30}\), \(m = 7\) and \(n = 30\).
- For \(\frac{10}{21}\), \(p = 10\) and \(q = 21\).

Now, substitute these values into the operation formula:

Next, perform the multiplication:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7 \cdot 3}{10 \cdot 3} = \frac{7}{10}

Now, multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{7}{10}\):

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment crosses the other. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (the number of ways to rotate the circle) to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: As mentioned, the favorable arrangements are \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\) (and their cyclic permutations). There are 2 such arrangements for each pair of points that can be chosen to be \(A\) and \(B\) (with the remaining two points being \(C\) and \(D\)). Since there are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways to choose which two points will be \(A\) and \(B\) (and the remaining two will be \(C\) and \(D\)), and each pair of points can be arranged in 2 favorable ways, the total number of favorable arrangements is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 = 4

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Therefore, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   \[
   \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Express the area of the shaded region in terms of the angle \(\theta\):**
   The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. The area of each segment can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circular segment:
   \[
   \text{Area of a segment} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius of the circle and \(\theta\) is the central angle in radians.

   For the smaller circle with radius \(1\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the smaller segment} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta)
   \]

   For the larger circle with radius \(2\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger segment} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = 2 (\theta - \sin \theta)
   \]

   The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two segments:
   \[
   \text{Total shaded area} = \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin \theta) + 2 (\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{1}{2} \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta + 2\theta - 2\sin \theta = \frac{5}{2} \theta - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta
   \]

4. **Set up the equation and solve for \(\theta\):**
   We know that the total shaded area is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
   \[
   \frac{5}{2} \theta - \frac{5}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

   Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
   \[
   \theta - \sin \theta = \frac{\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **Solve the equation \(\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\):**
   This equation does not have a simple algebraic solution, so we need to use numerical methods or known values. By inspection or using a calculator, we find that:
   \[
   \theta \approx 2.0944 \text{ radians}
   \]

6. **Convert radians to degrees:**
   \[
   \theta \text{ in degrees} = \theta \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 2.0944 \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 120^\circ

"To determine how many valcový pohárov vody bude potreba na naplnenie guľovej nádrži s polomerom 6 cm, we need to calculate the volume of one valcový pohár and the volume of the guľové nádrž, and then find the ratio of these volumes.

First, let's calculate the volume of one valcový pohár. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the valcový pohár, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{pohár}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the guľové nádrž. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the guľové nádrž, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{nádrž}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from a board of 8 republikános and 6 demokratos, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one republikán and one demokrat, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that do not meet the condition (i.e., subcommittees with only republikános or only demokratos).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from 14 members (8 republikános and 6 demokratos):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only republikános. This is the number of ways to choose 5 republikános from 8:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only demokratos. This is the number of ways to choose 5 demokratos from 6:
\[

"Given three consecutive integers whose product is 120, we need to find the largest of these integers. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). According to the problem, their product is:

\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

We are also given that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24

This can be rewritten as:

\[

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[

To verify, we check the product and the division by the average:

\[

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x - 2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we choose \(x = 66\).

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

We can factor out \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the product becomes:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(BD = DC = x\). Since \(AD = 10\), it follows that \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta\) and \(\angle CDM = 90^\circ - \theta\).

In \(\triangle BDC\), we apply the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + DC^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot DC \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
(2x)^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(3\theta)
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
4x^2 = 2x^2 - 2x^2 \cos(3\theta)
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
2x^2 = -2x^2 \cos(3\theta)
\]
Dividing both sides by \(2x^2\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)), we get:
\[
1 = -\cos(3\theta)
\]
Thus, \(\cos(3\theta) = -1\). The angle whose cosine is \(-1\) is \(180^\circ\), so:
\[
3\theta = 180^\circ \implies \theta = 60^\circ
\]
Therefore, \(\angle BAC = 60^\circ\), and \(\triangle ABC\) is an equilateral triangle. In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal. Let the side length of the equilateral triangle be \(s\). Then \(BC = s\), and since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BM = MC = \frac{s}{2}\).

In \(\triangle ABM\), we apply the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
s^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2
\]
Simplifying, we have:
\[
s^2 = 121 + \frac{s^2}{4}
\]
Multiplying through by 4 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
4s^2 = 484 + s^2
\]
Subtracting \(s^2\) from both sides, we get:
\[
3s^2 = 484
\]
Dividing both sides by 3, we get:
\[
s^2 = \frac{484}{3}

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

This is a quadratic inequality. First, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

We can factor this quadratic equation:

\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have:

\[ y < 3 \]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[ x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Combining the Results

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true. Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is determined by the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), which is:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

"Given the equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables taken one at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which ročník has the number of mužské cestujúcich autobusom closest to \(135\%\) of the number ofženské cestujúcich autobusom, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number ofženské cestujúcich for each ročník and then compare it to the number of mužské cestujúcich.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number ofženské cestujúcich for each ročník:

1. **9th ročník:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 39.4\% = 1.35 \times 39.4 = 55.29\%
   \]
   The number of mužské cestujúcich is \(41.1\%\). The difference is:
   \[
   |55.29 - 41.1| = 14.19

2. **10th ročník:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 33.1\% = 1.35 \times 33.1 = 44.685\%
   \]
   The number of mužské cestujúcich is \(34.4\%\). The difference is:
   \[
   |44.685 - 34.4| = 10.285

3. **11th ročník:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 13.8\% = 1.35 \times 13.8 = 18.63\%

   The number of mužské cestujúcich is \(20.6\%\). The difference is:

4. **12th ročník:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 8.6\% = 1.35 \times 8.6 = 11.55\%
   \]
   The number of mužské cestujúcich is \(11.6\%\). The difference is:
   \[
   |11.55 - 11.6| = 0.05

- 11th ročník: \(1.97\)
- 12th ročník: \(0.05\)

The smallest difference is \(0.05\), which corresponds to the 12th ročník.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's determine the intervals where \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and where \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x - 9)(x + 9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x - 36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

The denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\), so these points are excluded from the solution set because they make the denominator zero.

We need to determine the sign of the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in each of the intervals where the numerator and the denominator are defined.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x < -9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(-)(-)}{(-)(-)} = \frac{+}{+} = +.\]
   So, the quotient is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(-9 < x < 0\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(-)(+)}{(-)(-)} = \frac{-}{+} = -.\]
   So, the quotient is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(0 < x < 9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(-)(+)}{(+)(-)} = \frac{-}{+} = -.\]
   So, the quotient is negative in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(9 < x < 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(+)(+)}{(+)(-)} = \frac{+}{-} = -.\]
   So, the quotient is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9), \quad x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
   The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x > 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 > 0\). Therefore, the quotient is:

   So, the quotient is positive in this interval.

Combining all the intervals where the quotient is negative, we get:
\[(-9, 0) \cup (0, 9) \cup (9, 36).\]

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The two straight sides of the rectangle each have a length \( l \), and the two semicircles each have a radius \( w/2 \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( w/2 \) is \( \pi w \), so the circumference of each semicircle is \( \frac{\pi w}{2} \). Therefore, the total length of the track is given by the equation:
\[
2l + 2 \left( \frac{\pi w}{2} \right) = 2l + \pi w = 400

We can solve this equation for \( l \):
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}

\[
A = l \cdot w = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2} \right) w = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0
\]
Solving for \( w \), we get:
\[
\pi w = 200

\[
w = \frac{200}{\pi}

Next, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( l \):

   - The hypotenuse \(RT\) is given as 5.
   - The side \(ST\) is given as 2.

2. **Use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):**
   The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(c\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(a\) and \(b\)):
   \[
   c^2 = a^2 + b^2

   Here, \(c = RT = 5\), \(a = ST = 2\), and \(b = RS\). Plugging in the known values, we get:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin \((0,0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the graph of the function \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\), we start by expressing the distance \(d\) as a function of \(x\). The distance formula gives us:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \(y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3)\right)^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the square root, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expanding \((x^2 - 3)^2\), we get:

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substituting this back into the expression for \(d\), we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)} = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \(d\), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, which is \(f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}\). We do this by taking the derivative of \(f(x)\) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0 \implies 2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us the critical points \(x = 0\), \(x = \sqrt{2}\), and \(x = -\sqrt{2}\). We evaluate \(f(x)\) at these points:

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum value of \(d\) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

"Given a regular octahedron with vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) and a point \(P\) such that the distances from \(P\) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex.

First, let's place the octahedron in a coordinate system. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be chosen as follows:
- \(A = (1, 0, 0)\)
- \(B = (-1, 0, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, 1, 0)\)
- \(D = (0, -1, 0)\)
- \(E = (0, 0, 1)\)
- \(F = (0, 0, -1)\)

Let the coordinates of point \(P\) be \((x, y, z)\). The distances from \(P\) to the vertices are given by the Euclidean distance formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]

We need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex, which is \(F = (0, 0, -1)\). This distance is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

To solve for \(x, y, z\), we start by squaring each of the given distance equations:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Now, subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2(10) = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 20 = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y - 35 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 140}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm 12}{2}
\]
\[
y = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -5
\]

Next, subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 2x = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 2(10) = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y + 20 = 72
\]
\[
y^2 + 2y - 52 = 0
\]

Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\):
\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 208}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{212}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{53}}{2}
\]
\[
y = -1 \pm \sqrt{53}
\]

Since \(y = 7\) or \(y = -5\) must satisfy both equations, we find that \(y = -5\) is the only consistent solution.

Finally, substitute \(x = 10\) and \(y = -5\) into the fifth equation:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
10^2 + (-5)^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
100 + 25 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
125 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
(z-1)^2 = -4
\]

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jenine's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jenine wants to hit the softball with the same force as Jack hits the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jenine's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball is:

"To determine how many identical digits appear in the base-7 and base-8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base-7 and base-8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base-7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base-7 representation:

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base-7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base-8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we calculate \( g(1) \):

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

Simplify the numerator:

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Now, we need to find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2\), \(t = 1 + i\), and \(t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"Let's define the cost of one ceruzka as \( x \) dollars and the cost of one large gumball as \( y \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. The cost of three ceruzies and one large gumball is $1.24:
   \[
   3x + y = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five ceruzies and one large gumball is $1.82:
   \[
   5x + y = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
2x = 0.58
\]
Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = 0.29

So, the cost of one ceruzka is $0.29. To convert this cost into cents, we multiply by 100:
\[

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\):
\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

Now, we identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in \(0.274\). The digits to the right of the decimal point are \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\). Among these, the last non-zero digit is \(4\).

Thus, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the rectangle \( ABCD \) is closer to the center \( O \) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \( ABCD \) in the coordinate plane with \( O \) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \( AB = a \) and \( AD = b \). The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \( A = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}) \)
- \( B = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}) \)
- \( C = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}) \)
- \( D = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}) \)

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is less than the distance from \( P \) to any vertex. The distance from \( P = (x, y) \) to \( O \) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \( P \) to vertex \( A \) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

For \( P \) to be closer to \( O \) than to \( A \), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \( x^2 + y^2 \) from both sides:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
\frac{a}{4}x - \frac{b}{4}y < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{16}
\]

This inequality represents a half-plane. Similarly, we can derive inequalities for the other vertices:
1. \( P \) closer to \( B \): \( \frac{a}{4}x + \frac{b}{4}y < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{16} \)
2. \( P \) closer to \( C \): \( -\frac{a}{4}x + \frac{b}{4}y < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{16} \)
3. \( P \) closer to \( D \): \( -\frac{a}{4}x - \frac{b}{4}y < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{16} \)

These four inequalities define four half-planes that intersect to form a smaller square inside the rectangle \( ABCD \). The vertices of this smaller square are the points where the lines intersect the sides of the rectangle.

To find the side length of the smaller square, we solve for the intersection points. For example, consider the intersection of \( \frac{a}{4}x - \frac{b}{4}y = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{16} \) with \( x = \frac{a}{2} \):
\[
\frac{a}{4} \left(\frac{a}{2}\right) - \frac{b}{4}y = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{16}
\]
\[
\frac{a^2}{8} - \frac{b}{4}y = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{16}
\]
Multiplying through by 16:
\[
2a^2 - 4by = -(a^2 + b^2)
\]
\[
2a^2 + a^2 + b^2 = 4by
\]
\[
3a^2 + b^2 = 4by
\]
\[
y = \frac{3a^2 + b^2}{4b}
\]

Similarly, we find the other intersection points. The side length of the smaller square is the distance between two adjacent intersection points. By symmetry and calculation, the side length of the smaller square is:
\[
\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} = \frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}
\]

The area of the smaller square is:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]

The area of the rectangle \( ABCD \) is:
\[
ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) is closer to \( O \) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}}{ab} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4ab}
\]

Given \( \frac{AB}{AD} = k \), we have \( \frac{a}{b} = k \) or \( a = kb \). Substituting \( a = kb \) into the probability expression:
\[
\frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{4(kb)b} = \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{4k b^2} = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{4k b^2} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
\[54 = 6q + r\]
where \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get:
\[r = 0\]

Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much peenies Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have left after converting their earnings into dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings in dollars:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's break it down step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total earnings in dollars is:
   \[
   \$126.59

2. **Convert the total earnings into cents:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total dollars by 100:

- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

So, the total sum of the scores is:

Now, let's perform the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Next, we add these products together to get the total sum of the scores:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the numbers in the third row, the columns, and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many more steps Martha prejde than Jim, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim prejde diagonálne cez the pole, so we use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the length and the width of the pole).

The length of the pole is 400 stôp and the width is 300 stôp. So, the distance Jim travels is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.

So the expression simplifies to:

\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
