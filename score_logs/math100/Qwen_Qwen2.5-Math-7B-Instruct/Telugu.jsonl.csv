"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying this equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( w \) is obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   z - c = 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i
   \]
   \[
   z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) (which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)) gives:
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Use the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} - 3i^2\frac{2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate \( w \) back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the result:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   w = 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i
   \]
   \[
   w = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of different paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 3x3 grid, where each move can only be either right or down, we can use combinatorial methods. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Identify the total number of moves required:**
   - To move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 3x3 grid, we need to make exactly 3 moves to the right (R) and 3 moves down (D). This is because the grid is 3 rows down and 3 columns to the right.

2. **Determine the number of unique sequences of moves:**
   - The problem now reduces to finding the number of unique sequences of 3 R's and 3 D's. This is a combinatorial problem where we need to choose 3 positions out of 6 for the R's (or equivalently, 3 positions out of 6 for the D's).

3. **Use the binomial coefficient:**
   - The number of ways to choose 3 positions out of 6 is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{6}{3}\). The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) is calculated as:
     \[
     \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
   - Here, \(n = 6\) and \(k = 3\). So, we have:
     \[
     \binom{6}{3} = \frac{6!}{3!3!}
     \]

4. **Calculate the factorials:**
   - \(6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720\)
   - \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\)

5. **Substitute the factorials into the binomial coefficient formula:**
   \[
   \binom{6}{3} = \frac{720}{6 \times 6} = \frac{720}{36} = 20
   \]

Therefore, the number of different paths from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of a 3x3 grid is \(\boxed{20}\).","[20, '20']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. For a term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Let's determine the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 (x^3)^2 = 100x^6
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 (x^2)^{-3} = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}
\]

The \(x^6\) and \(x^{-6}\) terms cancel each other out:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 1000 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, substitute these values back into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

Thus, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees of freedom for a pentagon that can be fixed in place by its center of mass and a point on its boundary, we need to consider the geometric constraints and the degrees of freedom of a rigid body in a plane.

A rigid body in a plane has 3 degrees of freedom: it can translate in the x-direction, translate in the y-direction, and rotate about the z-axis. However, if we fix the center of mass and a point on its boundary, we can reduce these degrees of freedom.

1. Fixing the center of mass means that the body cannot translate in the x-direction and the y-direction. This leaves us with only the rotation about the z-axis.
2. Fixing a point on the boundary means that the body cannot rotate about the z-axis unless the point on the boundary coincides with the center of mass. Since the point on the boundary is not necessarily the same as the center of mass, the body can still rotate about the z-axis.

However, if we fix the center of mass and a point on the boundary such that the point on the boundary is not the same as the center of mass, the body can only rotate about the z-axis in one specific direction (either clockwise or counterclockwise) to maintain its shape and size. This means that the body has only one degree of freedom left: the rotation about the z-axis.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees of freedom for a pentagon that can be fixed in place by its center of mass and a point on its boundary is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal connecting one pair of opposite vertices is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting the other pair of opposite vertices.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). We need to find the coordinates of \(D\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. This means we need to consider the possibility that \(D\) is not opposite \(A\) but opposite \(B\). Let's check the other possibility by assuming \(D\) is opposite \(B\).

If \(D\) is opposite \(B\), then the midpoint of \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of \(BD\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

This gives us the coordinates of \(D\) as \((11, -1)\).

Finally, we calculate \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 11 + (-1) = 10
\]

Thus, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",17,"[17, '17']",False

"To determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we start by factoring the denominator.

The denominator \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) can be factored as follows:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2). \]
Thus, the function can be rewritten as:
\[ f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}. \]

The vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. Therefore, we set the denominator equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. \]
This gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2. \]
So, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). This means \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we determine the horizontal asymptote by examining the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches infinity. For rational functions, the horizontal asymptote is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. Here, the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

Thus, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

"To find the smallest possible value of \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all 2x1 vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of the ratio \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express \(\|\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v}\|\) in terms of the components of \(\bold{v}\). If \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), then

\[
A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is

\[
\|A\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

The norm of \(\mathbf{v}\) is

\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of the expression

\[
\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}.
\]

Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then \( x = ty \), and the expression becomes

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4(ty)^2 + 12(ty)y + 13y^2}{(ty)^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2y^2 + 12ty^2 + 13y^2}{t^2y^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{y^2(4t^2 + 12t + 13)}{y^2(t^2 + 1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \).

Taking the derivative of \( g(t) \) with respect to \( t \), we get

\[
g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-6(2t^2 + 3t - 2)}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]

Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we solve the quadratic equation \( 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \), we get

\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \).

We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these critical points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):

\[
g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,
\]

\[
g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{4 \cdot 4 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,
\]

\[
\lim_{t \to \pm \infty} g(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4.
\]

The maximum value of \( g(t) \) is 16. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(t) = \sqrt{g(t)} \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

Thus, the smallest possible value of \( C \) is

我们需要找到 \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) 的值。首先，注意到由于 \( z^5 = 1 \)，我们有 \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) 和 \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \)。因此，表达式变为：

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.
2. Perform the subtraction in base 10.
3. Convert the result back to base 9.

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10.**

The number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10.**

Now, subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9.**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"Let's define the variables for the heights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees. Let \( T \) be the height of a treek, \( S \) be the height of a squig, and \( G \) be the height of a goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( 2T + 3S + G = 2T + S + 2G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S + G \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ 2T + 3S + G = 2T + S + 2G \]
Subtract \( 2T \) from both sides:
\[ 3S + G = S + 2G \]
Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ 2S + G = 2G \]
Subtract \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 2S = G \]
So, we have:
\[ G = 2S \]

Next, let's simplify the second equation:
\[ 2T + G = S + G \]
Subtract \( G \) from both sides:
\[ 2T = S \]
So, we have:
\[ S = 2T \]

Now we know that \( G = 2S \) and \( S = 2T \). Substituting \( S = 2T \) into \( G = 2S \), we get:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Now, we perform each multiplication:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we verify these values by substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the coefficient of \(t^2\) and \(t\) equations.

For the coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For the coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True

The formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \(r\) is the radius of the base of the cylinder and \(h\) is the height of the water. The rate of change of the volume with respect to time \(t\) is:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 0.1 \]

To find \(r^2\), we can divide both sides of the equation by \(\pi \cdot 0.1\):

\[ r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{\pi \cdot 0.1} = \frac{20}{0.1} = 200 \]

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both regions defined by \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(a > 0\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this region is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). For \(a < 0\), the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in this region is \(f(a) = a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the function is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the function is decreasing. The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at most once, the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) from the left (i.e., \(a^2 + 2a\)) must be greater than or equal to the minimum value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) from the right (i.e., \(a^3\)). Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:
\[a^2 + 2a \geq a^3.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]
To solve this inequality, we determine the roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We then test the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0\), so the inequality does not hold.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0\), so the inequality does not hold.

We also check the roots:
- For \(a = -1\): \((-1)(-1 - 2)(-1 + 1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a = 0\): \((0)(0 - 2)(0 + 1) = (0)(-2)(1) = 0 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.
- For \(a = 2\): \((2)(2 - 2)(2 + 1) = (2)(0)(3) = 0 \leq 0\), so the inequality holds.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 2]\). The maximum value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

### Completing the square for \( x \):
1. Start with the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 25 \) inside the equation:

### Completing the square for \( y \):
1. Start with the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \( 6 \), divide by 2 to get \( 3 \), and then square it to get \( 9 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 9 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (y + 3)^2 - 9

### Substitute back into the original equation:
Now, substitute the completed squares back into the original equation:
\[
x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0
\]
\[
(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
\]

### Combine like terms:
Combine the constant terms \(-25\) and \(-9\):
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
\]

### Isolate the squared terms:
Add \( 34 \) to both sides of the equation to isolate the squared terms:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
\]

### Compare with the standard form:
The standard form of a circle's equation is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \( r^2 = 34 - c \). We are given that the radius \( r \) is 1, so:
\[
r^2 = 1^2 = 1
\]

### Solve for \( c \):
Set \( 34 - c \) equal to 1 and solve for \( c \):
\[
34 - c = 1

\[
c = 34 - 1

\[
c = 33

First, we compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to find \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) satisfying \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). This gives us the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
We can factor out \(x\) from both sides:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.

This equation has two solutions: \(x = 0\) or \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). For \(x = 0\), we have \(f(0) = 0\), so \(f(f(0)) = 0\). This satisfies \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) = x\). Therefore, \(x = 0\) is not a solution we are looking for.

We now consider the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda x^3).
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 - 1 = 0.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^3 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this cubic equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) but does not have \(x = 0\) as a solution. We can test some specific values of \(\lambda\).

For \(\lambda = 2\), the equation becomes:
\[
-8x^3 + 10x^2 - 8x + 3 = 0.
\]
We can check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution:
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 10\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 10 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 8 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + \frac{5}{2} - 4 + 3 = 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution. Since \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), \(f(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)) = f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), so \(\lambda = 2\) is not a solution we are looking for.

For \(\lambda = 3\), the equation becomes:
\[
-27x^3 + 21x^2 - 9x + 8 = 0.
\]
We can check if \(x = \frac{2}{3}\) is a solution:
\[
-27\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 + 21\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 9\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 8 = -27 \cdot \frac{8}{27} + 21 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - 9 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 8 = -8 + \frac{84}{9} - 6 + 8 = -8 + \frac{28}{3} - 6 + 8 = \frac{-24 + 28 - 18 + 24}{3} = \frac{10}{3} \neq 0.

So, \(x = \frac{2}{3}\) is not a solution. We need to check other values.

\[
-64x^3 + 40x^2 - 16x + 15 = 0.

We can check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution:
\[
-64\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 40\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 15 = -64 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 40 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 16 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 15 = -8 + 10 - 8 + 15 = 15 \neq 0.

So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a solution. We need to check other values.

For \(\lambda = \sqrt{2}\), the equation becomes:
\[
-2\sqrt{2}x^3 + (4\sqrt{2} + 2)x^2 - 2\sqrt{2}x + 1 = 0.
\]
We can check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution:
\[
-2\sqrt{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + (4\sqrt{2} + 2)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 2\sqrt{2}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1 = -2\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{8} + (4\sqrt{2} + 2) \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 2\sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 1 = -\frac{\sqrt{2}}{4} + \sqrt{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{2} + 1 = \frac{3}{2} \neq 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a solution. We need to check other values.

For \(\lambda = \sqrt{3}\), the equation becomes:
\[
-3\sqrt{3}x^3 + (6\sqrt{3} + 3)x^2 - 3\sqrt{3}x + 2 = 0.

We can check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution:
\[
-3\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + (6\sqrt{3} + 3)\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 3\sqrt{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 2 = -3\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{8} + (6\sqrt{3} + 3) \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 3\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 2 = -\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{8} + \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{3}{4} - \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} + 2 = \frac{11}{4} \neq 0.

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given expression, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get:
\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ
\]
So the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get:
\[
\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ
\]
So the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\), to express the right-hand side in a different form. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ
\]
So we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities, \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Therefore, \(\theta = 120^\circ\) (since \(\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}\)).

"To determine the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ella"" such that no two identical letters are adjacent, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the letters and their frequencies:**
   - E: 2
   - L: 2
   - A: 1

2. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions:**
   The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a multiset is given by:
   \[
   \frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the total number of items to arrange, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct items.

   For ""ella"":
   \[
   n = 5, \quad n_1 = 2 \text{ (E)}, \quad n_2 = 2 \text{ (L)}, \quad n_3 = 1 \text{ (A)}
   \]
   So, the total number of arrangements is:
   \[
   \frac{5!}{2! \cdot 2! \cdot 1!} = \frac{120}{4 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{120}{8} = 15
   \]

3. **Subtract the number of arrangements where at least two identical letters are adjacent:**
   We will use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to count the arrangements where at least two identical letters are adjacent.

   **Case 1: Two E's are adjacent.**
   Treat the two E's as a single unit. This reduces the problem to arranging 4 units (EE, L, L, A).
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 1!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]

   **Case 2: Two L's are adjacent.**
   Treat the two L's as a single unit. This reduces the problem to arranging 4 units (E, E, LL, A).
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2! \cdot 1!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]

   **Case 3: Both pairs (E's and L's) are adjacent.**
   Treat both pairs as single units. This reduces the problem to arranging 3 units (EE, LL, A).
   \[
   \frac{3!}{1!} = 6
   \]

   Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, the number of arrangements where at least two identical letters are adjacent is:
   \[
   12 + 12 - 6 = 18
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of arrangements where no two identical letters are adjacent:**
   Subtract the number of arrangements where at least two identical letters are adjacent from the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   15 - 6 = 9
   \]

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in ""ella"" such that no two identical letters are adjacent is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",True

我们使用以下公式来找出 \(n!\) 中质数 \(p\) 的因子的次数：
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

这里， \(n = 42\) 且 \(p = 5\)。因此，我们需要计算：
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor + \cdots

\[

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the interior of the domain. To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} \sqrt{1 - x^2} = yx \]
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2 \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 + y^2 x^2 = y^2 x^2 \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can use the parametric equations \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \]
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta \]
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta \]
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = 1 \]

Therefore, the value of the function \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1. Since this is the maximum value we have found on the boundary and in the interior, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[

接下来，我们执行除法 \(21 \div 312500\)。为了使除法更容易，我们可以将分子和分母都乘以2，使分母成为10的幂。然而，一个更简单的方法是直接进行除法。

让我们逐步进行除法：

1. 将21除以312500。由于21小于312500，我们从21开始添加小数点和零，使其成为21.000000。
2. 312500 goes into 2100000 six times (since \(312500 \times 6 = 1875000\)). So, we write 6 in the decimal place and subtract 1875000 from 2100000, which gives us 225000.
3. Bring down the next 0 to make it 2250000. 312500 goes into 2250000 seven times (since \(312500 \times 7 = 2187500\)). So, we write 7 in the next decimal place and subtract 2187500 from 2250000, which gives us 62500.
4. Bring down the next 0 to make it 625000. 312500 goes into 625000 two times (since \(312500 \times 2 = 625000\)). So, we write 2 in the next decimal place and subtract 625000 from 625000, which gives us 0.

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{21}{312500}\) is \(0.0000672\).

"To determine the number of nickels in Hilary's piggy bank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the value of each type of coin.
2. Set up an equation based on the total value of the coins.
3. Solve the equation for the number of nickels.

First, let's identify the value of each type of coin:
- A quarter is worth 25 cents.
- A dime is worth 10 cents.
- A nickel is worth 5 cents.

Next, let's denote the number of quarters as \( q \), the number of dimes as \( d \), and the number of nickels as \( n \). According to the problem, the total value of all the coins is 75 cents. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 25q + 10d + 5n = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 5q + 2d + n = 15 \]

Since the problem does not provide specific numbers for the quarters and dimes, we need to find a combination of \( q \) and \( d \) that makes \( n \) a whole number. Let's test some possible values for \( q \) and \( d \):

1. If \( q = 0 \) and \( d = 0 \):
   \[ 5(0) + 2(0) + n = 15 \]
   \[ n = 15 \]

2. If \( q = 0 \) and \( d = 1 \):

   \[ n = 3 \]

8. If \( q = 0 \) and \( d = 7 \):
   \[ 5(0) + 2(7) + n = 15 \]

    \[ 5(1) + 2(3) + n = 15 \]
    \[ 11 + n = 15 \]

"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given diagram, we need to analyze the two shaded triangles and calculate their areas separately before summing them up.

### Step 1: Analyze the first shaded triangle
The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).

- **Base**: The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is \(2\) units.
- **Height**: The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is \(4\) units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the second shaded triangle
The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((2, 0)\).

- **Base**: The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((2, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\). To find this distance, we use the distance formula:
\[
\text{Base} = \sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17} \text{ units}
\]

- **Height**: The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to the line segment from \((2, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\). Since \((3, 4)\) is directly above \((2, 4)\), the height is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((2, 4)\), which is \(4\) units.

The area \(A_2\) of this triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{17} \times 4 = 2\sqrt{17} \text{ square units}

### Step 3: Sum the areas of the two shaded triangles
The total area \(A\) of the shaded regions is the sum of \(A_1\) and \(A_2\):
\[
A = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 2\sqrt{17}

Thus, the total area of the shaded regions is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of positive integer divisors of 450. Let's start by finding the prime factorization of 450.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 450 is even, so it is divisible by 2:
     \[
     450 \div 2 = 225
     \]
     Thus, \(450 = 2 \times 225\).
   - 225 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. It is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \(2 + 2 + 5 = 9\), which is divisible by 3):
     \[
     225 \div 3 = 75
     \]
     Thus, \(225 = 3 \times 75\).
   - 75 is divisible by 3 (sum of digits \(7 + 5 = 12\), which is divisible by 3):
     \[
     75 \div 3 = 25
     \]
     Thus, \(75 = 3 \times 25\).
   - 25 is divisible by 5:
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
     Thus, \(25 = 5 \times 5\).

Combining all these factors, we get the prime factorization of 450:
\[
450 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^2
\]

2. **Counting the Divisors:**
   To find the number of positive integer divisors of a number given its prime factorization \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \), we use the formula:
   \[
   (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1)
   \]

For \(450 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\):
- The exponent of 2 is 1.
- The exponent of 3 is 2.
- The exponent of 5 is 2.

Applying the formula:
\[
(1 + 1)(2 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 \times 3 \times 3 = 18

Therefore, the number of positive integer divisors of 450 is \(\boxed{18}\).","[18, '18']","11,\! 111,\! 111,\! 100","[100, '100']",False

Let's break this down step by step.

   The first number can be 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Therefore, there are 3 possible choices for the first number.

2. **Determine the choices for the second number:**
   The second number can be 1, 2, 3, or 4 modulo 5. Therefore, there are 4 possible choices for the second number.

   The third and fourth numbers can each be any number from 1 to 4. Therefore, there are 4 possible choices for each of the third and fourth numbers.

   Since the choices for each number are independent of each other, we multiply the number of choices for each position:

So the fraction becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

"To determine the shape of the region defined by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

1. **Cylindrical Coordinates**: In cylindrical coordinates, a point in space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
   - \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
   - \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
   - \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Equation \( z = c \)**: The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface defined by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \).

3. **Interpretation in 3D Space**: Since \( z \) is fixed at \( c \), the points \((r, \theta, c)\) can vary in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) coordinates. This means that \( r \) can take any value from 0 to \(\infty\) and \( \theta \) can take any value from \( 0 \) to \( 2\pi \).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \).

Given:
\[ f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \]
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) \]

Let \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) be the roots of \( f(x) \). Then, by the definition of \( g(x) \), the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that:
\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \]
This implies:
\[ f(x + 5) = 0 \]
Since \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), we have:
\[ x + 5 = r_1 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 5 = r_2 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 5 = r_3 \]

Solving for \( x \) in each case, we get:
\[ x = r_1 - 5 \]
\[ x = r_2 - 5 \]
\[ x = r_3 - 5 \]

Thus, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

Next, we use Vieta's formulas to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), Vieta's formulas tell us:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{a_2}{a_3} \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have:
\[ a_3 = 1 \]
\[ a_2 = -49 \]

Therefore, the sum of the roots \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) is:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49 \]

Now, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), which are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of these roots is:

Distributing the subtraction, we get:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 5 - 5 - 5 \]

Simplifying, we find:
\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 \]

Substituting the value of \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 \) from above, we get:

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the identity \(\tan 3x = \tan (60^\circ - 40^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 40^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 40^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 40^\circ = \tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 20^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.
\]

Using these identities, we can find that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
3 + 9 = 12.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\) and one of its interior angles is \(180^\circ - 30^\circ = 150^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   We are given that this sum is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
   \]

2. **Solve for \(n\):**
   First, divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   n-2 = 5.9444\ldots
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we round \(5.9444\ldots\) to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:
   \[
   n-2 = 6
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides to solve for \(n\):
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

3. **Verify the solution:**
   If the polygon has 8 sides, the sum of its interior angles is:
   \[
   (8-2) \times 180^\circ = 6 \times 180^\circ = 1080^\circ
   \]
   Since one of the interior angles is \(150^\circ\), the sum of the remaining 7 interior angles is:
   \[
   1080^\circ - 150^\circ = 930^\circ
   \]
   This is consistent with the problem statement, confirming that our solution is correct.

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"Given the conditions \(0 < t < 23\) and \(t+2\) is the modular inverse of \(t\) modulo 23, we need to find an odd positive integer \(t\) that satisfies this condition. This means that:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the congruence, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We need to solve this quadratic congruence. First, we use the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -1\). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the modular equivalent of \(\sqrt{2}\) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \(x\) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \(x\) from 1 to 11 (since \(x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23}\)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\
4^2 &\equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \\
5^2 &\equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \\
6^2 &\equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}, \\
7^2 &\equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}, \\
8^2 &\equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \\
9^2 &\equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \\
10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned}
\]

From the above calculations, we see that \(5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}\), so \(\sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23}\) or \(\sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}\). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 \equiv -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are asked to find an odd positive integer \(t\), we have \(t = 17\). We can verify this solution by checking that \(t+2\) is indeed the modular inverse of \(t\) modulo 23:

\[ t+2 = 17+2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

The verification confirms that \(t = 17\) is correct. Therefore, the odd positive integer \(t\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the sum of the surface areas of all the smaller cubes that make up the larger cube. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the side length of the larger cube:**
   The larger cube is made up of smaller cubes, each with a side length of 1 cm. Since the larger cube is a perfect cube, its side length must be an integer. Let's denote the side length of the larger cube by \( n \) cm. Therefore, the volume of the larger cube is \( n^3 \) cubic cm. Since each smaller cube has a volume of \( 1^3 = 1 \) cubic cm, the number of smaller cubes is \( n^3 \).

2. **Calculate the surface area of one smaller cube:**
   The surface area of one smaller cube with a side length of 1 cm is \( 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \) square cm.

3. **Calculate the total surface area of all the smaller cubes:**
   Since there are \( n^3 \) smaller cubes, the total surface area of all the smaller cubes is \( n^3 \times 6 = 6n^3 \) square cm.

4. **Determine the surface area of the larger cube:**
   The surface area of the larger cube with a side length of \( n \) cm is \( 6 \times n^2 \) square cm.

5. **Find the difference between the total surface area of the smaller cubes and the surface area of the larger cube:**
   The difference is \( 6n^3 - 6n^2 = 6n^2(n - 1) \) square cm.

6. **Given that the difference is 576 square cm:**
   We set up the equation \( 6n^2(n - 1) = 576 \). To solve for \( n \), we first divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   n^2(n - 1) = 96
   \]
   Next, we test integer values of \( n \) to find a solution:
   - If \( n = 4 \), then \( 4^2(4 - 1) = 16 \times 3 = 48 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 5 \), then \( 5^2(5 - 1) = 25 \times 4 = 100 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 6 \), then \( 6^2(6 - 1) = 36 \times 5 = 180 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.5 \), then \( 4.5^2(4.5 - 1) = 20.25 \times 3.5 = 70.875 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.8 \), then \( 4.8^2(4.8 - 1) = 23.04 \times 3.8 = 87.552 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.6 \), then \( 4.6^2(4.6 - 1) = 21.16 \times 3.6 = 76.176 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.7 \), then \( 4.7^2(4.7 - 1) = 22.09 \times 3.7 = 81.733 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.8 \), then \( 4.8^2(4.8 - 1) = 23.04 \times 3.8 = 87.552 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.9 \), then \( 4.9^2(4.9 - 1) = 24.01 \times 3.9 = 93.639 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.9 \), then \( 4.9^2(4.9 - 1) = 24.01 \times 3.9 = 93.639 \) (not 96).
   - If \( n = 4.9 \), then \( 4.9^2(4.9 - 1) = 24.01 \times 3.9 = 93.639 (not 96)
   - if n = 4.9 then 4.9^2(4.9-1) = 24.01(4.9-1) = 93.639 ( not 96)

Since \(\mathbf{b}_1\) and \(\mathbf{b}_2\) are parallel (or the same line), we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to use the distance formula for parallel lines.

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}_1\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}_1\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of integer coordinate points within the square defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that lie within this square.

The square is aligned with the coordinate axes, and its side length is the distance between \(x = 5\) and \(x = -5\), which is \(10\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of the points within the square (including the boundary) range from \(-5\) to \(5\). Similarly, the \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\).

To find the total number of integer coordinate points, we calculate the number of possible \(x\)-coordinates and the number of possible \(y\)-coordinates, and then multiply these two numbers together.

The number of integer \(x\)-coordinates from \(-5\) to \(5\) is:
\[5 - (-5) + 1 = 5 + 5 + 1 = 11\]

The number of integer \(y\)-coordinates from \(-4\) to \(4\) is:
\[4 - (-4) + 1 = 4 + 4 + 1 = 9\]

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}

To ensure that this solution is valid, we need to check that it satisfies the original equation and the domain of the original equation. The domain requires that \(3x - 1 > 0\), which means \(x > \frac{1}{3}\). Since \(\frac{9}{19} > \frac{1}{3}\), the solution is valid.

First, identify the values of \( m \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( q \) from the given fractions:

- For \( \frac{10}{21} \), \( p = 10 \) and \( q = 21 \).

Next, substitute these values into the operation formula:

"To determine the probability that two randomly chosen chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) from a circle intersect, we need to consider the geometric properties of the circle and the chords.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a circle with 5 points \(A, B, C, D, E\) on its circumference.
   - We need to find the probability that two randomly chosen chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Counting the Total Number of Chords:**
   - The number of ways to choose 2 points out of 5 to form a chord is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of points.
   \[
   \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
   \]
   So, there are 10 possible chords.

3. **Counting the Number of Pairs of Chords:**
   - The number of ways to choose 2 chords out of 10 is given by \( \binom{10}{2} \).
   \[
   \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45
   \]
   So, there are 45 possible pairs of chords.

4. **Determining the Number of Intersecting Pairs of Chords:**
   - For two chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A, B, C,\) and \(D\) must be arranged such that they form a quadrilateral with \(A\) and \(B\) on one diagonal and \(C\) and \(D\) on the other diagonal.
   - The number of ways to choose 4 points out of 5 to form a quadrilateral is given by \( \binom{5}{4} \).
   \[
   \binom{5}{4} = \frac{5!}{4!(5-4)!} = \frac{5}{1} = 5
   \]
   For each set of 4 points, there is exactly one way to pair them such that the chords intersect.
   Therefore, there are 5 pairs of intersecting chords.

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability that two randomly chosen chords intersect is the ratio of the number of intersecting pairs to the total number of pairs.
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of intersecting pairs}}{\text{Total number of pairs}} = \frac{5}{45} = \frac{1}{9}

Thus, the probability that two randomly chosen chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{9}}\).","[1/9, '\\frac{1}{9}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of \(\angle ADC\) given the areas of the regions formed by the two circles and the line segment \(AC\).

First, let's denote the radius of the smaller circle as \(r_1 = 1\) and the radius of the larger circle as \(r_2 = 2\). The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller circle} = \pi r_1^2 = \pi \cdot 1^2 = \pi
\]
The area of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of larger circle} = \pi r_2^2 = \pi \cdot 2^2 = 4\pi

The area of the region inside the smaller circle and outside the larger circle is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\). This region is a segment of the smaller circle minus a segment of the larger circle. Let's denote the central angle \(\angle ADC\) as \(\theta\) in radians.

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of sector of smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} r_1^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of sector of larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} r_2^2 \theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \theta = 2\theta
\]

The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} r_1^2 \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 1^2 \cdot \sin \theta = \frac{\sin \theta}{2}
\]
So, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of segment of smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{\sin \theta}{2} = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2}
\]

Similarly, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of segment of larger circle} = 2\theta - \frac{1}{2} r_2^2 \sin \theta = 2\theta - \frac{1}{2} \cdot 2^2 \cdot \sin \theta = 2\theta - 2\sin \theta
\]

The area of the region inside the smaller circle and outside the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of region} = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} - (2\theta - 2\sin \theta) = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} - 2\theta + 2\sin \theta = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta - 4\theta + 4\sin \theta}{2} = \frac{-3\theta + 3\sin \theta}{2} = \frac{3(\sin \theta - \theta)}{2}
\]
We are given that this area is \(\frac{5}{12}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3(\sin \theta - \theta)}{2} = \frac{5}{12}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 12, we get:
\[
18(\sin \theta - \theta) = 5

Dividing both sides by 18, we get:
\[

\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{9} \cdot \frac{180}{\pi} = \frac{2 \cdot 180}{9} = 40

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical bookcase. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the bookcase, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
V_{\text{bookcase}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}

Next, let's calculate the volume of one book. The diameter of each book is 6 cm, so the radius \( r \) of each book is half of the diameter, which is 3 cm. The height \( h \) of each book is 2 cm. Using the volume formula for a cylinder again, we get:
\[
V_{\text{book}} = \pi (3)^2 (2) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 2 = 18\pi \text{ cubic cm}

To find out how many books can fit into the bookcase, we divide the volume of the bookcase by the volume of one book:

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Multiplying these two expressions together, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so it simplifies to:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

We know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[

"Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \(x-1\), \(x\), and \(x+1\). According to the problem, the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(x-1) \cdot x \cdot (x+1) = 120
\]

We also know that when this product is divided by the sum of these three integers, the result is 24. The sum of the three integers is:

\[
(x-1) + x + (x+1) = 3x
\]

So, we can write the second equation as:

\[
\frac{(x-1) \cdot x \cdot (x+1)}{3x} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[
\frac{x(x^2-1)}{3x} = 24
\]

The \(x\) in the numerator and the denominator cancel each other out (assuming \(x \neq 0\)), so we have:

\[
\frac{x^2-1}{3} = 24
\]

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:

\[
x^2 - 1 = 72

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 = 73
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -9
\]

Since we are looking for positive integers, we take \(x = 9\). Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \(8\), \(9\), and \(10\). The largest of these integers is \(10\).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by recognizing that the expression inside the cube root can be simplified. Notice that \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) is a perfect square trinomial, which can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). Therefore, the equation becomes:

\[
\sqrt[3]{(x-2)^2} = 16
\]

Next, we eliminate the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 16^3
\]

We know that \(16^3 = 4096\), so the equation simplifies to:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

"To find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. We use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we can pair the cosines as follows:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).

We know that:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we know that \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

We are also given that \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), since \( D \) is on \( AM \), \( \angle BDC \) is an external angle to \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle CDM \). Since \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \) are congruent (by symmetry), \( \angle BDM = \angle CDM = \frac{3\theta}{2} \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), \( \angle BDM = \frac{3\theta}{2} \), \( \angle BMD = 90^\circ \), and \( BM = x \). Using the tangent function in \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\tan \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x.
\]

We also know that in \( \triangle ABM \), \( \angle AMB = 90^\circ \), \( AM = 11 \), and \( BM = x \). Using the tangent function in \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}.
\]

We use the triple angle identity for tangent, which states:
\[
\tan \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = \frac{3\tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) - \tan^3 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}{1 - 3\tan^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \tan \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = x \) and \( \tan \theta = \frac{x}{11} \). We can use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABC \) to find \( x \).

In \( \triangle ABC \), by the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \angle BAC.
\]
Since \( AB = AC \) and \( BC = 2x \), we have:
\[
(2x)^2 = AB^2 + AB^2 - 2 \cdot AB^2 \cdot \cos \theta,
\]
\[
4x^2 = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos \theta),
\]
\[
2x^2 = AB^2 (1 - \cos \theta).
\]

We also know that \( AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2 \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2)(1 - \cos \theta).
\]

Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \tan^2 \theta}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{x}{11} \right)^2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \frac{x^2}{121}}} = \frac{11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left( 1 - \frac{11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right),
\]
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left( \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} - 11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right),
\]
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left( \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} - 11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right),
\]
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left( \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} - 11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right),
\]
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left( \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} - 11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right),
\]
\[
2x^2 = (121 + x^2) \left( \frac{\sqrt{121 + x^2} - 11}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}} \right).

\]

Solving this equation, we find \( x = 11 \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x = 22 \) and \( AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 121} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2} \).

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[

"To find the median of the first 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by calculating \(3^7\):

The sum of the first \(n\) positive integers is given by the formula:

\[
\frac{n(n+1)}{2}
\]

For \(n = 27\), the sum of the first 27 positive integers is:

\[
\frac{27 \cdot 28}{2} = 378
\]

However, we are given that the sum of these 27 integers is 2187, which means these integers are not the first 27 positive integers. Instead, they are a set of 27 integers that sum to 2187. Since the problem does not specify the exact integers, we can assume they are distributed in a way that allows us to find the median.

The median of a set of 27 integers is the 14th smallest integer in the ordered list. To find the median, we need to determine the average value of these integers. The average value of the integers is:

\[
\frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]

Since the integers are distributed around this average, the median is likely to be close to 81. Given that the integers are positive and their sum is 2187, the most logical assumption is that the median is exactly 81. Therefore, the median of these 27 integers is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it into two parts and solve each part separately.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us the roots:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we discard the root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we need to solve:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),

which simplifies to:
\[

\]
or
\[

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:

which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,

or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[

\[
24 = sp.

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) will be equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the intervals where the expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative. We will consider the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\) and test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative and \((x + 9)\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative and \((x + 9)\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\). This means that \(RT\) is the hypotenuse, \(ST\) is the adjacent side to angle \(R\), and \(RS\) is the opposite side to angle \(R\).

Given:
- \(RT = 5\)
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)

Since \(\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), we can identify the opposite side to angle \(R\) as \(RS = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of \(ST\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
ST^2 = 21
\]
Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Since \(\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\), and the opposite side to angle \(T\) is \(ST = \sqrt{21}\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\), we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( d \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \( d \) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \( d \), it is equivalent to minimize \( d^2 \) (since the square root function is increasing). Let \( f(x) = d^2 \):

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we identify \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \) is a potential solution. However, we also need to check if there is a solution for \( x > 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are the factors of \(-6\) divided by the factors of \(-1\), which are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \).

Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution.

Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \neq 0 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root.

Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \neq 0 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root.

Since we have already found that \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \) is a solution for \( x \leq 3 \), we do not need to check further.

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the other vertex of the cube, we start by identifying the coordinates of the vertices of the cube. Let's place the cube in a 3-dimensional coordinate system with one vertex at the origin \((0,0,0)\) and the opposite vertex at \((2,2,2)\). The vertices of the cube are:
\[
A = (0,0,0), \quad B = (2,0,0), \quad C = (2,2,0), \quad D = (0,2,0), \quad E = (0,0,2), \quad F = (2,0,2), \quad G = (2,2,2), \quad H = (0,2,2)
\]
We are given the distances from point \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) as 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the vertex \( G \).

Let the coordinates of point \( P \) be \((x, y, z)\). The distance from \( P \) to a vertex \((a, b, c)\) is given by the formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2}
\]
Using the given distances, we can write the following equations:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3 \implies x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7 \implies (x-2)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2} = 8 \implies (x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2} = 9 \implies x^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2 = 81

\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-2)^2} = 11 \implies x^2 + y^2 + (z-2)^2 = 121
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x-2)^2 + y^2 + (z-2)^2} = 11 \implies (x-2)^2 + y^2 + (z-2)^2 = 121
\]

We now have six equations. To find \( x, y, \) and \( z \), we can subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x-2)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 49 - 9 \implies x^2 - 4x + 4 - x^2 = 40 \implies -4x + 4 = 40 \implies -4x = 36 \implies x = -9
\]
However, this value of \( x \) is not possible since \( x \) must be between 0 and 2. Let's try another approach by subtracting the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 81 - 9 \implies y^2 - 4y + 4 - y^2 = 72 \implies -4y + 4 = 72 \implies -4y = 68 \implies y = -17

Again, this value of \( y \) is not possible. Let's try another approach by subtracting the first equation from the fifth:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-2)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 121 - 9 \implies z^2 - 4z + 4 - z^2 = 112 \implies -4z + 4 = 112 \implies -4z = 108 \implies z = -27
\]
Again, this value of \( z \) is not possible. Let's try another approach by subtracting the second equation from the third:
\[
(x-2)^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2 - ((x-2)^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 64 - 49 \implies (y-2)^2 - y^2 = 15 \implies y^2 - 4y + 4 - y^2 = 15 \implies -4y + 4 = 15 \implies -4y = 11 \implies y = -\frac{11}{4}
\]
This value of \( y \) is not possible. Let's try another approach by subtracting the second equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y-2)^2 + z^2 - ((x-2)^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 81 - 49 \implies x^2 - 4x + 4 - x^2 = 32 \implies -4x + 4 = 32 \implies -4x = 28 \implies x = -7
\]
This value of \( x \) is not possible. Let's try another approach by subtracting the second equation from the fifth:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-2)^2 - ((x-2)^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 121 - 49 \implies x^2 + z^2 - 4z + 4 - x^2 - z^2 = 72 \implies -4z + 4 = 72 \implies -4z = 68 \implies z = -17

This value of \( z \) is not possible. Let's try another approach by subtracting the second equation from the sixth:

"To determine the ratio of the rate of change of the velocity of Jena's cart to the rate of change of the velocity of Jake's cart, we need to use the principle of conservation of momentum. According to this principle, the total momentum of a closed system remains constant if no external forces act on it.

Let's denote:
- \( m_J \) as the mass of Jena's cart,
- \( m_A \) as the mass of Jake's cart,
- \( v_J \) as the velocity of Jena's cart,
- \( v_A \) as the velocity of Jake's cart.

Given:
- \( m_J = 200 \) g,
- \( m_A = 150 \) g,
- The initial velocities of both carts are zero (since they start from rest).

When Jena applies a force to Jake's cart, the total momentum of the system must remain zero because no external forces are acting on the system. Therefore, the momentum of Jena's cart must be equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to the momentum of Jake's cart.

The momentum of Jena's cart is given by:
\[ p_J = m_J v_J \]

The momentum of Jake's cart is given by:
\[ p_A = m_A v_A \]

Since the total momentum is zero:
\[ p_J + p_A = 0 \]

Substituting the expressions for momentum:
\[ m_J v_J + m_A v_A = 0 \]

Rearranging to solve for the ratio \( \frac{v_J}{v_A} \):
\[ m_J v_J = -m_A v_A \]
\[ \frac{v_J}{v_A} = -\frac{m_A}{m_J} \]

Substituting the given masses:
\[ \frac{v_J}{v_A} = -\frac{150 \text{ g}}{200 \text{ g}} \]
\[ \frac{v_J}{v_A} = -\frac{3}{4} \]

The negative sign indicates that the velocities are in opposite directions. Since we are asked for the ratio of the rate of change of the velocity of Jena's cart to the rate of change of the velocity of Jake's cart, we take the absolute value of the ratio:
\[ \left| \frac{v_J}{v_A} \right| = \frac{3}{4} \]

   - There are 6 prime ministers.
   - There are 4 vice prime ministers.
   - There are 2 prime ministers.

2. **Determine the distribution constraints:**
   - Each prime minister can give chappatils to 2 other prime ministers.
   - Each vice prime minister can give chappatils to 1 prime minister.
   - Each prime minister can give chappatils to 1 vice prime minister.
   - Each vice prime minister can give chappatils to 2 other vice prime ministers.

3. **Calculate the total number of chappatils given by prime ministers:**
   - Each of the 6 prime ministers can give chappatils to 2 other prime ministers, so the total number of chappatils given by prime ministers to other prime ministers is \(6 \times 2 = 12\).
   - Each of the 2 prime ministers can give chappatils to 1 vice prime minister, so the total number of chappatils given by prime ministers to vice prime ministers is \(2 \times 1 = 2\).
   - Therefore, the total number of chappatils given by prime ministers is \(12 + 2 = 14\).

4. **Calculate the total number of chappatils given by vice prime ministers:**
   - Each of the 4 vice prime ministers can give chappatils to 1 prime minister, so the total number of chappatils given by vice prime ministers to prime ministers is \(4 \times 1 = 4\).
   - Each of the 4 vice prime ministers can give chappatils to 2 other vice prime ministers, so the total number of chappatils given by vice prime ministers to other vice prime ministers is \(4 \times 2 = 8\).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:

The vertical distance between a point \((x_1, y_1)\) and a point \((x_2, y_2)\) on a line is given by the absolute difference in their \(y\)-coordinates, i.e., \(|y_1 - y_2|\).

For the point \((6, 0)\) and a point \((x, y)\) on the line \(y = 2x - 2\), the vertical distance is:
\[ |0 - (2x - 2)| = |2 - 2x| = 2|1 - x|. \]

The expression \(2|1 - x|\) represents the vertical distance as a function of \(x\). To maximize this distance, we need to maximize the expression \(|1 - x|\). The absolute value function \(|1 - x|\) is maximized when \(x\) is as far away from 1 as possible. However, since there is no restriction on the value of \(x\), the distance can theoretically be made arbitrarily large. But if we are looking for the maximum vertical distance in a practical sense, we need to consider the context or any constraints given in the problem. If there are no constraints, the maximum vertical distance is unbounded.

However, if we interpret the problem as finding the vertical distance from the point to the line at a specific point on the line, we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

a + b + c = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

接下来，我们考虑这些表达式的乘积：
\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
展开这个乘积，我们得到：
\[
abc = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1^2\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2^2\alpha_3\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2.
\]
利用 \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)，我们可以简化表达式为：
\[
abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot 0 = 4.
\]

由于 \(a + b + c = 0\) 和 \(abc = 4\)，且根是复数，表达式 \(a\)，\(b\)，和 \(c\) 必须是方程 \(t^3 - 4 = 0\) 的根。这个方程的根是 \(2^{1/3}\)，\(-2^{1/3}\)，和 \(2^{1/3}e^{2\pi i / 3}\)。然而，由于我们处理的是实数多项式，根必须是实数或成对出现。因此，根必须是 \(2^{1/3}\)，\(-2^{1/3}\)，和 \(2^{1/3}\)。

因此，集合 \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) 是 \(\{2, -1, -1\}\)。

"Let's define the cost of one pen as \( p \) dollars and the cost of one eraser as \( e \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

2. The cost of five pens and one eraser is $1.82:

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's do the division step by step.

1. **Set up the division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. Since 137 is less than 500, we will add a decimal point and some zeros to 137 to make the division possible.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - \(500\) goes into \(1370\) (which is \(137\) with an added zero) \(2\) times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\).
   - Subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
   - Bring down another zero to make it \(3700\).
   - \(500\) goes into \(3700\) \(7\) times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\).
   - Subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
   - Bring down another zero to make it \(2000\).
   - \(500\) goes into \(2000\) \(4\) times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\).
   - Subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

3. **Identify the place values**:
   - The digit \(2\) is in the tenths place.
   - The digit \(7\) is in the hundredths place.
   - The digit \(4\) is in the thousandths place.

4. **Determine the place value of the underlined digit**:
   - The underlined digit is \(4\), which is in the thousandths place.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the square \( ABCD \) is closer to the center \( O \) than to any of the four vertices \( A, B, C, \) or \( D \).

First, let's consider the geometry of the square and the distances from a point \( P \) to the center \( O \) and the vertices. The center \( O \) of the square is the midpoint of both the diagonals, and the distance from \( O \) to any vertex is the same. If we place the square in the coordinate plane with \( O \) at the origin \((0,0)\), then the vertices are at \((a,a)\), \((a,-a)\), \((-a,a)\), and \((-a,-a)\) for some side length \( 2a \).

A point \( P \) is closer to \( O \) than to any vertex if the distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is less than the distance from \( P \) to any vertex. The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is given by \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and the distance from \( P \) to any vertex is given by \( \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-a)^2} \) (or similarly for the other vertices).

The condition for \( P \) to be closer to \( O \) than to any vertex is:
\[ \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-a)^2} \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < (x-a)^2 + (y-a)^2 \]
Expanding the right side, we have:
\[ x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2ay + a^2 \]
Simplifying, we get:
\[ 0 < -2ax + 2a^2 - 2ay \]
\[ 2ax + 2ay < 2a^2 \]
\[ x + y < a \]

Similarly, we can derive the conditions for \( P \) to be closer to \( O \) than to the other vertices:
\[ x - y < a \]
\[ -x + y < a \]
\[ -x - y < a \]

These four inequalities describe a square centered at \( O \) with side length \( a \). The area of this smaller square is \( a^2 \), and the area of the original square is \( (2a)^2 = 4a^2 \).

The probability that a randomly chosen point \( P \) inside the original square is closer to \( O \) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the original square:
\[ \frac{a^2}{4a^2} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Therefore, the probability is:

"To solve the problem \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Let's go through the steps in detail:

1. **Perform the Division**: Divide 54 by 6.

   \]
   This means that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9.

2. **Identify the Remainder**: Since 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9 and there is no remainder left over (because 9 times 6 equals 54), the remainder is 0.

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

1. **Evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \).
     \[
     \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047
     \]
   - Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second piece of the piecewise function:
     \[
     f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil
     \]
   - The ceiling function \( \lceil x \rceil \) gives the smallest integer greater than or equal to \( x \). Therefore:
     \[
     \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2
     \]

2. **Evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( \sqrt{45} \).
     \[
     \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \times 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 6.708
     \]
   - Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function:
     \[
     f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor
     \]
   - The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Therefore:
     \[
     \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6
     \]

3. **Evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):**
   - First, determine the value of \( 8^{2/3} \).
     \[
     8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^{3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4
     \]
   - Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first piece of the piecewise function:
     \[
     f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor
     \]
   - The floor function \( \lfloor x \rfloor \) gives the largest integer less than or equal to \( x \). Therefore:
     \[
     \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4
     \]

4. **Sum the results:**
   \[
   f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide it by the total number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score for each group of students:

- For the 8 students who scored 90, the total score is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- For the 2 students who scored 100, the total score is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Next, we add up the total scores from all the groups to get the overall total score:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

"To solve for \( n \) in the given grid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row is equal to the sum of the numbers in each column. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in each row and each column.

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sum of the numbers in each row is equal to the sum of the numbers in each column, we can set the sums equal to each other. We see that the sums of the rows and columns are already equal, so we don't need to solve any further equations. However, we can verify that the sums are consistent by ensuring that the expressions for the sums are indeed equal.

From the calculations, we see that the sum of each row and each column is \(2n + 1\) and \(3n - 6\). Since these sums must be equal, we can set up the equation:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \(2n\) from both sides:
\[
1 = n - 6

Then, we add 6 to both sides:

1. Calculate the area of Jimeter's land.
2. Calculate the area of Martha's land.
3. Add the two areas together to find the total area of the combined land.

First, let's calculate the area of Jimeter's land. Jimeter's land is a square with a side length of 300 units. The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
\[
A = \text{side length}^2
\]
So, the area of Jimeter's land is:

A_{\text{Jimeter}} = 300^2 = 90000 \text{ square units}

Next, let's calculate the area of Martha's land. Martha's land is a square with a side length of 400 units. Using the same formula for the area of a square, the area of Martha's land is:
\[
A_{\text{Martha}} = 400^2 = 160000 \text{ square units}
\]

Now, we add the areas of Jimeter's and Martha's land to find the total area of the combined land:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_{\text{Jimeter}} + A_{\text{Martha}} = 90000 + 160000 = 250000 \text{ square units}

"Given that \(\omega\) is a cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The other property of cube roots of unity is that \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the two fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Using the property \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1

- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -4)\)
