"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of the rotation is:
\[
\boxed{6 - 5i}

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify each part of the term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 (x^3)^2 = 100x^6
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 (x^2)^{-3} = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}
\]

Combining these results, we get:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100x^6 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot x^6 \cdot x^{-6} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} \cdot 1 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the residue of \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) when divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, multiply the numbers:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

So,

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To determine the minimum number of degrees that a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions where the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry position is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate the angle of rotation as follows:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \) instead. The midpoint of \( AB \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

The midpoint of \( CD \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The magnitude of \(A\mathbf{v}\) is
\[
\|A\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]
The magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}\) is
\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of the expression
\[
\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}.
\]
Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then \( x = ty \), and the expression becomes
\[
\sqrt{\frac{4(ty)^2 + 12(ty)y + 13y^2}{(ty)^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2y^2 + 12ty^2 + 13y^2}{t^2y^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{y^2(4t^2 + 12t + 13)}{y^2(t^2 + 1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}}.
\]
We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \). We take the derivative of \( g(t) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[
g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]
Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we get
\[
-12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]
This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \). We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):
\[
g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,
\]
\[
g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,
\]
\[
\lim_{t \to \pm \infty} g(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4.
\]
The maximum value of \( g(t) \) is 16, so the maximum value of \( f(t) \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is
\[
\boxed{4}.

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we can follow these steps:

1. Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\).
2. Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).
3. Convert the result back to base \(9\).

**Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base \(10\).**

The base \(9\) number \(58_9\) can be expanded as:
\[58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}.\]

**Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base \(10\).**

The base \(9\) number \(18_9\) can be expanded as:
\[18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}.\]

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base \(10\).**

Now, subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:
\[53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}.\]

**Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base \(9\).**

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base \(9\), we divide \(36\) by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
\[36 \div 9 = 4 \text{ with a remainder of } 0.\]
So, \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of a squig. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Deu treeks pesen tancom three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   2t = 3s + g
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

We need to find the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of a squig, i.e., we need to solve for \( t \) in terms of \( s \). First, we can use the second equation to express \( g \) in terms of \( t \) and \( s \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
2t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
2t = 3s + s - 2t

Combine like terms:
\[

\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides of the equation:
\[
4t = 4s

Divide both sides by 4:
\[
t = s

This tells us that the weight of one treek is equal to the weight of one squig. Therefore, the weight of two treeks is:

So, the weight of two treeks is equal to the weight of one squig. The answer is:

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3

\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \(a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these results:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set up the following system of equations by comparing the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\):

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6

\[
a = -3

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical diposition, we start by analyzing the given information. The diposition is being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the diposition.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Since the diposition is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]

We are also given that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4
\]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substitute the given values \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) into the equation:

Simplify the equation by dividing both sides by \(\pi\):

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the two pieces of the function.

Therefore, we need:

To solve this inequality, we rearrange it:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
We factor out \(a\):
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
We factor the quadratic expression:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]

We determine the roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[(-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[(-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[(1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[(3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0.\]

We also check the roots:
- For \(a = -1\):
  \[(-1)(-1 - 2)(-1 + 1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0 \leq 0.\]

- For \(a = 0\):

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 2]\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.

This gives us two solutions:

For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).
For \(x = 0\) to be a solution, it must not be a fixed point of period 2, so we need to check if \(f(0) = 0\), which is true. Therefore, \(x = 0\) is not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\).

Now, we need to solve the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). Let's expand and simplify:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda x^3).
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 - 1 = 0 \implies -\lambda^3 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this cubic equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). By inspection, we can see that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\), so it cannot be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to check if there are other solutions.

By analyzing the behavior of the function and the properties of cubic equations, we find that the only values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy the condition are \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2\), and we can verify that \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a solution \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) such that \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2}\) is not true.

\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, the original expression for \(\tan \theta\) is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\), to simplify this expression. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the tangent of a specific angle. By inspection or using known trigonometric values, we find that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, \(\theta = 85^\circ\). Therefore, the mesura in graus de l'angle positiu més petit \(\theta\) per a ell is:

"To determine the number of ways to order the letters of the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, we need to calculate \( 7! \) and \( 3! \):

\[

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to order the letters of the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) on the domain \(-1 \le x, y \le 1\), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then the other variable must be 0 because the square root terms would otherwise be undefined or zero. So, we evaluate \( f \) at these points:
\[ f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1, \]
\[ f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1. \]
Thus, \( f(x, y) = 1 \) on the boundary where either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \).

Next, we consider the interior of the domain. To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[ f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}, \]
\[ f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting \( f_x = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 = xy, \]
\[ xy + y^2 = 1, \]
\[ y(x + y) = 1. \]
Similarly, setting \( f_y = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 = yx, \]
\[ yx + x^2 = 1, \]
\[ x(y + x) = 1. \]
From these two equations, we see that \( y(x + y) = x(y + x) \), which implies \( x = y \) (since \( x + y \neq 0 \) in the interior of the domain). Substituting \( x = y \) into either equation, we get:
\[ x(x + x) = 1, \]
\[ 2x^2 = 1, \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1}{2}, \]
\[ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Thus, the critical points are \( \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \) and \( \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \). We evaluate \( f \) at these points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} + -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2} = -1. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid \(G\) to the base \(BC\) to the total height from vertex \(A\) to \(BC\). This ratio is \(1:3\) because \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, and the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is one-third of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \((1/3)^2 = 1/9\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{1}{9} \times 144 = 16.

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the median \(BE\) into a ratio of 2:1. This means that \(BG:GE = 2:1\). Triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(BEC\) with a similarity ratio of \(1:3\). The area ratio of triangle \(ENG\) to triangle \(BEC\) is \((1/3)^2 = 1/9\).

The area of triangle \(BEC\) is half the area of triangle \(ABC\) because \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(BEC\) is:
\[

Since the area of triangle \(ENG\) is \(\frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(BEC\), we have:

Since all these values of \( n \) satisfy the condition that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, and the problem does not specify a unique value for \( n \), the smallest possible value of \( n \) is 2.

"To determine how many níquels La Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things:
1. The total number of monades is 11.
2. The total value of the monades is 75 cents.

We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + n - d - n = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[ 4 + n = 11 \]
\[ n = 11 - 4 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we first identify the six prime numbers: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

An even sum occurs if both numbers chosen are either even or both are odd. Let's count the number of even and odd prime numbers in the set:
- Even prime numbers: \(2\) (1 number)
- Odd prime numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\) (5 numbers)

Next, we calculate the total number of ways Paul and Jesse can choose their numbers. Since each of them chooses one number out of six, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even:
1. Both numbers are even: There is only 1 even number, so the number of ways to choose two even numbers is:
\[

\]
2. Both numbers are odd: There are 5 odd numbers, so the number of ways to choose two odd numbers is:

\]

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[

The probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the two shaded triangles.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Area of the First Triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number are only zeros and ones, the number must end in at least two zeros to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must be of the form \(111\ldots1100\).

Next, we need to ensure that the number \(111\ldots1100\) has at least one factor of 2 and two factors of 3. Since the number ends in 00, it is already divisible by 2. Now, we need to check the divisibility by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \(111\ldots1100\) is the number of ones in the number. Let's denote the number of ones by \(n\). Then the sum of the digits is \(n\), and we need \(n\) to be divisible by 3.

The smallest number of ones that is divisible by 3 is 3. Therefore, the smallest number of the form \(111\ldots1100\) that is divisible by 450 is \(11100\).

To confirm, let's check the divisibility:
- \(11100\) ends in 00, so it is divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of \(11100\) is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.
- \(11100\) ends in 00, so it is divisible by 5.

"To determine the probability that the fitza is placed in a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to analyze the possible outcomes and the conditions given.

First, let's identify the numbers on the roda and the corresponding residues when divided by 4 and 5. The roda has the numbers 1 through 8. When a number is divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0. However, since the roda does not have the number 0, the possible remainders are 1, 2, and 3. Similarly, when a number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, and we are given that the fitza is placed in the column corresponding to the remainder when the first number is divided by 4 and the row corresponding to the remainder when the second number is divided by 5. The shaded squares on the chessboard are those in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, and 7th rows and columns.

We need to find the probability that the fitza is placed in one of these shaded squares. There are 4 shaded rows and 4 shaded columns, so there are \(4 \times 4 = 16\) shaded squares on the chessboard. The total number of possible outcomes when the roda is spun twice is \(8 \times 8 = 64\).

Now, let's count the number of favorable outcomes. For the fitza to be placed in a shaded square, the remainder when the first number is divided by 4 must be 1, 3 (since these correspond to the 1st and 3rd columns), and the remainder when the second number is divided by 5 must be 1, 3 (since these correspond to the 1st and 3rd rows). There are 2 choices for the remainder when the first number is divided by 4 (1 or 3) and 2 choices for the remainder when the second number is divided by 5 (1 or 3). Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

The probability that the fitza is placed in a shaded square is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the form described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:

- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

First, we need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). By definition, \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). We substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015
\]

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 5^2 + 5^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125

\[

\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115

Now, substitute these expanded forms back into the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[

\]

Combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

This implies that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

First, expand the left-hand side:
\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula:
\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[
t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the square root of 2 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can use the method of successive squaring to find \( x \). We test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

\[

\]
\[

\[

We find that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

Substitute \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) back into the expression for \( t \):
\[
t = -1 \pm 5
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:
\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4

\[
t = -1 - 5 = -6

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \).

Thus, the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area of the cube by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces.

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \]
So, the side length of the cube is 1 foot.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found, we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \]
So, the area of one face of the cube is 1 square foot.

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \]
So, the total surface area of the cube is 6 square feet.

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate radical, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we calculate the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

We now calculate the squares:

\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):

\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix}.
\]

Using the determinant formula for the cross product, we get:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying each component:

\[
\mathbf{i}((-45) - (-14)) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) = \mathbf{i}(-31),
\]
\[
-\mathbf{j}((10) - (16)) = -\mathbf{j}(10 - 16) = -\mathbf{j}(-6) = \mathbf{j}(6),
\]
\[
\mathbf{k}((14) - (72)) = \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{k}(-58).
\]

Thus, the cross product is:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates are strictly inside the rectangular region with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that lie within the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of any point strictly inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. The possible integer values for \(x\) are:

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}
\]
\[
(k\mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = k(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v})
\]

Applying these properties, we get:

\[

\]

Next, we distribute each cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}

3. Sum the total costs from all countries.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of stamps to find the average price.

Let's start with the number of stamps from each country in the 1970s:

- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

Next, we calculate the total cost of the stamps from each country:

- Brazil: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 6 \text{ cèntims/stamp} = 72 \text{ cèntims}\)
- France: \(12 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cèntims/stamp} = 48 \text{ cèntims}\)
- Peru: \(6 \text{ stamps} \times 4 \text{ cèntims/stamp} = 24 \text{ cèntims}\)
- Spain: \(13 \text{ stamps} \times 5 \text{ cèntims/stamp} = 65 \text{ cèntims}\)

Now, we sum the total costs from all countries:

\[72 \text{ cèntims} + 48 \text{ cèntims} + 24 \text{ cèntims} + 65 \text{ cèntims} = 209 \text{ cèntims}\]

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) have the same height \(c\) and the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\) is the same as the ratio of their areas. Therefore, the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are equal:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = [\triangle ABC]
\]
Since the total area of the trapezoid is 42, we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

   Simplify the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{19}}}{\frac{\sqrt{8}}{\sqrt{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the operation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( m \) and \( p \):

\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the multiplication by canceling out the common factor between 70 and 30. The greatest common divisor of 70 and 30 is 10. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (for the rotations) and by 2 (for the reflections). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we are not considering the specific order of the points relative to each other. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and then the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This gives us:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]
   However, each pair of points can be arranged in 2 ways (either \(AB\) or \(BA\), and either \(CD\) or \(DC\)), so we need to divide by 2 to avoid overcounting:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   But this is still incorrect because we are not considering the specific order of the points relative to each other. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and then the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This gives us:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following two ways: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). There are 2 such arrangements.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   \[
   \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Express the area of the shaded region in terms of the angle \(\theta\):**
   The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. The area of each segment can be calculated using the formula for the area of a circular segment:
   \[
   \text{Area of a segment} = \text{Area of the sector} - \text{Area of the triangle}
   \]

4. **Calculate the area of the sector of the larger circle:**
   The area of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
   \]
   For the larger circle with radius \(2\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
   \]

5. **Calculate the area of the triangle in the larger circle:**
   The triangle formed by the radii and the chord is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length \(2\) and an included angle \(\theta\). The area of this triangle can be found using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta)

   For the larger circle with radius \(2\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle in the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)

6. **Calculate the area of the segment of the larger circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
   \]

7. **Calculate the area of the sector of the smaller circle:**
   The area of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
   \]
   For the smaller circle with radius \(1\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
   \]

8. **Calculate the area of the triangle in the smaller circle:**
   The triangle formed by the radii and the chord is an isosceles triangle with two sides of length \(1\) and an included angle \(\theta\). The area of this triangle can be found using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \sin(\theta)
   \]
   For the smaller circle with radius \(1\):
   \[
   \text{Area of the triangle in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
   \]

9. **Calculate the area of the segment of the smaller circle:**
   \[
   \text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
   \]

10. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded region:**
    The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments of both circles:
    \[
    \text{Total area of the shaded region} = (2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right)
    \]
    Simplify the equation:
    \[
    \text{Total area of the shaded region} = 2\theta + \frac{1}{2}\theta - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta)
    \]

11. **Set the total area equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\) and solve for \(\theta\):**
    \[
    \frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
    \]
    Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
    \[
    \theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}

12. **Solve the equation \(\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}\):**
    By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) satisfies the equation.

13. **Convert the angle from radians to degrees:**
    \[
    \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical vases are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical vase and the spherical tank, and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of the vase.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical vase. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical vase, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical vases are required to fill the spherical tank. We do this by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical vase:
\[ \text{Number of vases} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical vases needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and we need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression \((\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2\):
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

3. Divide the speed in feet per minute by 60 to find the speed in feet per second.

The calculation is as follows:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of Republicans or only of Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Republicans. This is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Democrats. This is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by their average is 24. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:

BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BC = 2BM = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2} = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121}\). Substituting \(BC\) into the equation, we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{(2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121})^2}{4} + 1 + 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \cos 3\theta = AB^2 - 121 + 1 + 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \cos 3\theta = AB^2 - 120 + 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \cos 3\theta
\]
From the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we have:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
AB^2 - 120 + 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \cos 3\theta = \left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2
\]
By solving this equation, we find that \(\cos 3\theta = \frac{1}{2}\), which implies \(3\theta = 60^\circ\) or \(\theta = 20^\circ\). Therefore, \(\angle BAC = 20^\circ\).

Now, we need to find the length of \(AB\). Using the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABC\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \angle BAC = 2AB^2 - 2AB^2 \cos 20^\circ = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos 20^\circ)
\]
Since \(BC = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
(2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121})^2 = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos 20^\circ) \implies 4(AB^2 - 121) = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos 20^\circ) \implies 2AB^2 - 484 = AB^2 (1 - \cos 20^\circ)
\]
Solving for \(AB^2\), we get:
\[
AB^2 (1 - \cos 20^\circ) - 2AB^2 = -484 \implies AB^2 (-\cos 20^\circ - 1) = -484 \implies AB^2 (\cos 20^\circ + 1) = 484 \implies AB^2 = \frac{484}{\cos 20^\circ + 1}
\]
Using the double angle identity for cosine, \(\cos 20^\circ = 2 \cos^2 10^\circ - 1\), we get:
\[
AB^2 = \frac{484}{2 \cos^2 10^\circ} = \frac{242}{\cos^2 10^\circ}
\]
Since \(\cos 10^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{4}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
AB^2 = \frac{242}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{5}+1}{4}\right)^2} = \frac{242}{\frac{6+2\sqrt{5}}{16}} = \frac{242 \cdot 16}{6+2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3872}{6+2\sqrt{5}} = \frac{3872}{2(3+\sqrt{5})} = \frac{1936}{3+\sqrt{5}}
\]
Rationalizing the denominator, we get:
\[
AB^2 = \frac{1936(3-\sqrt{5})}{(3+\sqrt{5})(3-\sqrt{5})} = \frac{1936(3-\sqrt{5})}{9-5} = \frac{1936(3-\sqrt{5})}{4} = 484(3-\sqrt{5})
\]
Therefore, \(AB = \sqrt{484(3-\sqrt{5})} = 22\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}}\). The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2AB + BC = 2 \cdot 22\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + 2 \sqrt{(22\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}})^2 - 121} = 44\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + 2 \sqrt{484(3-\sqrt{5}) - 121} = 44\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + 2 \sqrt{484(3-\sqrt{5}) - 121} = 44\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + 2 \sqrt{484 \cdot 2(2-\sqrt{5})} = 44\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + 2 \cdot 22\sqrt{2(2-\sqrt{5})} = 44\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + 44\sqrt{4-2\sqrt{5}} = 44(\sqrt{3-\sqrt{5}} + \sqrt{4-2\sqrt{5}}) = 44 \cdot 2 = 88

Therefore, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\boxed{88}\).","[88, '88']",11 \sqrt{5} + 11,"[11, '11']",False
"To find the value of the middle term in a sequence of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the properties of the sequence:**
   - The sequence consists of 27 consecutive positive integers.
   - The sum of these integers is given as \(3^7\).

2. **Determine the middle term:**
   - Since there are 27 integers, which is an odd number, the middle term is the 14th term in the sequence.

3. **Express the sum of the sequence:**
   - Let the first term of the sequence be \(a\).
   - The sequence can be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

4. **Sum of an arithmetic sequence:**
   - The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
     \]
   - Here, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\).

5. **Set up the equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the sum formula:
     \[
     3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26))
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26)
     \]
   - Factor out the common factor of 2:
     \[
     3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times 2(a + 13)
     \]
   - Simplify the fraction and the multiplication:
     \[
     3^7 = 27 \times (a + 13)
     \]

6. **Solve for \(a\):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 27:
     \[
     3^6 = a + 13
     \]
   - Calculate \(3^6\):
     \[
     729 = a + 13
     \]
   - Subtract 13 from both sides:
     \[
     a = 716
     \]

7. **Find the middle term:**
   - The middle term is the 14th term, which is \(a + 13\):
     \[
     a + 13 = 716 + 13 = 729

Therefore, the value of the middle term is \(\boxed{729}\).","[729, '729']",81,"[81, '81']",False
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -7 \]
\[ y - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

Next, we determine the intervals where \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) by testing values in the intervals determined by the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 0] \) and \( [0, 3) \).

- For \(y \in (-\infty, 0]\), choose \(y = 0\):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \(y \in [0, 3)\), choose \(y = 1\):
  \[ 1^2 + 4(1) - 21 = 1 + 4 - 21 = -16 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  This interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\). Therefore, we convert back to \(x\):

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Combining the solutions from both steps, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of dones for each course:

1. **9th course:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.394 = 1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.03
   \]
   The number of homes that use the bus is \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\). The difference is \(159.03 - 123.3 = 35.73\).

2. **10th course:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.331 = 1.35 \times 109.3 = 147.045
   \]
   The number of homes that use the bus is \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\). The difference is \(147.045 - 103.2 = 43.845\).

3. **11th course:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.138 = 1.35 \times 41.4 = 56.07
   \]
   The number of homes that use the bus is \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\). The difference is \(61.8 - 56.07 = 5.73\).

4. **12th course:**
   \[
   135\% \text{ of } 300 \times 0.086 = 1.35 \times 25.8 = 35.01
   \]
   The number of homes that use the bus is \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\). The difference is \(35.01 - 34.8 = 0.21\).

From the calculations, we can see that the smallest difference is for the 12th course, which is \(0.21\). Therefore, the number of homes that use the bus is most proper to \(135\%\) of the number of dones that use the bus for the 12th course.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:

Let's denote:
- \( l \) as the length of the rectangle.
- \( w \) as the width of the rectangle.
- The radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{w}{2} = \frac{\pi w}{2} \). Therefore, the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w \).

The total length of the track is given by:
\[ l + l + \pi w = 2l + \pi w = 400 \]

We can solve this equation for \( l \):
\[ 2l = 400 - \pi w \]
\[ l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2} \]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular camp is given by:
\[ A = l \times w \]

Substituting the expression for \( l \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w \]
\[ A = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2} \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0 \]
\[ \pi w = 200 \]

Now, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \):

For \(\angle R\):
\[

(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):

Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) and the distances from \( P \) to these vertices as \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), \( PE = 11 \), and \( PF = x \).

First, we use the fact that the octahedron is regular, meaning all its edges are of equal length. Let the edge length of the octahedron be \( a \).

### Step 1: Calculate the squared distances between the vertices
We need to find the squared distances between each pair of vertices. For a regular octahedron, the squared distances between the vertices can be either \( a^2 \) (for adjacent vertices) or \( 2a^2 \) (for vertices that are not adjacent).

### Step 2: Set up equations using the given distances
We will use the given distances to set up equations involving \( a^2 \). Consider the distances from \( P \) to each vertex and the distances between the vertices.

#### Equation for \( PA^2 \):
\[ PA^2 = 3^2 = 9 \]

#### Equation for \( PB^2 \):
\[ PB^2 = 7^2 = 49 \]

#### Equation for \( PC^2 \):
\[ PC^2 = 8^2 = 64 \]

#### Equation for \( PD^2 \):
\[ PD^2 = 9^2 = 81 \]

#### Equation for \( PE^2 \):
\[ PE^2 = 11^2 = 121 \]

#### Equation for \( PF^2 \):
\[ PF^2 = x^2 \]

### Step 3: Use the properties of the octahedron
In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This property is known as the ""sum of squared distances"" theorem.

Let \( S \) be the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all six vertices:
\[ S = PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ S = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the sum of the squares of the distances for a regular octahedron
For a regular octahedron with edge length \( a \), the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is given by:
\[ S = 4a^2 + 4a^2 = 8a^2 \]

### Step 5: Equate the two expressions for \( S \)
\[ 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 8a^2 \]

### Step 6: Simplify the left-hand side
\[ 425 + x^2 = 8a^2 \]

### Step 7: Use the fact that the octahedron is regular and edge length \( a \)
Since the octahedron is regular, we need to find \( a \) such that the distances given are consistent with the edge length. However, we can use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant.

### Step 8: Solve for \( x \)
Given the symmetry and properties of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the distances are symmetric and consistent with the edge length. By symmetry and properties of the octahedron, we find that the distances are consistent with the edge length.

Thus, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball piñon to the acceleration of Jack's baseball piñon, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen and Jack are applying the same force to their respective piñons, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

We are given the masses of the piñons: \( m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \) g and \( m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \) g. We need to find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's piñon to the acceleration of Jack's piñon, which is \( \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} \). Rearranging the equation above to solve for this ratio, we get:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{m_{\text{Jack}}}{m_{\text{Jen}}} \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we have:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball piñon to the acceleration of Jack's baseball piñon is:

"To determine the common digit between the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:
\[

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8

**Step 3: Identify the common digit between \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

We compare the digits of \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\):
- \(1556_7\) has the digits: 1, 5, 5, 6
- \(1165_8\) has the digits: 1, 1, 6, 5

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. The smallest common digit is 1.

Thus, the smallest common digit between the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",3,"[3, '3']",False
"To determine the number of handshakes that occur in the group of bruixes, we need to consider the following:

1. Each bruixes wants to give a hand shake to every other bruixes.
2. There are no hand shakes between bruixes who are friends.
3. There are no hand shakes between bruixes who detest each other.

Given that all bruixes are friends with each other and detest each other, each bruixes will give a hand shake to every other bruixes. This is a classic problem of finding the number of ways to choose 2 people out of \( n \) people to shake hands, which is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \).

The combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} \) is calculated as follows:
\[

\]

In this problem, the number of bruixes is 6. So, we substitute \( n = 6 \) into the formula:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Thus, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:

2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:

\[a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0\]

We also know from the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time:

\[(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
(-2)^2 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 + 2 \cdot 0
\]

\[
4 = \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2
\]

We can express \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2\) in terms of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 4 - 2 \cdot 0 = 4
\]

We also know that:

\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = 4 - 2(a + b + c) = 4
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 0\), we have:

\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = 4
\]

We also know that:

\[
\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2) = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 8
\]

Since \(\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = 4\), we have:

\[
4 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 8
\]

\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 4 - 8 = -4
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 0\), \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0\), which simplifies to \(t^3 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = 0\). We need to find \(ab + bc + ca\). Using the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken three at a time, we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0
\]

We also know that:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2
\]

\[
= (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = 0^2 - 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2) = 8
\]

Since \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -4\), we have:

\[
ab + bc + ca = -2
\]

Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is \(t^3 - (-2)t - (-2) = t^3 + 2t + 2\). The roots of this polynomial are \(-1\), \(-1\), and \(2\). Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{-2\}\).

"Let's define the cost of one llapis as \( x \) dollars and the cost of one goma desborr gran as \( y \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. Three llapis and one goma desborr gran cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3x + y = 1.24
   \]

2. Five llapis and one goma desborr gran cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5x + y = 1.82
   \]

To find the cost of one llapis, we can eliminate \( y \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
5x + y - 3x - y = 2x
\]
And simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58
\]
So, we have:
\[
2x = 0.58
\]
To solve for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]
Since the cost is asked in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:
\[

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into its decimal form.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\). To do this, we can use long division.

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[
   137 \div 500
   \]

2. **Since 137 is less than 500, we add a decimal point and a zero to make it 1370:**
   \[

3. **Divide 1370 by 500:**
   \[
   500 \text{ goes into } 1370 \text{ two times (since } 500 \times 2 = 1000\text{)}

   Write down 2 and subtract 1000 from 1370:
   \[
   1370 - 1000 = 370

4. **Add another zero to make it 3700:**
   \[

5. **Divide 3700 by 500:**
   \[
   500 \text{ goes into } 3700 \text{ seven times (since } 500 \times 7 = 3500\text{)}

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Without loss of generality, we can set \(a = kb\) where \(k\) is a positive constant.

The vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
- \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
- \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)
- \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance from any point \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
\frac{a}{4}x - \frac{b}{4}y < -\frac{a^2}{16} - \frac{b^2}{16}
\]

Multiplying through by 16:
\[
4ax - 4by < -a^2 - b^2
\]

Rearranging to standard form:
\[
4ax - 4by + a^2 + b^2 < 0
\]

Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
1. For vertex \(B\):
\[
4ax + 4by + a^2 + b^2 < 0
\]
2. For vertex \(C\):
\[
-4ax + 4by + a^2 + b^2 < 0
\]
3. For vertex \(D\):
\[
-4ax - 4by + a^2 + b^2 < 0
\]

These inequalities define four regions inside the rectangle. The region where \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the intersection of these four regions. This intersection forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a}{2}\) and \(\frac{b}{2}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{a}{2} \times \frac{b}{2} = \frac{ab}{4}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = a \times b
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{4}}{ab} = \frac{1}{4}

"To determine the residue of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6.

\[a = bq + r\]

where \(0 \leq r < b\).

In this problem, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We perform the division:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

The quotient \(q\) is 9. To find the remainder \(r\), we multiply the quotient by the divisor and subtract the result from the original number:

\[54 - (6 \times 9) = 54 - 54 = 0\]

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. **Add the amounts step by step:**
   - First, add Linda and Sherry's amounts:
     \[
     27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
     \]
   - Next, add June's amount to the result:

"To find the average (arithmetic mean) of the class, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[

\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

We see that the sums of the first and third rows are both \( 2n + 1 \). For the magic square to be valid, the sum of the second row must also be \( 2n + 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:

\[
n - 6 = 1

Then, we add 6 to both sides:

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

The other diagonal is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

"To determine how many feet less that Martha camina compared to Jim, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim camina along the diagonal of the rectangular camp. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]

where \( l \) is the length of the camp and \( w \) is the width of the camp. For this problem, the length \( l \) is 400 feet and the width \( w \) is 300 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \]

So, Jim travels 500 feet.

So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many feet less that Martha camina compared to Jim. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim travels from the distance Martha travels:

The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[

\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.

Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.

So the expression simplifies to:
