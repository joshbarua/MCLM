"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the value of \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians, we can follow these steps:

1. **Express \( z \) and \( c \) in complex form:**
   \[
   z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i
   \]
   \[
   c = 2 - 3i
   \]

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   Subtract \( c \) from \( z \):
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   z - c = 2 + \sqrt{2} - 2 - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i + 3i
   \]
   \[
   z - c = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) (which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \)) gives:
   \[
   (z - c) \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Use the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplify each term:
   \[
   = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} - 3i^2\frac{2}{2}
   \]
   \[
   = 1 + i - 3i + 3
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate \( w \) back to the original position:**
   Add \( c \) to the result:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i)
   \]
   Simplify the expression:
   \[
   w = 4 + 2 - 2i - 3i
   \]
   \[
   w = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the value of \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people are in the group given the conditions. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of people and the conditions:**
   - There are 8 people in total.
   - There are 3 people who are guesting (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas).
   - The remaining people are either friends or family members of the guesting people.
   - Each guesting person has at least one friend or family member among the remaining people.
   - The number of friends or family members of each guesting person is the same.

2. **Calculate the number of non-guesting people:**
   - Since there are 8 people in total and 3 are guesting, the number of non-guesting people is \(8 - 3 = 5\).

3. **Determine the number of friends or family members each guesting person has:**
   - Since each guesting person has at least one friend or family member among the remaining people and the number of friends or family members of each guesting person is the same, we need to find a number that divides 5 (the number of non-guesting people) and is at least 1.
   - The only possible number that satisfies this condition is 1 (since 5 divided by 3 or 2 would not result in an integer).

4. **Verify the solution:**
   - If each guesting person has 1 friend or family member, then the total number of friends or family members is \(3 \times 1 = 3\).
   - However, this would mean there are only 3 non-guesting people, which contradicts our earlier calculation that there are 5 non-guesting people.
   - Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) modulo 7.

First, we calculate each term modulo 7:
\[
n + 2 \equiv 2 + 2 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}

\[
n + 4 \equiv 2 + 4 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}

Now, we compute the product modulo 7:

\[

"To determine the angle of rotation that will return a regular pentagon to its original position, we need to understand the symmetry of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means there are 5 different positions where the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry position is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate the angle of rotation as follows:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \) instead.

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AB \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( CD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7

First, recall the definition of the tangent function:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]
We are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). Substituting this into the tangent function, we get:

"To determine the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will make the function undefined. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2) \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us:

\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]

This equation has solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to determine the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, specifically \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). However, we need to adjust the middle term to match the form. Instead, let's consider the expression in a different way by recognizing a pattern in the coefficients.

Notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

This is a known algebraic identity for the sum of a geometric series. The expression \(100^3 - 1\) can be factored as:
\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1).\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{(100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99} = \frac{99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99} = 100^2 + 100 + 1.\]

Now, we can simply calculate \(100^2 + 100 + 1\):
\[100^2 = 10000,\]
\[10000 + 100 = 10100,\]
\[10100 + 1 = 10101.\]

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{10101}\).","[10101, '10101']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False
"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of the ratio \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express \(\|\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v}\|\) in terms of the components of \(\bold{v}\). If \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), then

\[
A\mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \( A\mathbf{v} \) is

\[
\|A\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

The magnitude of \(\mathbf{v}\) is

\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of the ratio

\[
\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}.
\]

Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then \( x = ty \), and the ratio becomes

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4(ty)^2 + 12(ty)y + 13y^2}{(ty)^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2y^2 + 12ty^2 + 13y^2}{t^2y^2 + y^2}} = \sqrt{\frac{y^2(4t^2 + 12t + 13)}{y^2(t^2 + 1)}} = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \).

Taking the derivative of \( g(t) \) with respect to \( t \), we get

\[
g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-6(2t^2 + 3t - 2)}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]

Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we solve the quadratic equation \( 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0 \). Using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \), we get

\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \).

We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these critical points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):

\[
g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{4 \cdot \frac{1}{4} + 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,
\]

\[
g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{4 \cdot 4 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,
\]

\[
\lim_{t \to \pm \infty} g(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4.
\]

The maximum value of \( g(t) \) is 16. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(t) = \sqrt{g(t)} \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \).

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by examining the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

\[1^{(2^{235423523})} = 1.\]

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**

   For \(58_9\):
   \[
   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   For \(18_9\):

3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of bigats each type of tree has based on the given relationships. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( T \) is the number of bigats on a tree.
- \( S \) is the number of bigats on a squig.
- \( G \) is the number of bigats on a goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Ang Sampung treeks ay kasing bigat ng tatlong squigs at isang goolee. This translates to:
   \[
   T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Ang dalawang treeks at isang goolee ay katumbas ng bigatong isang squig. This translates to:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]
3. Ang pinagsamang bigatong ilang treeks ay katumbas ng bigatong isang squig. This translates to:
   \[
   T = S
   \]

We now have a system of three equations:
1. \( T = 3S + G \)
2. \( 2T + G = S \)
3. \( T = S \)

We can substitute \( T = S \) into the first and second equations. Substituting \( T = S \) into the first equation gives:
\[
S = 3S + G
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
G = S - 3S = -2S
\]

Substituting \( T = S \) into the second equation gives:
\[
2S + G = S
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
G = S - 2S = -S
\]

We now have two expressions for \( G \):
\[
G = -2S \quad \text{and} \quad G = -S
\]

Since both expressions must be equal, we set them equal to each other:
\[
-2S = -S
\]
Adding \( 2S \) to both sides, we get:
\[
0 = S

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The expansion of \((3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)\) is given by:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]
Expanding each term, we get:
\[
3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Adding these together, we obtain:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a = 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]
We know this must be equal to \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]
Solving the last equation for \(a\), we get:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation to solve for \(b\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]
Finally, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
The equation is satisfied, so our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the given information about the volume and the rate at which the volume is changing. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the volume is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, so we can write:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We are also given that the height of the cylinder is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so we can write:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the radius, we use the chain rule to relate the rates of change of the volume and the height:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since \( V = \pi r^2 h \), we can differentiate both sides with respect to \( h \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( 4\pi \):

\[ 5 = r^2 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:

\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the smallest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to ensure that the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) are equal to the value of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined as:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

First, we find the right-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = a(a)^2 = a^3. \]

Next, we find the left-hand limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = a(a) + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), the right-hand limit must equal the left-hand limit, and both must equal the value of the function at \(x = a\). Since \(f(a) = a(a)^2 = a^3\), we set the left-hand limit equal to the right-hand limit:
\[ a^3 = a^2 + 2a. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression \(a^2 - a - 2\):
\[ a^2 - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1). \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]

Setting each factor equal to zero, we find the solutions:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

Since \(a\) is a number, we need to check which of these values makes the function continuous at \(x = a\) and ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) is not a straight line. If \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\
0 & \text{if } x < 0,
\end{cases}
\]
which is a straight line. Therefore, \(a = 0\) is not a valid solution.

If \(a = 2\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
4x^2 & \text{if } x \geq 2,\\
2x + 4 & \text{if } x < 2.
\end{cases}
\]
This is a piecewise function that is continuous at \(x = 2\) and does not form a straight line.

If \(a = -1\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
-x^2 & \text{if } x \geq -1,\\
-x - 2 & \text{if } x < -1.
\end{cases}
\]
This is a piecewise function that is continuous at \(x = -1\) and does not form a straight line.

Since we are asked to find the smallest possible value of \(a\), we compare the values \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\). The smallest value is \(a = -1\).

Therefore, the smallest possible value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",2,"[2, '2']",False
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with radius 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\) and solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1.
\]
This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[
0 \le \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda - 1 \ge 0 \implies \lambda \ge 1,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \le 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \le \lambda \implies -1 \le 0,
\]
which is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda \ge 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2. We start by finding \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) is a solution. For \(x \neq 0\), we have:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^4 x^3 - \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda^2\), we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (\lambda^2 x^3 - \lambda^2 x^2 - x + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we substitute \(x\) into the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(\lambda^2 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 - \lambda^2 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(\lambda^2 \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} - \lambda^2 \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(\frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda} - (\lambda - 1)^2 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda\right) + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
This further simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(\frac{\lambda^3 - 3\lambda^2 + 3\lambda - 1}{\lambda} - \lambda^2 + 2\lambda - 1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 3 - \frac{1}{\lambda} - \lambda^2 + 2\lambda - 1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda\right) + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(-\lambda + 2 - \frac{1}{\lambda} - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(2 - \frac{1}{\lambda} - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(2 - \frac{1 + \lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(2 - 1\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 + \lambda^2 - 1 = 2\lambda^2 - 1.
\]
For this to be zero, we need:
\[
2\lambda^2 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies \lambda = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the tangent addition formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\). Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent of a specific angle. By inspection or using known trigonometric values, we find that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan \theta = \tan 85^\circ.
\]

Since the tangent function is periodic with period \(180^\circ\), the general solution for \(\theta\) is:

\[
\theta = 85^\circ + 180^\circ k,
\]

where \(k\) is any integer. The smallest positive angle is when \(k = 0\):

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider the fact that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" and ""P"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \) (for each of the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" and ""P"")

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1.

1. Calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

2. Calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5^2} \right\rfloor\):

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0
\]

Since \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5^3} \right\rfloor = 0\), all higher terms in the series will also be 0. Therefore, we sum the factors we have found:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( f(x, x) \) at these critical points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points within the interior of the region \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\) that could give a value greater than 1. However, since the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric and the maximum value on the boundary and on the line \( x = y \) is 1, it is reasonable to conclude that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices at \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \(z = e^{i\theta}\). Then, \(\frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta}\), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, \(z\) can be either \(e^{i\pi/5}\) or \(e^{-i\pi/5}\).

We need to find \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\). If \(z = e^{i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \(z = e^{-i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \(z^{85} = -1\), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \(G\) of a triangle and the relationship between the areas of similar triangles.

1. **Centroid Properties**: The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

2. **Parallel Line Property**: The line through the centroid \(G\) that is parallel to \(BC\) will intersect \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

3. **Ratio of Similar Triangles**: The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the corresponding segments of the medians. Since \(G\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the segment \(AG\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the median \(AD\). Therefore, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). This means that the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

4. **Area Ratio**: The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the ratio of the area of triangle \(AMN\) to the area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

5. **Area Calculation**: Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

6. **Area of Quadrilateral \(Bing\)**: The area of quadrilateral \(Bing\) is the area of triangle \(ABC\) minus the area of triangle \(AMN\):
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle Bing = 144 - 64 = 80
   \]

7. **Area of Triangle \(Bing\)**: Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and \(G\) is the centroid, triangle \(Bing\) is divided into two smaller triangles, \(Bing\) and \(Cing\), which are congruent. Therefore, the area of triangle \(Bing\) is half of the area of quadrilateral \(Bing\):
   \[
   \text{Area of } \triangle Bing = \frac{80}{2} = 40

\[ 3 + 24 + 10 + 6 = 43 \]

Next, we find the total number of books in Palapag 2:
\[ 0 + 8 + 10 + 6 = 24 \]

Then, we find the total number of books in Palapag 3:

We are given that the 6th term (\(a_6\)) is 200 and the 11th term (\(a_{11}\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write two equations:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d = 200\]
\[a_{11} = a_1 + 10d = 500\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second to eliminate \(a_1\):

\[(a_1 + 10d) - (a_1 + 5d) = 500 - 200\]
\[5d = 300\]
\[d = 60\]

\[a_1 = 200 - 300\]
\[a_1 = -100\]

1. **Simplify the denominator**: The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). We can rewrite this as \(4 \cdot 78125\), but it is more useful to keep it in its prime factorized form for now.

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10. The prime factorization of 10 is \(2 \cdot 5\).

- The prime factorization of 100 is \(100 = 2^2 \times 5^2\).
- The prime factorization of 150 is \(150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2\).

The GCD is found by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that appears in both factorizations:

Combine like terms:
\[ 100 - 5n = 75 \]

Subtract 100 from both sides:
\[ -5n = 75 - 100 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 prime numbers out of 6. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even. This can happen in two ways:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even number (2), the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers is:

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

The probability that the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

The rectangle has a width of 3 units and a height of 4 units. The diagonals intersect at the point where they divide the rectangle into four smaller regions. The two shaded triangles are right triangles.

Let's label the vertices of the rectangle as follows:
- \( A = (0, 4) \)
- \( B = (3, 4) \)
- \( C = (3, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, 0) \)

The diagonals are \( AC \) and \( AD \). The intersection point of the diagonals is the midpoint of both diagonals, which we can find by averaging the coordinates of the endpoints.

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1, we need to consider the properties of the number 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the last two digits of the number must be 00.

Next, we need to ensure that the number has at least one factor of 2. Since the last two digits are 00, the number already satisfies this condition.

Now, we need to ensure that the number has at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the number must have at least two 1's to satisfy this condition.

Therefore, the smallest number that meets all these conditions is 1100. Let's verify:

- The number 1100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2\).
- The number 1100 has one factor of 2.
- The sum of the digits of 1100 is \(1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3. This means we need to add more 1's to make the sum divisible by 3.

The next smallest number we can try is 11100. Let's verify:

- The number 11100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2\).
- The number 11100 has one factor of 2.
- The sum of the digits of 11100 is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.

Since 11100 meets all the conditions, the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1 is:

"To determine the probability that a checker is placed on an isolate square of a checkerboard, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of squares on the checkerboard:**
   A standard checkerboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so the total number of squares is:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64
   \]

2. **Determine the number of isolate squares:**
   An isolate square is a square that is not adjacent to any other square. This means that the checker cannot be placed on the edge or corner of the checkerboard. The isolate squares are the ones in the middle 6 rows and middle 6 columns, forming a smaller 6x6 grid. Therefore, the number of isolate squares is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   The probability that a checker is placed on an isolate square is the number of isolate squares divided by the total number of squares. Thus, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{64} = \frac{9}{16}

Therefore, the probability that the checker is placed on an isolate square of the checkerboard is:

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Thus, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This gives us \(0.00021605\).

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.

We know that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = 1 - \cos^2 20^\circ\), but a simpler approach is to use the known value of the product \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, we have:

- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that every point on the surface has the same \(z\)-coordinate. In other words, the surface is a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( r - 5 \) is a root of \( g(x) \). This is because:

\[ g(x) = f(x + 5) = 0 \implies f(x + 5) = 0 \implies x + 5 = r \implies x = r - 5. \]

Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15. \]

Next, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Substituting this back into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

\[

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.

Rearranging this equation, we get:

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3\):

"To determine the number of sides of the convex polygon, we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
\]

According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \). Let the measure of the missing angle be \( x \). Therefore, the sum of all the interior angles of the polygon is:

\[
1070^\circ + x
\]

Since the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \( n \) sides is \( 180(n-2) \), we can set up the following equation:

\[
1070^\circ + x = 180(n-2)
\]

The measure of any interior angle of a convex polygon is less than \( 180^\circ \), so \( x \) must be less than \( 180^\circ \). This gives us the inequality:

\[
1070^\circ < 180(n-2) < 1250^\circ
\]

We first solve the left part of the inequality:

\[
1070^\circ < 180(n-2)
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 180^\circ \):

\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
5.9444 < n-2
\]

Adding 2 to both sides:

\[
7.9444 < n
\]

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \geq 8
\]

Next, we solve the right part of the inequality:

\[
180(n-2) < 1250^\circ
\]

Dividing both sides by \( 180^\circ \):

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
n-2 < 6.9444
\]

Adding 2 to both sides:

\[
n < 8.9444

Since \( n \) must be an integer, we have:

n \leq 8

n = 8

If the sum of all the interior angles except one is \( 1070^\circ \), then the missing angle is:

\[
1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ

"To solve for the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the definition of the inverse. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, \( x = t+2 \), so we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (23-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[

11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.

From the above, we see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( t \) must be an odd integer between 0 and 23, we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \). To verify, we check if \( 17+2 = 19 \) is the inverse of 17 modulo 23:

\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]

We need to check if \( 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \):

\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]

So, \( 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \), confirming that 19 is indeed the inverse of 17 modulo 23. Therefore, the solution is:

\[ A = 6s^2 \]
Substituting the side length \( s = 1 \) foot into the formula, we get:
\[ A = 6 \times (1)^2 = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Since the problem asks for the surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, the surface area in square inches is:
\[ A = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

The surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{864}\) square inches.","[864, '864']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply these two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2\mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula for the distance between a point on one line and the plane containing the other line. Specifically, if \(\mathbf{a}\) is a point on the first line and \(\mathbf{b}\) is a point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{n}\) is a normal vector to the plane containing the second line, the distance \(D\) is given by

\[
D = \frac{|\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})|}{\|\mathbf{n}\|}.
\]

However, since the direction vector of the second line is a scalar multiple of the direction vector of the first line, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines in terms of the direction vectors and the vector connecting a point on each line:

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|}.
\]

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\):

\[
\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\):

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(D\):

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a width of \(10\) units (from \(-5\) to \(5\)) and a height of \(8\) units (from \(-4\) to \(4\)). Therefore, the inequalities that define the interior of the rectangle are:
\[

\[

We need to count all integer pairs \((x, y)\) that satisfy these inequalities.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

and

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},

"To determine the total presio of the selyos noong 1970s, we need to consider the number of selyos from each country and their respective presios per selyo. The presios are as follows: Brazil ($6$ sentimos), France ($4$ sentimos), Peru ($4$ sentios), and Spain ($5$ sentios).

From the table, we can see the number of selyos from each country in the 1970s:
- Brazil: $12$
- France: $12$
- Peru: $6$
- Spain: $13$

Now, we calculate the total presio for each country:
- For Brazil: $12 \text{ selyos} \times 6 \text{ sentimos/selyo} = 72 \text{ sentimos}$
- For France: $12 \text{ selyos} \times 4 \text{ sentimos/selyo} = 48 \text{ sentimos}$

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(\overline{CD}\)) as \(h\). The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times h
\]

To find \(AC\), we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This means that \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle, and we can use the angle bisector theorem in \(\triangle ABD\). The angle bisector theorem states that:
\[
\frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{BD}{AD}
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \times [ABCD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \times 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a+b} \times [ABCD] = \frac{b}{a+b} \times 42
\]

The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are equal:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = [\triangle ABC] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

This simplifies to:

\[

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

This simplifies to:

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. For two line segments to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points is on one side of the circle and the other pair is on the other side.

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the points are on a circle, we need to account for the rotational symmetry. The number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is \(\frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6\).

"To determine how many times the volume of the spherical tangke can fit into the cylindrical beaker, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tangke and then find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tangke. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tangke, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the spherical tangke can fit into the cylindrical beaker. This is done by dividing the volume of the cylindrical beaker by the volume of the spherical tangke:
\[
\text{Number of times} = \frac{V_{\text{cylinder}}}{V_{\text{sphere}}} = \frac{72\pi}{288\pi} = \frac{72}{288} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Therefore, the volume of the spherical tangke can fit into the cylindrical beaker \(\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}\) times.","[1/4, '\\frac{1}{4}']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100:
\[
\frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{100}
\]
\[
\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}
\]

"To determine the number of bisiklets Angang bisiklete makes in a second, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the rate from bisiklets per minute to bisiklets per second:**
   - Angang bisiklete makes 20 bisiklets in 1 minute.
   - There are 60 seconds in 1 minute.
   - To find the rate in bisiklets per second, we divide the number of bisiklets per minute by the number of seconds per minute:

2. **Convert the rate from bisiklets per second to bisiklets per pulgada:**
   - The problem does not specify the relationship between bisiklets and pulgada. However, if we assume that the question is asking for the rate in bisiklets per second directly (since no other conversion is provided), we can conclude that the rate in bisiklets per second is already the answer.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from Ang isang komite n Senado such that no member of the subcommittee is from the same party, we need to consider the composition of the original committee and the constraints given.

The original committee consists of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats. Since no member of the subcommittee can be from the same party, the subcommittee must have members from both parties. The possible distributions of members in the subcommittee are:

1. 1 Republican and 4 Democrats
2. 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats
3. 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats
4. 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat

We will calculate the number of ways to form the subcommittee for each distribution and then sum these values.

**Case 1: 1 Republican and 4 Democrats**
- The number of ways to choose 1 Republican from 8 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{8}{1} = 8 \).
- The number of ways to choose 4 Democrats from 6 is \( \binom{6}{4} = 15 \).
- Therefore, the number of ways to form this subcommittee is \( 8 \times 15 = 120 \).

**Case 2: 2 Republicans and 3 Democrats**
- The number of ways to choose 2 Republicans from 8 is \( \binom{8}{2} = 28 \).
- The number of ways to choose 3 Democrats from 6 is \( \binom{6}{3} = 20 \).
- Therefore, the number of ways to form this subcommittee is \( 28 \times 20 = 560 \).

**Case 3: 3 Republicans and 2 Democrats**
- The number of ways to choose 3 Republicans from 8 is \( \binom{8}{3} = 56 \).
- The number of ways to choose 2 Democrats from 6 is \( \binom{6}{2} = 15 \).
- Therefore, the number of ways to form this subcommittee is \( 56 \times 15 = 840 \).

**Case 4: 4 Republicans and 1 Democrat**
- The number of ways to choose 4 Republicans from 8 is \( \binom{8}{4} = 70 \).
- The number of ways to choose 1 Democrat from 6 is \( \binom{6}{1} = 6 \).
- Therefore, the number of ways to form this subcommittee is \( 70 \times 6 = 420 \).

Adding the number of ways from all cases, we get:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

"Given that the product of three consecutive integers is 120 and their mean is 24, we need to find the three integers. Let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we calculate the mean of these three integers:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]
We are given that the mean is 24, so:
\[
n = 24
\]
This means the three consecutive integers are \( 23 \), \( 24 \), and \( 25 \). We can verify that their product is indeed 120:
\[
23 \times 24 \times 25 = 120
\]
However, this calculation is incorrect because the product should be 120. Let's recheck the problem statement and correct the mean calculation.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result. Therefore, we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we can rewrite the equation as:

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. To do this, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

This product includes \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\). We know that \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)\). Therefore, we can write:

\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right).
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{8} \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\]

Therefore, the value is:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ACB} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ABC} = \frac{AB}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{AB}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
BC = AB \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = AB \cdot \frac{2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = 2AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
In \(\triangle BDM\), \(BD\) can also be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \left(AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2}\right)^2 + 1 = A^2 B^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 1
\]
Substituting \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = A^2 B^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 1
\]
Since \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), we have \(AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + A^2 B^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\). Therefore, \(A^2 B^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = AB^2 - 121\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = AB^2 - 121 + 1 = AB^2 - 120
\]
By trial and error or solving the equation, we find that \(\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, \(\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4}\). Substituting \(\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3}{4}\) into the equation for \(BD\), we get:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{4 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2 + 6 \left(\frac{3}{4}\right) - 4} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot \frac{9}{16} + 6 \cdot \frac{3}{4} - 4} = \frac{1}{\frac{9}{4} + \frac{18}{4} - 4} = \frac{1}{\frac{27}{4} - \frac{16}{4}} = \frac{1}{\frac{11}{4}} = \frac{4}{11}
\]
Since \(BC = 2AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = 2AB \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{2} AB\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{\sqrt{7}}{2} AB\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{7}{4} AB^2
\]
Solving for \(AB^2\), we get:
\[
AB^2 - \frac{7}{4} AB^2 = 121 \implies \frac{1}{4} AB^2 = 121 \implies AB^2 = 484 \implies AB = 22
\]
Therefore, \(BC = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{2} \cdot 22 = 11\sqrt{7}\). The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 22 + 22 + 11\sqrt{7} = 44 + 11\sqrt{7}
\]
The final answer is:

"To find the median of the 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate \(3^7\):**
   \[
   3^7 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2187
   \]

2. **Understand the concept of the median:**
   The median of a set of numbers is the middle number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. For a set with an odd number of elements, the median is the element in the \(\left(\frac{n+1}{2}\right)\)-th position, where \(n\) is the number of elements.

3. **Determine the position of the median:**
   Since there are 27 integers, the median will be the \(\left(\frac{27+1}{2}\right)\)-th integer.
   \[
   \frac{27+1}{2} = \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]
   Therefore, the median is the 14th integer in the ordered list.

4. **Assume the integers are equal:**
   To minimize the complexity, let's assume all 27 integers are equal. If each integer is \(x\), then:
   \[
   27x = 2187
   \]
   Solving for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
   \]

5. **Verify the median:**
   If all integers are 81, then the ordered list is:
   \[
   81, 81, 81, \ldots, 81 \quad (\text{27 times})
   \]
   The 14th integer in this list is 81.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). However, since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only need to test the interval \([0, 3)\).

For \(0 \leq y < 3\), we can choose a test point, say \(y = 1\):
\[ (1)^2 + 4(1) - 21 = 1 + 4 - 21 = -16 \]
Since \(-16 < 0\), the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is true for \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Thus, we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Combining the results from both steps, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) as:
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine the ratio of the number of male sumasakay to the number of female sumasakay in the 11th baitang, we start by calculating the number of male and female sumasakay in that baitang.

The total number of students in the 11th baitang is 600 (300 lalaki and 300 babae). According to the table, 13.8% of the students in the 11th baitang are female sumasakay. Therefore, the number of female sumasakay is:
\[
0.138 \times 600 = 82.8
\]
Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 82.8 to the nearest whole number, which is 83. Thus, there are 83 female sumasakay in the 11th baitang.

Next, we calculate the number of male sumasakay in the 11th baitang. Since the total number of students is 600 and 83 of them are female sumasakay, the number of male sumasakay is:
\[
600 - 83 = 517

Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of male sumasakay to the number of female sumasakay. This ratio is:
\[

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[\boxed{(-9, 0) \cup (9, 36)}.\]","[Union(Interval.open(-9, 0), Interval.open(9, 36)), '(-9, 0) \\cup (9, 36)']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"To determine the possible area of the square cutout in the track, we need to analyze the given information and the geometry of the track.

1. **Identify the total perimeter of the track:**
   The total perimeter of the track is given as 400 meters.

2. **Understand the structure of the track:**
   The track consists of two straight segments and two semicircular segments. The straight segments are the lengths of the sides of the square cutout, and the semicircular segments are the curves at the corners of the square.

3. **Calculate the perimeter of the straight segments:**
   Let the side length of the square cutout be \( s \). Since there are four sides, the total length of the straight segments is:
   \[
   4s
   \]

4. **Calculate the perimeter of the semicircular segments:**
   Each semicircle has a radius equal to half the side length of the square, which is \( \frac{s}{2} \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( r \) is \( 2\pi r \), so the circumference of a semicircle is:
   \[
   \pi r = \pi \left( \frac{s}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi s}{2}
   \]
   Since there are two semicircles, the total length of the semicircular segments is:
   \[
   2 \times \frac{\pi s}{2} = \pi s
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for the total perimeter:**
   The total perimeter of the track is the sum of the lengths of the straight segments and the semicircular segments:
   \[
   4s + \pi s = 400
   \]

6. **Solve for \( s \):**
   Factor out \( s \) from the left-hand side:
   \[
   s(4 + \pi) = 400
   \]
   Divide both sides by \( 4 + \pi \):
   \[
   s = \frac{400}{4 + \pi}
   \]

7. **Calculate the area of the square cutout:**
   The area \( A \) of a square with side length \( s \) is:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   Substitute \( s = \frac{400}{4 + \pi} \) into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \left( \frac{400}{4 + \pi} \right)^2
   \]

8. **Simplify the expression:**
   \[
   A = \frac{400^2}{(4 + \pi)^2} = \frac{160000}{(4 + \pi)^2}
   \]

Therefore, the possible area of the square cutout, in square meters, is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the right triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Recall the definition of the sine function for \(\angle T\):
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT}
\]

Substitute the known values:

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that the distance is expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we identify \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]
 So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances to the other five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) and the distances from \( P \) to these vertices as \( PA = 3 \), \( PB = 7 \), \( PC = 8 \), \( PD = 9 \), and \( PE = 11 \). We need to find \( PF \).

A regular octahedron can be thought of as two pyramids with a square base joined at their bases. The vertices \( A, B, C, D \) form a square, and the vertices \( E \) and \( F \) are symmetrically placed above and below the center of the square, respectively.

The key property of a regular octahedron is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This constant is equal to four times the square of the circumradius of the octahedron plus four times the square of the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron.

First, we calculate the circumradius \( R \) of the octahedron. The circumradius of a regular octahedron with edge length \( a \) is given by:
\[
R = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

Next, we use the property of the sum of the squares of the distances. Let \( O \) be the center of the octahedron. The distance from \( P \) to \( O \) is \( d \). Then, the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = 4R^2 + 4d^2
\]

We know the values of \( PA, PB, PC, PD, \) and \( PE \):
\[
PA^2 = 3^2 = 9
\]
\[
PB^2 = 7^2 = 49
\]
\[
PC^2 = 8^2 = 64
\]
\[
PD^2 = 9^2 = 81
\]
\[
PE^2 = 11^2 = 121
\]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + PF^2 = 4R^2 + 4d^2
\]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[
424 + PF^2 = 4R^2 + 4d^2
\]

We need to find \( PF^2 \). To do this, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. Since \( P \) is inside the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances to the vertices is the same for any point inside the octahedron.

Given the symmetry and the distances provided, we can use the property of the sum of the squares of the distances to find \( PF \). We know that the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[
4R^2 + 4d^2 = 424 + PF^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is constant, we can use the given distances to find \( PF \). By symmetry and the properties of the octahedron, we can assume that the distances are symmetrically distributed around the center.

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we can use the property of the sum of the squares of the distances to find \( PF \). By symmetry and the properties of the octahedron, we can assume that the distances are symmetrically distributed around the center.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given information about the masses of the softball and the baseball and the relationship between mass and power. The power is proportional to the mass, so we can express the power of the softball and the baseball in terms of their masses.

Let's denote the power of the softball as \( P_{\text{softball}} \) and the power of the baseball as \( P_{\text{baseball}} \). According to the problem, the power of the softball is proportional to its mass, and the power of the baseball is proportional to its mass. This means we can write:

\[ P_{\text{softball}} = k \cdot m_{\text{softball}} \]
\[ P_{\text{baseball}} = k \cdot m_{\text{baseball}} \]

where \( k \) is the constant of proportionality, \( m_{\text{softball}} \) is the mass of the softball, and \( m_{\text{baseball}} \) is the mass of the baseball. We are given that the mass of the softball is 200 g and the mass of the baseball is 150 g. Therefore, we can substitute these values into the equations:

\[ P_{\text{softball}} = k \cdot 200 \]
\[ P_{\text{baseball}} = k \cdot 150 \]

We need to find the ratio of the power of the softball to the power of the baseball. This ratio is given by:

\[ \frac{P_{\text{softball}}}{P_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{k \cdot 200}{k \cdot 150} \]

The constant of proportionality \( k \) cancels out in the numerator and the denominator:

\[ \frac{P_{\text{softball}}}{P_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{200}{150} \]

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{200 \div 50}{150 \div 50} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the power of the softball to the power of the baseball is:

"To determine the last digit of the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we need to find the remainders when \(629\) is divided by \(7\) and \(8\).

First, let's find the last digit of the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\). This is equivalent to finding the remainder when \(629\) is divided by \(7\):

\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \text{ remainder } 6
\]

So, the last digit of the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(6\).

Next, let's find the last digit of the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\). This is equivalent to finding the remainder when \(629\) is divided by \(8\):

\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \text{ remainder } 5
\]

So, the last digit of the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) is \(5\).

The last digits of the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) are \(6\) and \(5\) respectively. Since these digits are different, they do not form a pair of equal digits as in the example given in the problem statement. However, the problem specifically asks for the last digit of the base 7 representation, which is \(6\).

Thus, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{6}

"To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Identify the number of mangkukulam and salamangkero.
   - There are 5 mangkukulam.
   - There are 3 salamangkero.

2. Determine the condition for making pagipagkamay.
   - A mangkukulam can make pagipagkamay if there is at least one salamangkero available.
   - A salamangkero can make pagipagkamay if there is at least one mangkukulam available.

3. Analyze the situation:
   - Since there are 5 mangkukulam and 3 salamangkero, each mangkukulam can make pagipagkamay because there is at least one salamangkero.
   - Each salamangkero can make pagipagkamay because there is at least one mangkukulam.

4. Calculate the total number of pagipagkamay:
   - Each of the 5 mangkukulam can make pagipagkamay, so that's 5 pagipagkamay.
   - Each of the 3 salamangkero can make pagipagkamay, so that's 3 pagipagkamay.
   - Therefore, the total number of pagipagkamay is \(5 + 3 = 8\).

The answer is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the polynomial \( g(x) \) which is equal to \( f(x-1) \), we need to substitute \( x-1 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Let's do this step by step.

First, substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we need to expand each term. Start with \( (x-1)^4 \):
\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 3(x-1)^4 = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3. \]

Now, expand \( (x-1)^2 \):
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]
So,
\[ 5(x-1)^2 = 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 5x^2 - 10x + 5. \]

Next, expand \( -9(x-1) \):
\[ -9(x-1) = -9x + 9. \]

Now, combine all these expanded terms:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combine like terms:
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \) are 3, -12, 23, -31, and 15. To find the sum of these coefficients, we add them together:
\[ 3 + (-12) + 23 + (-31) + 15 = 3 - 12 + 23 - 31 + 15. \]

Perform the addition step by step:
\[ 3 - 12 = -9, \]
\[ -9 + 23 = 14, \]
\[ 14 - 31 = -17, \]
\[ -17 + 15 = -2. \]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{-2}\).","[-2, '-2']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",True
"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

Next, we substitute the coordinates of the point \((6, 0)\) into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator becomes:

\[
|10| = 10
\]

Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
d = 2 \sqrt{5}
\]

Thus, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is:

"To solve for the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we start by using Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

Expanding the right-hand side, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2.
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 2^2 = 4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 4 = t^3 - 4\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = \sqrt[3]{4}\), \(t = \omega \sqrt[3]{4}\), and \(t = \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{4}\), where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) is a primitive cube root of unity. Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

\[
\boxed{\{\sqrt[3]{4}, \omega \sqrt[3]{4}, \omega^2 \sqrt[3]{4}\}}.
\]","[{4**(1/3), 4**(1/3)*omega, 4**(1/3)*omega**2}, '\\{\\sqrt[3]{4}, \\omega \\sqrt[3]{4}, \\omega^2 \\sqrt[3]{4}\\}']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False
"To determine the cost of one lapis, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Identify the total cost of three lapis and one pambura:**
   \[
   3 \text{ lapis} + 1 \text{ pambura} = \$1.24
   \]

2. **Identify the total cost of two lapis and one pambura:**
   \[
   2 \text{ lapis} + 1 \text{ pambura} = \$1.82
   \]

3. **Subtract the second equation from the first equation to eliminate the pambura:**
   \[
   (3 \text{ lapis} + 1 \text{ pambura}) - (2 \text{ lapis} + 1 \text{ pambura}) = \$1.24 - \$1.82
   \]

4. **Simplify the left-hand side:**
   \[
   3 \text{ lapis} - 2 \text{ lapis} = 1 \text{ lapis}
   \]

5. **Simplify the right-hand side:**
   \[
   \$1.24 - \$1.82 = -\$0.58
   \]

6. ** Correct the sign since we subtracted the wrong way.**
   \[
   \text{ correct sign should be positive since we subtracted the wrong way.}

"To determine the last digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal. We do this by performing the division \(137 \div 500\).

First, we note that \(500 = 5 \times 100\). Therefore, we can rewrite the fraction as:
\[
\frac{137}{500} = \frac{137}{5 \times 100} = \frac{137}{5} \times \frac{1}{100}
\]

Next, we divide \(137\) by \(5\):
\[
137 \div 5 = 27.4
\]

Now, we multiply \(27.4\) by \(\frac{1}{100}\):
\[
27.4 \times \frac{1}{100} = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). The last digit in this decimal expansion is \(4\).

Thus, the last digit in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

Given:
- The rectangle \(ABCD\) has a center \(O\).
- The ratio of the lengths of the sides is \(AB/AD = k\).

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying each inequality:
1. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2\)
   \[
   0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
   \]
   \[
   2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
   \]

2. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2\)
   \[
   0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
   \]
   \[
   2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
   \]

3. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2\)
   \[
   0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2
   \]
   \[
   2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2
   \]
   \[
   ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
   \]

4. \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2\)
   \[
   0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2
   \]
   \[
   2ax + 2by > -a^2 - b^2
   \]
   \[
   ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
   \]

Combining these inequalities, we get:
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This represents a region inside the rectangle where the point \((x, y)\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices. This region is a square centered at \(O\) with side length \(a\sqrt{2}\).

The area of the square is:
\[
(a\sqrt{2})^2 = 2a^2
\]

The area of the rectangle is:
\[
2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{2a^2}{4ab} = \frac{a}{2b}
\]

Given \(AB/AD = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k
\]

Thus, the probability is:
\[
\frac{k}{k + 1}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.

   \]
   This means that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9.

2. Since 54 is exactly divisible by 6, the remainder is 0. This can be verified by multiplying the quotient by the divisor and subtracting the result from the original number:
   \[
   54 - (9 \times 6) = 54 - 54 = 0
   \]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total after selling their girl scout cookies, we need to add up the amounts each person earned. Let's do this step by step.

Next, we add the amount June earned to the result:
\[ 62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07 \]

Then, we add the amount Connie earned to the result:
\[ 100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59 \]

So, the total amount of money they have after selling the cookies is $126.59. Since they areipalit the money into a bank account, the amount of money they have in total is $126.59. The problem asks for the amount of money they have in total, so the answer is:

"To find the average (mean) of the pagsusulit scores in Ang's class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of all the scores. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

So, the total sum of the scores is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Now, let's do the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Next, we add these products together:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Now, we divide the total sum by the number of students, which is 30:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the average (mean) of the pagsusulit scores in Ang's class is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\

\]
The sum of the first row is:
\[

\]
The sum of the second row is:
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
The sum of the third row is:
\[

\]
The sum of the first column is:
\[

The sum of the second column is:

The sum of the third column is:

The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15

The sum of the other diagonal is:

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

1. Calculate the total number of talampakans Jim has.
2. Calculate the total number of talampakans Martha has.
3. Find the difference between the total number of talampakans Jim has and the total number of talampakans Martha has.

First, let's calculate the total number of talampakans Jim has. Jim has a buiding with 300 talampakans and a lapad with 400 talampakans. Therefore, the total number of talampakans Jim has is:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of talampakans Martha has. Martha has a buiding with 400 talampakans and a lapad with 300 talampakans. Therefore, the total number of talampakans Martha has is:
\[ 400 + 300 = 700 \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of talampakans Jim has and the total number of talampakans Martha has:
\[ 700 - 700 = 0 \]

So, Jim has \(\boxed{0}\) more talampakans than Martha.","[0, '0']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we get:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the distance between the point \( D \) and the point \( A \), we need to use the given distances and the properties of the triangles formed by the points \( A \), \( B \), \( C \), and \( D \).

First, let's list the given distances:
- \( DB = 3 \)
- \( AB = 6 \)
- \( AC = 6 \)
- \( DC = 4 \)
- \( AD = 5 \)
- \( CB = 5 \)

We are asked to find the distance \( AD \), which is already given as 5. However, let's verify this using the properties of the triangles.

Consider triangle \( ABD \):
- \( AB = 6 \)
- \( DB = 3 \)
- \( AD = 5 \)

We can check if these sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem:
1. \( AB + DB > AD \)

   \]
2. \( AB + AD > DB \)
   \[

   \]
3. \( DB + AD > AB \)
   \[
   3 + 5 > 6 \quad \text{(True)}

Since all the inequalities are satisfied, triangle \( ABD \) is valid.

Next, consider triangle \( ACD \):
- \( AC = 6 \)
- \( DC = 4 \)
- \( AD = 5 \)

We can check if these sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem:
1. \( AC + DC > AD \)
   \[
   6 + 4 > 5 \quad \text{(True)}
   \]
2. \( AC + AD > DC \)

   \]
3. \( DC + AD > AC \)
   \[
   4 + 5 > 6 \quad \text{(True)}
   \]

Since all the inequalities are satisfied, triangle \( ACD \) is valid.

Finally, consider triangle \( BCD \):
- \( BC = 5 \)
- \( DC = 4 \)
- \( DB = 3 \)

We can check if these sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem:
1. \( BC + DC > DB \)

Since all the inequalities are satisfied, triangle \( BCD \) is valid.
