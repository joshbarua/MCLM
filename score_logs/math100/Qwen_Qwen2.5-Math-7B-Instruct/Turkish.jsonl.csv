"To determine the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by using the definition of the sine function. The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. In triangle \(DEF\), \(\angle DFE = 90^\circ\), so \(\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF}\).

We are given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) and \(EF = 7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
\frac{7}{DF} = 0.7
\]
Multiplying both sides by \(DF\) gives:
\[
7 = 0.7 \cdot DF
\]
Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]
Now that we know \(DF = 10\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\(DF\)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\(DE\) and \(EF\)). Therefore, we have:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the squares, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
To isolate \(DE^2\), we subtract 49 from both sides:
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]
Thus, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) obtained by rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) radians is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of different ways 8 people can sit around a circular table, we need to consider that in a circular arrangement, rotations of the same arrangement are considered identical. This means that if we fix one person in one position, we can arrange the remaining people in the remaining seats.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Fix one person in one position**: Since the table is circular, we can fix one person in one position to eliminate the rotational symmetry. This leaves us with 7 people to arrange in the remaining 7 seats.
2. **Arrange the remaining people**: The number of ways to arrange 7 people in 7 seats is given by the factorial of 7, denoted as \(7!\).

The factorial of 7 is calculated as follows:
\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040

Therefore, the number of different ways 8 people can sit around a circular table is \(\boxed{5040}\).","[5040, '5040']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. For a term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Let's determine the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the general term becomes:

\[
\binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k} = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k}
\]

For the term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3} = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 (-1) \frac{1}{8} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot (-1) \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot -\frac{100}{8} = \binom{5}{3} \cdot -12.5
\]

We know that \(\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10\), so the constant term is:

\[
10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression modulo 7:
\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]
Simplify each term inside the parentheses:
\[
2 + 2 = 4, \quad 2 + 4 = 6, \quad 2 + 6 = 8
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[

\]
Now, calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):
\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:
\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{so} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine how many degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions where the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry position is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that the pentagon looks the same after being rotated by 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full 360 degrees. Therefore, the smallest angle by which the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is 72 degrees.

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\) where \(x > 7\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \((6, -1)\) cannot be the correct fourth vertex. Let's consider the possibility that the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting these midpoints equal gives:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8\) and \(y = 9\) satisfy the condition \(x > 7\), the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"Given that \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) in triangle \(ABC\), we know that \(\angle A + \angle C = 90^\circ\). This implies that \(\angle C = 90^\circ - \angle A\). We are also given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\).

We start by using the definition of sine and cosine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
From the given equation \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute the definitions of sine and cosine:
\[
\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Since the hypotenuse is the same on both sides, we can cancel it out:
\[
\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}
\]
The tangent of an angle is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

First, let's express \( A \bold{v} \) for a general vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} \):

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy).
\]

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy).

\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}

"Let's define the weight of a squig as \( S \) and the weight of a goolee as \( G \). According to the problem, we have the following two equations:

1. Three squigs and one goolee weigh the same as four squigs:
\[ 3S + G = 4S \]

2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
\[ 2T + G = S \]

First, let's solve the first equation for \( G \):
\[ 3S + G = 4S \]
Subtract \( 3S \) from both sides:
\[ G = S \]

Now we substitute \( G = S \) into the second equation:
\[ 2T + S = S \]
Subtract \( S \) from both sides:
\[ 2T = 0 \]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[ T = 0 \]

This result indicates that the weight of a treek is zero. Therefore, the total weight of any number of treeks is zero. Specifically, the total weight of three treeks is:
\[ 3T = 3 \times 0 = 0 \]

Since the weight of a squig is \( S \), the total weight of three treeks is equal to the weight of zero squigs. However, the problem asks how many treeks' total weight is equal to the weight of one squig.

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, we perform each multiplication:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. For \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. For \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

First, solve for \(a\) from the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation for \(t^2\) to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is correct.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the equation for \(t\) to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This is correct.

Since all equations are satisfied, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per second and that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per second. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) cubic meters per second, and the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per second.

We can use the chain rule to relate the rates of change of volume and height:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since the volume \( V \) is \( \pi r^2 h \), the derivative of \( V \) with respect to \( h \) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Finally, we solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

### Step 1: Analyze the function for \(x \geq a\)
For \(x \geq a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards with its vertex at the origin if \(a > 0\). If \(a < 0\), the parabola opens downwards. The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this region occurs at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
So, for \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\), and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

### Step 2: Analyze the function for \(x < a\)
For \(x < a\), the function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). The value of the function at \(x = a\) is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]
So, for \(x < a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) if \(a > 0\), and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) if \(a < 0\).

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the intervals \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) (if \(a > 0\)) or \((-\infty, a^3]\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) (if \(a < 0\)) must cover all real numbers. This means that the two intervals must overlap.

#### Case 1: \(a > 0\)
For \(a > 0\), the intervals are \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For these intervals to overlap, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \([2, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((0, 2]\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) in this case is \(a = 2\).

#### Case 2: \(a < 0\)
For \(a < 0\), the intervals are \((-\infty, a^3]\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\). For these intervals to overlap, we need:
\[ a^2 + 2a \leq a^3. \]
Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0. \]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([-1, 0)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find that the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) is satisfied in the interval \((-\infty, -1]\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) in this case is \(a = -1\).

"为了确定方程 \(x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\) 与半径为1的圆对应的 \(c\) 的值，我们需要将方程重写为圆的标准方程形式，即 \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\)。

首先，我们对 \(x\) 和 \(y\) 的项完成平方。

从 \(x\) 的项开始：
\[x^2 - 10x\]
为了完成平方，我们取 \(x\) 的系数的一半，即 \(-10\)，除以2得到 \(-5\)，然后平方得到 \(25\)。因此，我们可以将 \(x^2 - 10x\) 重写为：
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25\]

接下来，对于 \(y\) 的项：
\[y^2 + 6y\]
为了完成平方，我们取 \(y\) 的系数的一半，即 \(6\)，除以2得到 \(3\)，然后平方得到 \(9\)。因此，我们可以将 \(y^2 + 6y\) 重写为：
\[y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9\]

现在，将这些完成的平方项代回原方程：
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0\]
合并常数项：
\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0\]
重新排列以将常数项隔离在方程的另一边：
\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\]

方程 \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) 现在是圆的标准方程形式，其中圆心是 \((5, -3)\)，半径 \(r\) 满足 \(r^2 = 34 - c\)。已知半径为1，所以：
\[1^2 = 34 - c\]
\[1 = 34 - c\]
解 \(c\)：
\[c = 34 - 1\]
\[c = 33\]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2, i.e., \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).
For \(x = 0\) to be a solution, it must not be a periodic point of period 2, so we discard it. We focus on the second case:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point, so it must not be a solution to this equation. Let's substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation and check:
\[

This confirms that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is indeed a fixed point, so we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there are other solutions to the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). By analyzing the polynomial, we find that the polynomial has a double root at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) when \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(2x^2 - 2x + 1) = 2(4x^3 - 4x^2 + 2x - 4x^4 + 4x^3 - 2x^2) = 2(-4x^4 + 8x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x) = -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x.
\]
Setting \(f(f(x)) = x\), we get:
\[
-8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 4x = x \implies -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or the roots of the cubic polynomial \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots and find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. Factoring out \(x - \frac{1}{2}\), we get:
\[
-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = -8\left(x - \frac{1}{2}\right)\left(x^2 - \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{8}\right).
\]
The quadratic \(x^2 - \frac{3}{2}x + \frac{3}{8}\) has discriminant \(\left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot \frac{3}{8} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{4} - \frac{6}{4} = \frac{3}{4}\), which is positive, so it has two distinct real roots. Therefore, the cubic polynomial has three real roots, one of which is \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), and the other two are not equal to 0 or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) for \(\lambda = 2\). This means that for \(\lambda = 2\), there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

For \(\lambda \neq 2\), the polynomial \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1\) does not have a double root at \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), so it does not have three real roots. Therefore, for \(\lambda \neq 2\), there does not exist an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original equation:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\), to express the right-hand side in a different form. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the tangent of a specific angle. By inspection or using known values, we find that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 35^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider the fact that some of the letters are repeated. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter E appears 4 times, the letter L appears 2 times, and the letters I and P each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- \( n = 8 \) (total letters)
- \( n_1 = 4 \) (for E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for L)
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for I)
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for P)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{8!}{4! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320 \)
- \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

Since there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

First, we calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in terms that are 0, we stop here. Adding these values together, we get:

Let \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) where \( \theta \) is a real number. This substitution is valid because \( \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \), which satisfies the domain constraints.

Substituting \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) into the function, we get:
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}
\]
Since \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \) (assuming \( \cos \theta \ge 0 \) and \( \sin \theta \ge 0 \) for simplicity, but the analysis will hold for all \( \theta \) due to symmetry), the function simplifies to:
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]
This shows that the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1 for any \( \theta \), or equivalently, for any \( (x, y) \) on the unit circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

To confirm that 1 is indeed the maximum value, we need to check the boundary conditions. If \( x = \pm 1 \), then \( y = 0 \), and the function becomes:
\[
f(\pm 1, 0) = \pm 1 \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - (\pm 1)^2} = \pm 1

In both cases, the function value is either 1 or -1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line segment parallel to the base. Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \).

Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is:

"To determine the number of beŞlik in Hillary's collection, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equation based on the given information.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of beŞlik.
- \( y \) as the number of hepsi onluk.
- \( z \) as the number of bir madani paras.

From the problem, we know the following:
1. The total number of items in the collection is 75.
2. Each beŞlik is worth 5 sent.
3. Each hepsi onluk is worth 10 sent.
4. Each bir madani paras is worth 15 sent.

The total value of the collection is given by the equation:
\[ 5x + 10y + 15z = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + 2y + 3z = 15 \]

We also know that the total number of items is:
\[ x + y + z = 75 \]

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the problem statement. Let's recheck the problem statement and correct it if necessary. The correct total value should be 75 sent value for the items.

 correct total value should be 75 sent value for the items.

 correct total value should be 75 sent value for the items.

 correct total value should be 75 sent value for the items.

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. They are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two chosen numbers is even. This can happen in two ways:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

There is only one even number (2), so the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers is:

\[
\binom{1}{2} = 0
\]

There are five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13), so the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers is:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

\[
0 + 10 = 10
\]

The probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is:

Next, isolate the term with $b$ by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:
\[2b = 12 - 12\]
\[2b = 0\]

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the shaded triangles.

The diagram consists of a grid with a vertical line at \(x=2\) and a horizontal line at \(y=4\). The shaded region is composed of two right triangles:
1. The triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
2. The triangle with vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

First, let's calculate the area of the first triangle:
- The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
- The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.
- The area of a triangle is given by the formula \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
- Therefore, the area of the first triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4\) square units.

Next, let's calculate the area of the second triangle:
- The base of the triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 4 units.
- The height of the triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 3 units.
- The area of a triangle is given by the formula \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
- Therefore, the area of the second triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times 4 \times 3 = 6\) square units.

Finally, we add the areas of the two triangles to find the total area of the shaded region:
\[ 4 + 6 = 10 \]

Thus, the total area of the shaded region is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This is because a number ending in 00 is divisible by 100, and thus by \(5^2 = 25\).

Next, we need to ensure that the number contains at least one factor of 2. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last digit must be 0, and the second last digit must also be 0 to satisfy the factor of 2. Therefore, the number must end in 00.

Now, we need to ensure that the number contains at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits will be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, the number must contain at least two 1's.

Combining these conditions, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 1100. Let's verify:

- The number 1100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- The number 1100 contains two 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 1100 is not a valid solution.

We need to find a larger number. Let's try 101100. Let's verify:

- The number 101100 ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- The number 101100 contains three 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.
- The number 101100 contains one factor of 2, so it is divisible by 2.

Since 101100 meets all the criteria, it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that the dama tash will be placed in a square that is not shaded, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the possible outcomes for each number rolled:**
   - The first number rolled is divided by 4, and the remainder can be 1, 2, or 3. This means there are 3 possible outcomes for the first number.
   - The second number rolled is divided by 5, and the remainder can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means there are 4 possible outcomes for the second number.

2. **Calculate the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since the rolls are independent, the total number of possible outcomes is the product of the number of outcomes for each roll.
   \[
   3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - A square is not shaded if the first number rolled is not 4 and the second number rolled is not 5. However, since the possible remainders for the first number are 1, 2, or 3, and the possible remainders for the second number are 1, 2, 3, or 4, all possible outcomes are favorable.
   - Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is 12.

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that the dama tash will be placed in a square that is not shaded is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes.
   \[
   \frac{12}{12} = 1
   \]

However, the problem states that the dama tash is placed in the square where the row and column intersect, and we need to consider the probability that this square is not shaded. The correct approach is to consider the probability that the row and column are not shaded.

The correct approach is to consider the probability that the row and column are not shaded. The correct answer is:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

"To find the value of the expression \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}
\]

We know that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = 1 - \cos^2 20^\circ\), but a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

"To determine the shape of the surface defined by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) represents the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis, \( \theta \) represents the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, and \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane. The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is constant for all points on the surface. This describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the shape of the surface defined by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Since we are asked for the smallest angle, the answer is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by recalling that the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\).

Given the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Now, consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x + 5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( x + 5 = r_i \) for some root \( r_i \) of \( f(x) \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15
\]

Since \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
49 - 15 = 34

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.
\]

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\). Squaring both sides of the equation \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ) = (3\sqrt{3})^2\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(-\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}) = 27,

Since \(\tan^2 80^\circ = \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.

Since \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + 2 + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
4 + 2(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ) - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
2(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ) - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 29,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - \sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 14.5.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 14.5,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 14.5 - 2 = 12.5.
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.5.
\]

Finally, we substitute this back into our expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 12.5 = 15.5.

"To determine the number of sides of a heptagon where the sum of the interior angles excluding one is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of an \(n\)-sided polygon, which is given by:

\[
180(n-2)
\]

Let's denote the measure of the excluded interior angle by \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
180(n-2) - x = 1070
\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 180(n-2) - 1070
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a heptagon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\). Therefore, we need to find the value of \(n\) such that:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

First, we solve the inequality \(0 < 180(n-2) - 1070\):

\[
180(n-2) > 1070
\]
\[
n-2 > \frac{1070}{180}
\]
\[
n-2 > 5.9444
\]
\[
n > 7.9444

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have \(n \geq 8\).

Next, we solve the inequality \(180(n-2) - 1070 < 180\):

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]
\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]
\[
n-2 < 6.9444
\]
\[
n < 8.9444

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have \(n \leq 8\).

"To solve for the odd integer \( t \) such that \( t+2 \) and \( t \) are both third roots of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by setting up the congruences:

\]
\[
t^3 \equiv t \pmod{23}

First, we simplify the second congruence:

\[
t^3 \equiv t \pmod{23}
\]

Subtract \( t \) from both sides:

\[
t^3 - t \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

Factor out \( t \):

\[
t(t^2 - 1) \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This gives us three possible solutions:

\[
t \equiv 0 \pmod{23}, \quad t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \quad t \equiv -1 \pmod{23}
\]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \). Thus, we have:

\[
t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \quad \text{or} \quad t \equiv 22 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we check which of these values satisfy the first congruence:

\[
(t+2)^3 \equiv t \pmod{23}
\]

**Case 1: \( t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \)**

Substitute \( t = 1 \):

\[

\]
\[
3^3 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

\[
27 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}

Since \( 27 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \), \( t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \) does not satisfy the first congruence.

**Case 2: \( t \equiv 22 \pmod{23} \)**

Substitute \( t = 22 \):

\[
(22+2)^3 \equiv 22 \pmod{23}

\[

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a side length of 1 inch, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the area of one face of the cube:**
   Each face of a cube is a square. The area \( A \) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \text{side length}^2

"要找到 \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) sayisorsine standi根ine的乘积，我们首先需要确定 standi根ine。一个 sayisorsine standi根ine \(a + \sqrt{b}\) is \(a - \sqrt{b}\). Therefore, the standi root of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we need to find the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and \(5 - \sqrt{3}\). This can be done using the difference of squares formula, which states that \((x + y)(x - y) = x^2 - y^2\). Here, \(x = 5\) and \(y = \sqrt{3}\).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

However, we know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\). Therefore, the equation \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is a contradiction. This means there are no values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of integer coordinate points within the rectangle defined by the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that lie strictly inside the rectangle. This means we exclude the boundary points.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points on the rectangle are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of the points strictly inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This gives us the possible integer values for \(x\) as:
\[

There are 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the points on the rectangle are \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the \(y\)-coordinates of the points strictly inside the rectangle must satisfy:

This gives us the possible integer values for \(y\) as:

To find the total number of integer coordinate points inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible integer values for \(x\) by the number of possible integer values for \(y\):

Thus, the number of integer coordinate points within the rectangle is \(\boxed{63}\).","[63, '63']",63,"[63, '63']",True
"To find the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[

\]

Next, we use the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, which states that for any vector \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and scalar \(k\),

\[
k \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} = (k \mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = \mathbf{u} \times (k \mathbf{v}).
\]

Applying this property, we get:

\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
2 \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}),

\[
\mathbf{a} \times 3 \mathbf{c} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]
\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}.
\]

Substituting these into our expression, we have:

\[

\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) - 2 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into our expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},

\[

\[

Adding these vectors together, we get:

Therefore, the value of \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\) is:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar triangles by the Angle Bisector Theorem. This means that the ratio of the corresponding sides of these triangles is equal. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{CD}{CD + AB}
\]
However, since \(CD = h\) and \(AB\) is the other base of the trapezoid, we can simplify this to:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{h}{h + AB}
\]
Since \(AB\) is not directly given, we can use the area of the trapezoid to find a relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b)h = 84
\]

Now, let's consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the area of the trapezoid:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD + \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are equal. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ACD = \frac{42}{2} = 21

   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9

   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19} = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To solve the operation \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) using the given definition \(\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)\), we need to substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the formula.

First, let's substitute the values into the formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication of the integers:
\[
(7)(10) = 70

Now, we multiply 70 by \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \cdot 21}{30}

We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{70 \cdot 21}{30}\) by canceling out the common factors. First, let's simplify the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is \(70 \cdot 21 = 1470\) and the denominator is 30. We can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 30:
\[
\frac{1470 \div 30}{30 \div 30} = \frac{49}{1} = 49

"To determine the probability that the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect, we start by considering the properties of a circle and the placement of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on its circumference.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A circle has a continuous circumference.
   - Points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on this circumference.
   - We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect.

2. **Geometric Interpretation:**
   - Two line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged such that one pair of points (e.g., \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (e.g., \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

3. **Counting Arrangements:**
   - There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we must divide by 4 to account for rotational symmetry. This gives us \(\frac{4!}{4} = 6\) distinct arrangements of the points.

4. **Identifying Intersecting Arrangements:**
   - We need to count how many of these 6 arrangements result in intersecting line segments.
   - Consider the points labeled in clockwise order as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). The intersecting arrangements are:
     - \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\)
     - \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\)
   - There are 2 such intersecting arrangements.

5. **Calculating the Probability:**
   - The probability of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Here, the number of favorable outcomes (intersecting arrangements) is 2, and the total number of possible outcomes (distinct arrangements) is 6.
   - Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the probability that the lines \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To find the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the given area of the shaded region.

The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of a sector of the larger circle and a sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]
The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two sectors:
\[
2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
\]
We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{2}{5}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]
The measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees is:
\[

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the beaker and the tank and then find out how many times the volume of the beaker fits into the volume of the tank.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the beaker fits into the volume of the tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}.
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{(0.5 - 0.4) \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{0.1 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}.
\]

Finally, we multiply \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}) \sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2 \sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500}.
\]

We can factor out a 3 from the numerator:
\[
\frac{6 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{500} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 125} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 5^3} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 5^2 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{4 \cdot 25 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{100 \cdot 5} = \frac{3 (2 \sqrt{7} + 7)}{500}.

First, we know the following conversion factors:

We start by converting feet to inches. Since the bisiklet is traveling 20 feet per minute, we multiply 20 by 12 to find out how many inches it travels in one minute:
\[ 20 \text{ ft/min} \times 12 \text{ in/ft} = 240 \text{ in/min} \]

Next, we convert minutes to seconds. Since there are 60 seconds in one minute, we divide 240 by 60 to find out how many inches it travels in one second:
\[ 240 \text{ in/min} \div 60 \text{ s/min} = 4 \text{ in/s} \]

"To determine the number of different 5-member subcommittees that can be formed from a committee of 8Cumhri yeti and 6 Demokrat, where each subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that do not meet the requirement (i.e., subcommittees that are all from one party).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee from the 14 members (8Cumhri yeti and 6 Demokrat):
\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that is all from the Cumhri yeti:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member subcommittee that is all from the Demokrat:
\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = 6

Now, subtract the number of subcommittees that are all from one party from the total number of subcommittees to find the number of subcommittees that include at least one member from each party:
\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

"To find the three consecutive integers whose product is 120, we start by letting the three integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). According to the problem, their product is:

\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

We also know that when this product is divided by the average of these three integers, the result is 24. The average of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, we can write the equation:

\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides, we get:

\[

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5

To verify, we check the product of these integers:

\[

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) where \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). This polynomial can be derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{\text{constant term}}{\text{leading coefficient}} = \frac{1}{8}\). However, this product includes all five roots of the polynomial \(8x^5 - 1 = 0\) except \(x = 1\), so we need to divide by \(\cos \left( \frac{0 \cdot 2\pi}{15} \right) = 1\). Therefore, the product of the roots \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{8}\).

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\), we have:

We are also given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

In triangle \(BDC\), since \(D\) lies on \(AM\), \(BD\) and \(CD\) are equal to the hypotenuses of right triangles \(BDM\) and \(CDM\) respectively. Using the Pythagorean theorem in these triangles, we get:
\[BD = \sqrt{BM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\]
\[CD = \sqrt{CM^2 + DM^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{x^2 + 1}\]

Since \(BD = CD\), triangle \(BDC\) is isosceles with \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). The base angles of an isosceles triangle are equal, so \(\angle DBC = \angle DCB = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2}\).

In triangle \(ABC\), \(\angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2}\). Since \(D\) lies on \(AM\), \(\angle ABD = \angle ABC - \angle DBC = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} - \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} = \theta\). Similarly, \(\angle ACD = \theta\).

This means that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) is consistent with the angles in triangle \(BDC\). Now, we need to find the value of \(x\).

\[BC^2 = x^2 + 1 + x^2 + 1 - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta)\]
\[BC^2 = 2x^2 + 2 - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta)\]
Since \(BC = 2x\), we have:
\[4x^2 = 2x^2 + 2 - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta)\]
\[2x^2 = 2 - 2(x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta)\]
\[x^2 = 1 - (x^2 + 1) \cos(3\theta)\]
\[x^2 = 1 - x^2 \cos(3\theta) - \cos(3\theta)\]
\[x^2 + x^2 \cos(3\theta) = 1 - \cos(3\theta)\]
\[x^2(1 + \cos(3\theta)) = 1 - \cos(3\theta)\]
\[x^2 = \frac{1 - \cos(3\theta)}{1 + \cos(3\theta)}\]

\[x^2 = \frac{1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)}{1 + 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)}\]
\[x^2 = \frac{(1 + \cos(\theta))(1 - 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2\cos(\theta))}{(1 - \cos(\theta))(1 + 2\cos^2(\theta) + 2\cos(\theta))}\]
\[x^2 = \frac{(1 + \cos(\theta))(1 - 2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^2(\theta))}{(1 - \cos(\theta))(1 + 2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^2(\theta))}\]

Therefore, the side lengths of triangle \(ABC\) are \(AB = AC = \sqrt{121 + 10^2} = \sqrt{221}\) and \(BC = 2x = 20\).

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{221} + \sqrt{221} + 20 = 2\sqrt{221} + 20\]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the sum of the first \(n\) consecutive integers:**
   The sum \(S\) of the first \(n\) consecutive integers starting from \(a\) is given by:
   \[
   S = \frac{n}{2} \left(2a + (n-1)d\right)
   \]
   where \(d\) is the common difference. For consecutive integers, \(d = 1\).

2. **Set up the equation for the given sum:**
   Given that the sum of 27 consecutive integers is \(3^7\), we substitute \(n = 27\) and \(d = 1\) into the sum formula:
   \[
   3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right)
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   First, calculate \(3^7\):
   \[
   3^7 = 2187
   \]
   Substitute \(2187\) into the equation:
   \[
   2187 = \frac{27}{2} \left(2a + 26\right)
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 2 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4374 = 27 \left(2a + 26\right)
   \]
   Divide both sides by 27:
   \[
   162 = 2a + 26
   \]

4. **Solve for \(a\):**
   Subtract 26 from both sides:
   \[
   136 = 2a
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   a = 68
   \]

5. **Find the median:**
   The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. For 27 integers, the middle number is the 14th term. The \(k\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_k = a + (k-1)d
   \]
   For the 14th term (\(k = 14\)):
   \[
   a_{14} = 68 + (14-1) \cdot 1

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals determined by the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \). However, since \(y = x^2 \geq 0\), we only need to consider the interval \( [0, 3) \).

For \(0 \leq y < 3\), the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) is negative. Therefore, the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) holds for \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we have:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the results from both steps, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Thus, the solution in interval notation is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by using the given equations and some algebraic identities. The equations are:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use another identity to express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]

Now, let's denote \(x+y+z\) by \(s\) and \(xy + yz + zx\) by \(p\). The equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

We also know from the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) into this equation, we get:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(sp = 24\), we get:
\[
4p = 24,
\]
so
\[
p = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the number of male students who traveled by bus closest to 135% of the number of female students who traveled by bus, we need to calculate the number of male and female students who traveled by bus for each class and then find the ratio of the number of male students to the number of female students. We will compare this ratio to 1.35 (which is the decimal equivalent of 135%).

Let's start with the calculations for each class:

1. **9th Class:**
   - Number of male students who traveled by bus: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of female students who traveled by bus: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.042\)

2. **10th Class:**
   - Number of male students who traveled by bus: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Number of female students who traveled by bus: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.040\)

3. **11th Class:**
   - Number of male students who traveled by bus: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of female students who traveled by bus: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

4. **12th Class:**
   - Number of male students who traveled by bus: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of female students who traveled by bus: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio of male to female students: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

Now, we compare the ratios to 1.35:
- For the 9th class: \(1.042\)
- For the 10th class: \(1.040\)
- For the 11th class: \(1.5\)
- For the 12th class: \(1.344\)

The ratio for the 12th class is the closest to 1.35. Therefore, the class with the number of male students who traveled by bus closest to 135% of the number of female students who traveled by bus is the 12th class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the expression is undefined, which are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the denominator is zero, so the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

Let the length of the rectangle be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters. The track consists of two straight sides of length \( l \) and two semicircles with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \). The total length of the track is given as 400 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation for the perimeter of the track as:

\[
2l + 2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = 400
\]

Simplifying the equation, we get:

\[
2l + \pi w = 400

Solving for \( l \) in terms of \( w \), we have:

\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi w}{2}

\[
A = l \cdot w

Substituting the expression for \( l \) into the area formula, we get:

\[
A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi w}{2}\right) w = \frac{400w - \pi w^2}{2} = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:

\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0

Solving for \( w \), we get:

\[
w = \frac{200}{\pi}

\[
l = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100

\[
A = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by identifying the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(R\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) means that the side opposite angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Given that \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Since \(RST\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

"To find the minimum distance from a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) to the origin, we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from a point \((x, y)\) on the curve to the origin. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Simplify each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
\]

Substitute these values back into the function:

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that \( D = \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we identify \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us one solution \( x = 0 \), but since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We need to solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us two solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \), but since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid. Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ 2^3 - 2(2^2) - 3(2) + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Since \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), it is not a valid solution. We need to factor \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 \) using synthetic division or polynomial division. However, since we already found that \( x = -3 \) and \( x = 2 \) are not valid solutions for \( x > 3 \), we can conclude that there is no solution for \( f(x) = 6 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

The answer is:
\[ \boxed{0} \]","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, given the distances to the other five vertices. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) and the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as:
\[
PA = 3, \quad PB = 7, \quad PC = 8, \quad PD = 9, \quad PE = 11
\]

Since the octahedron is regular, the edge length \( s \) is the same for all edges. We can use the distance formula to express these distances in terms of \( x, y, z \) and \( s \):
\[
PA^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
PB^2 = (x + s)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
PC^2 = x^2 + (y + s)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
PD^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z + s)^2 = 81
\]
\[
PE^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z - s)^2 = 121
\]

We need to find the distance \( PF \), which is given by:
\[
PF^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z + s)^2
\]

First, let's subtract the equation for \( PA^2 \) from the equation for \( PB^2 \):
\[
PB^2 - PA^2 = (x + s)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x + s)^2 - x^2 = 40
\]
\[
x^2 + 2sx + s^2 - x^2 = 40
\]
\[
2sx + s^2 = 40
\]
\[
s(2x + s) = 40 \quad \text{(1)}
\]

Next, subtract the equation for \( PA^2 \) from the equation for \( PC^2 \):
\[
PC^2 - PA^2 = x^2 + (y + s)^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 64 - 9
\]
\[
(y + s)^2 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
y^2 + 2ys + s^2 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
2ys + s^2 = 55 \quad \text{(2)}
\]

Next, subtract the equation for \( PA^2 \) from the equation for \( PD^2 \):
\[
PD^2 - PA^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z + s)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 81 - 9
\]
\[
(z + s)^2 - z^2 = 72
\]
\[
z^2 + 2zs + s^2 - z^2 = 72
\]
\[
2zs + s^2 = 72 \quad \text{(3)}
\]

Next, subtract the equation for \( PA^2 \) from the equation for \( PE^2 \):
\[
PE^2 - PA^2 = x^2 + y^2 + (z - s)^2 - (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 121 - 9
\]
\[
(z - s)^2 - z^2 = 112
\]
\[
z^2 - 2zs + s^2 - z^2 = 112
\]
\[
-2zs + s^2 = 112 \quad \text{(4)}
\]

Now, we have four equations:
\[
s(2x + s) = 40 \quad \text{(1)}
\]
\[
2ys + s^2 = 55 \quad \text{(2)}
\]
\[
2zs + s^2 = 72 \quad \text{(3)}
\]
\[
-2zs + s^2 = 112 \quad \text{(4)}
\]

From equations (3) and (4), add them together:
\[
(2zs + s^2) + (-2zs + s^2) = 72 + 112
\]
\[
2s^2 = 184
\]
\[
s^2 = 92
\]
\[
s = \sqrt{92} = 2\sqrt{23}
\]

Substitute \( s = 2\sqrt{23} \) back into equation (1):
\[
2\sqrt{23}(2x + 2\sqrt{23}) = 40
\]
\[
4\sqrt{23}x + 92 = 40
\]
\[
4\sqrt{23}x = 40 - 92
\]
\[
4\sqrt{23}x = -52
\]
\[
x = \frac{-52}{4\sqrt{23}} = \frac{-13}{\sqrt{23}} = -\frac{13\sqrt{23}}{23}
\]

Substitute \( s = 2\sqrt{23} \) back into equation (2):
\[
2y(2\sqrt{23}) + 92 = 55
\]
\[
4y\sqrt{23} + 92 = 55
\]
\[
4y\sqrt{23} = 55 - 92
\]
\[
4y\sqrt{23} = -37
\]
\[
y = \frac{-37}{4\sqrt{23}} = \frac{-37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{4 \cdot 23} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\sqrt{23}}{92} = -\frac{37\]

"To solve the problem, we need to use the formula for the center of mass of a system of two objects. The center of mass of two objects with masses \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) located at positions \( x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) respectively is given by:

\[
x_{\text{cm}} = \frac{m_1 x_1 + m_2 x_2}{m_1 + m_2}
\]

In this problem, we are given the masses of the softball and the Beyzaol, but not their positions. However, we are asked to find the ratio of the ivmetry of Jen's top to the ivmetry of Jack's top. Since the positions of the softball and the Beyzaol are not specified, we can assume that the center of mass of each top is simply the position of the center of mass of the system of the softball and the Beyzaol.

Let's denote the mass of the softball as \( m_s = 200 \) g and the mass of the Beyzaol as \( m_b = 150 \) g. The center of mass of Jen's top is:

\[
x_{\text{cm}, \text{Jen}} = \frac{m_s x_s + m_b x_b}{m_s + m_b} = \frac{200 x_s + 150 x_b}{200 + 150} = \frac{200 x_s + 150 x_b}{350} = \frac{4 x_s + 3 x_b}{7}
\]

Similarly, the center of mass of Jack's top is:

\[
x_{\text{cm}, \text{Jack}} = \frac{m_s x_s + m_b x_b}{m_s + m_b} = \frac{200 x_s + 150 x_b}{200 + 150} = \frac{200 x_s + 150 x_b}{350} = \frac{4 x_s + 3 x_b}{7}
\]

Since the center of mass of Jen's top and Jack's top are the same, the ratio of the ivmetry of Jen's top to the ivmetry of Jack's top is:

\[
\frac{x_{\text{cm}, \text{Jen}}}{x_{\text{cm}, \text{Jack}}} = \frac{\frac{4 x_s + 3 x_b}{7}}{\frac{4 x_s + 3 x_b}{7}} = 1
\]

Therefore, the ratio of the ivmetry of Jen's top to the ivmetry of Jack's top is:

"To determine how many common digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) has the digits: 1, 5, 5, 6
- \(1165_8\) has the digits: 1, 1, 6, 5

The common digits are: 1, 5, 6

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

There are 3 common digits: 1, 5, and 6.

"To determine the number of toyalasma that occurred in the topol, we need to consider the following information:

1. There are 6 children and 4 adults in the topol.
2. Each child has a toy, and they each want to toyalasma with one adult.
3. Each adult has a toy, and they each want to toyalasma with one child.
4. No child toyalasms with another child, and no adult toyalasms with another adult.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Child to Adult Toyalasms:**
   - Each of the 6 children wants to toyalasma with one adult.
   - Since there are 4 adults, only 4 children can toyalasma with an adult.
   - Therefore, the number of child to adult toyalasms is 4.

2. **Adult to Child Toyalasms:**
   - Each of the 4 adults wants to toyalasma with one child.
   - Since there are 6 children, only 4 adults can toyalasma with a child.
   - Therefore, the number of adult to child toyalasms is 4.

Adding the number of child to adult toyalasms and adult to child toyalasms gives us the total number of toyalasms:

Thus, the total number of toyalasma that occurred in the topol is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by noting that the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is \( g(1) \).

Since \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we have:

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:

\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). By rearranging terms, we get:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point given is \((6, 0)\), so \(x_1 = 6\) and \(y_1 = 0\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we have:

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\[

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

We also know that:
\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]
Substituting \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = -2 - (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)\) into the equation, we get:
\[
(-2 - (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4))(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]
Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 = -a - b\), we have:
\[
-2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 = -a - b.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
a + b = (\alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 + 2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
Similarly, we can find:
\[
a + c = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_4)^2 + 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_4),

\[
b + c = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)^2 + 2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2).

Since \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we can express \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2\), \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_4\), \(\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\), \(\alpha_2 + \alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4\) in terms of each other. For example, if we let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = x\), then \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 - x\). Substituting this into the equation for \(a + b\), we get:
\[
a + b = (-2 - x)^2 + 2(-2 - x) = 4 + 4x + x^2 - 4 - 2x = x^2 + 2x.
\]
Similarly, we can find:
\[
a + c = y^2 + 2y,
\]
\[
b + c = z^2 + 2z,
\]
where \(y = \alpha_1 + \alpha_4\) and \(z = \alpha_2 + \alpha_3\). Since \(x + y + z = -2\), we can see that \(x^2 + 2x\), \(y^2 + 2y\), and \(z^2 + 2z\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 4t + 4 = 0\). Solving this polynomial, we find the roots to be \(t = 2\), \(t = -1 + i\), and \(t = -1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one pencil, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the cost of one pencil in dollars.
- Let \( y \) be the cost of one jumbo silgi in dollars.

We are given two equations based on the information provided:
1. Three pencils and one jumbo silgi cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3x + y = 1.24
   \]
2. Five pencils and one jumbo silgi cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5x + y = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( y \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
2x = 0.58
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

Thus, the cost of one pencil is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:
\[
0.29 \times 100 = 29
\]

Therefore, the cost of one pencil is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True
"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's go through the division step by step.

1. **Set up the division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. Since 137 is less than 500, we will start by adding decimal places to 137. This can be written as 137.000.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - **First digit after the decimal point**: 500 goes into 1370 two times (since \(500 \times 2 = 1000\)). So, we write 2 in the first digit after the decimal point.
     \[
     1370 - 1000 = 370
     \]
     Now, we bring down the next 0, making it 3700.
   - **Second digit after the decimal point**: 500 goes into 3700 seven times (since \(500 \times 7 = 3500\)). So, we write 7 in the second digit after the decimal point.
     \[
     3700 - 3500 = 200
     \]
     Now, we bring down the next 0, making it 2000.
   - **Third digit after the decimal point**: 500 goes into 2000 four times (since \(500 \times 4 = 2000\)). So, we write 4 in the third digit after the decimal point.
     \[
     2000 - 2000 = 0
     \]
     Now, there are no more digits to bring down, and the division is complete.

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is 0.274. The ondalıklı��'s right side has the digits 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit is 4.

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
- \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
- \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)
- \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(B\) is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(C\) is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(D\) is:
\[
\sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4} \implies 0 < ax - by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4} \implies 0 < -ax - by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 + by + \frac{b^2}{4} \implies 0 < -ax + by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 + by + \frac{b^2}{4} \implies 0 < ax + by + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4} \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle. The region where all four inequalities are satisfied is the intersection of these regions, which forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a}{2}\) and \(\frac{b}{2}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \frac{a}{2} \times \frac{b}{2} = \frac{ab}{4}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = a \times b
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{ab}{4}}{ab} = \frac{1}{4}

Thus, the probability is:

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:

This means that 6 fits into 54 exactly 9 times. To find the remainder, we multiply 6 by 9 and subtract the result from 54:
\[6 \times 9 = 54\]

"To solve the expression \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \) using the given piecewise function \( f(n) \), we need to evaluate each term separately based on the value of \( n \).

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function \( \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the floor function \( \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True

   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

First, we calculate the total score for each group of students:
- For the 20 students who scored 80, the total score is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- For the 8 students who scored 90, the total score is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- For the 2 students who scored 100, the total score is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote the numbers in the magic square as follows:

\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
a & b & c \\
\hline
d & e & f \\
\hline
g & h & i \\
\hline
\end{array}
\]

Given that the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal is the same, we can set up the following equations:

1. Sum of the first row: \( a + b + c \)
2. Sum of the second row: \( d + e + f \)
3. Sum of the third row: \( g + h + i \)
4. Sum of the first column: \( a + d + g \)
5. Sum of the second column: \( b + e + h \)
6. Sum of the third column: \( c + f + i \)
7. Sum of the main diagonal: \( a + e + i \)
8. Sum of the other diagonal: \( c + e + g \)

Since all these sums are equal, let's denote this common sum by \( S \). Therefore, we have:

\[
a + b + c = S
\]
\[
d + e + f = S
\]
\[
g + h + i = S
\]
\[
a + d + g = S
\]
\[
b + e + h = S
\]
\[
c + f + i = S
\]
\[
a + e + i = S
\]
\[
c + e + g = S
\]

To find \( S \), we can add all the numbers in the magic square. Since there are 9 numbers, and each number appears exactly once in the sum of all rows, columns, and diagonals, we have:

\[
(a + b + c) + (d + e + f) + (g + h + i) = 3S
\]

The sum of all the numbers in the magic square is:

\[
a + b + c + d + e + f + g + h + i
\]

Given that the numbers in the magic square are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \), their sum is:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
3S = 45
\]

Solving for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \( n \). Since \( n \) is one of the numbers in the magic square, and the numbers are \( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 \), \( n \) must be one of these values. Given the problem's context and the properties of a magic square, we can conclude that \( n \) is the center number \( e \).

In a 3x3 magic square, the center number is always the average of the smallest and largest numbers. Therefore:

\[

"To determine how much farther Martha travels compared to Jim, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim travels along the diagonal of the rectangle. The formula for the length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha travels along the length and the width of the rectangle. The total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[ \text{Distance} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]
So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Martha and Jim:
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet} \]
Therefore, Jim travels 200 feet less than Martha. The answer is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). They satisfy the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, we find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

Using the equation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we know that \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator. We expand \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute this into the expression:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2.
\]

Again, using the equation \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\), we substitute this into the expression:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
