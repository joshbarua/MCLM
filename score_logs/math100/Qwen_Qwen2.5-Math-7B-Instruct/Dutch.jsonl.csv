"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) radians is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify each part of the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Simplify the expression further:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k}
\]

For \(T_k\) to be a constant term, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3} x^{15-5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3} x^0
\]

Since \(x^0 = 1\), the term simplifies to:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 (-1) \frac{1}{8}
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute the binomial coefficient back into the expression:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -1000 \times \frac{1}{8}

\[
T_3 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 7 \cdot 3 + 3\text{)}

"To determine the minimal number of degrees that a regular pentagon must be rotated about its center to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is:

\[
\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
\]

However, we are interested in the angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position. A full rotation is \(360^\circ\), and since the pentagon has five sides, it will return to its original position after rotating by an angle that is a fraction of \(360^\circ\) corresponding to the number of sides. Specifically, the minimal angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Thus, the minimal number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). This means that the point \( D(6, -1) \) is not the correct fourth vertex. Instead, we need to consider the possibility that \( D \) is such that \( B \) and \( C \) are the midpoints of the diagonals.

Let's assume \( B \) is the midpoint of \( AC \) and \( C \) is the midpoint of \( BD \). This would mean:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (7, 4)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 4
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 7 \implies 6+x = 14 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 4 \implies 8+y = 8 \implies y = 0
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \( D \) are \( (8, 0) \). Therefore, the value of \( x + y \) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 0 = 8

Given the equation \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) in my head, I can use the fact that \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten as \((99 + 1)^2\). Let's see why this is true:

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), then

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by examining the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   For \(18_9\):

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given. Let's define the variables as follows:
- \( t \) is the weight of one treek.
- \( s \) is the weight of one squig.
- \( g \) is the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Tien treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10t = 3s + g
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh as much as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

We need to find the value of \( t \) in terms of \( s \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
10t = 4s - 2t
\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides to combine like terms:
\[
12t = 4s
\]
Divide both sides by 12 to solve for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{4s}{12} = \frac{s}{3}

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius of the tank.

First, let's denote the radius of the tank by \(r\) meters and the height of the tank by \(h\) meters. The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]

Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]

The rate at which the water level rises is given as 4 meters per hour. This can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4
\]

We need to find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume \(\frac{dV}{dt}\) and the rate of change of the height \(\frac{dh}{dt}\). Using the chain rule, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt} (\pi r^2 h)
\]

Since the radius \(r\) is constant, we can treat \(r^2\) as a constant. Therefore, the differentiation becomes:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substituting the given values \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) into the equation, we get:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

To solve for \(r^2\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):
\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). Therefore, for \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, for \(x < a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) if \(a < 0\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the intervals \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) (if \(a > 0\)) or \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) and \((a^3, \infty)\) (if \(a < 0\)) must cover all real numbers. This means that the two intervals must overlap or be adjacent.

- If \(a > 0\), the intervals are \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For these intervals to cover all real numbers, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\). Rearranging the inequality, we get \(a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\), or \(a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\). Factoring the quadratic expression, we get \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\). The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \([2, \infty)\). Testing a value in each interval, we find that \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) for \(a \in (0, 2]\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) in this case is \(a = 2\).

- If \(a < 0\), the intervals are \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) and \([a^3, \infty)\). For these intervals to cover all real numbers, we need \(a^2 + 2a \geq a^3\). Rearranging the inequality, we get \(a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\), or \(a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\). Factoring the quadratic expression, we get \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\). The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([-1, 0)\). Testing a value in each interval, we find that \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) for \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) in this case is \(a = -1\).

Comparing the two cases, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation that are not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

To do this, we substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation and verify that it satisfies the equation:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda - 1 \neq 0\) (otherwise \(x = 0\)), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1} = 0.
\]
Simplifying the last term, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda - \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 2\lambda - \lambda - \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
3\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 3\), \(b = -5\), and \(c = 1\), we get:
\[
\lambda = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{25 - 12}}{6} = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{13}}{6}.
\]
Since \(0 \le \lambda \le 4\), we have:
\[
\lambda = \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6} \quad \text{and} \quad \lambda = \frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{6}.
\]
We need to check if these values of \(\lambda\) give us a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). For \(\lambda = \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6}\), we have:
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = f\left(\frac{\frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6} - 1}{\frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6}}\right) = f\left(\frac{\frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{6}}{\frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6}}\right) = f\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{5 + \sqrt{13}}\right).
\]
Rationalizing the denominator, we get:
\[
f\left(\frac{-1 + \sqrt{13}}{5 + \sqrt{13}} \cdot \frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{5 - \sqrt{13}}\right) = f\left(\frac{-5 + \sqrt{13} + 5\sqrt{13} - 13}{25 - 13}\right) = f\left(\frac{-18 + 6\sqrt{13}}{12}\right) = f\left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\right).
\]
Since \(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2} \in [0,1]\) and \(f\left(\frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\right) \neq \frac{-3 + \sqrt{13}}{2}\), \(\lambda = \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6}\) is a valid solution. Similarly, we can check that \(\lambda = \frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{6}\) is also a valid solution.

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,

\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We need to find a common angle that simplifies this expression. Notice that:

\[
\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[

\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{3!}
\]

Next, we calculate \( 7! \) and \( 3! \):

\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

\[
\frac{5040}{6} = 840
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y)
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_x = \frac{(1 - y^2) - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Similarly, for the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule again:

\[
f_y = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Simplifying the first term:

\[
f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_y = \frac{-xy + (1 - x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{1 - x^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]

To find the critical points, we set both partial derivatives to zero:

\[
f_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f_y = 0
\]

This gives us the system of equations:

\[
\frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - x^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]

Simplifying these equations:

\[
1 - y^2 - xy = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 - x^2 - xy = 0
\]

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[
(1 - y^2 - xy) - (1 - x^2 - xy) = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]

Factoring the difference of squares:

\[
(x - y)(x + y) = 0
\]

Thus, we have two cases:

1. \( x = y \)
2. \( x = -y \)

**Case 1: \( x = y \)**

Substitute \( x = y \) into the function \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \):

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2x) \right)
\]

Simplifying the derivative:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]

Setting the derivative to zero:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into \( f(x, x) \):

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1
\]

**Case 2: \( x = -y \)**

Substitute \( x = -y \) into the function \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x, -x) = x \sqrt{1 - (-x)^2} + (-x) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0
\]

Thus, \( f(x, -x) = 0 \) for all \( x \).

** boundary points:**

We also need to check the boundary points where \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \):

- If \( x = 1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2}
  \]
  The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 1 when \( y = 0 \).

- If \( x = -1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}
  \]
  The minimum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is -1 when \( y = 0 \).

- If \( y = 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
  \]
  The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1 when \( x = 0 \).

- If \( y = -1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}
  \]
  The minimum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is -1 when \( x = 0 \).

From all these cases, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

\[

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

"To solve for the area of triangle \( \triangle ENG \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Since \( MN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and passes through the centroid \( G \), \( \triangle AMN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangle to the distances from the vertices to the sides of the triangle. This ratio is \( \frac{2}{3} \) because the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1.

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of \( \triangle AMN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

This ratio is \( \frac{1}{3} \) because \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, and \( E \) is the midpoint of \( AC \), so \( EG \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of \( EC \).

The fraction is \(\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}\). To convert this fraction into a decimal, we need to express it with a denominator that is a power of 10. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to make the denominator \(2^7 \cdot 5^7 = 10^7\).

This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

There are 7 divisors in this list. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many stuivers Hillary has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the value of each type of coin.
2. Calculate the total value of the dimes.
3. Subtract the value of the dimes from the total value of the coins to find the value of the stuivers.
4. Determine the number of stuivers based on their value.

Let's start with the value of each type of coin:
- A dime is worth 10 cents.
- A stuiver is worth 5 cents.

 Hillary has 10 dimes. Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
\[ 10 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents per dime} = 100 \text{ cents} \]

However, we are given that the total value of all the coins is 75 cents. This seems incorrect based on the initial problem statement. Let's re-eide the problem statement to ensure it is correct.

Given the problem statement again:
 Hillary has 10 dimes, all double-counted and stuivers. In total are the coins 75 cents.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both Paul and Jesse to choose an even number.

For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) ways for both Paul and Jesse to choose an odd number.

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[
1 + 25 = 26
\]

The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}
\]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the get numbers they kiezen is even is:

" om finden de waarde van \( b \) wanneer \( a = 4 \) bij de lineaire Vergelijking \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation. Since \( a \) corresponds to \( x \) in the equation, we replace \( x \) with 4.
   \[
   3(4) + 2y = 12
   \]

2. Perform the multiplication.
   \[
   12 + 2y = 12
   \]

3. Isolate the term involving \( y \) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation.
   \[
   2y = 12 - 12
   \]
   \[
   2y = 0
   \]

4. Solve for \( y \) by dividing both sides by 2.
   \[
   y = \frac{0}{2}
   \]
   \[
   y = 0

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and the properties of the squares and the diagonals.

1. **Identify the side length of each square:**
   Each square has a side length of 1 unit.

2. **Determine the coordinates of the points where the diagonals intersect:**
   - The diagonal from \((0, 4)\) to \((3, 0)\) can be described by the equation \(y = -\frac{4}{3}x + 4\).
   - The diagonal from \((0, 4)\) to \((2, 0)\) can be described by the equation \(y = -2x + 4\).

3. **Find the intersection point of the two diagonals:**
   Set the equations equal to each other to find the x-coordinate of the intersection:
   \[
   -\frac{4}{3}x + 4 = -2x + 4
   \]
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   -\frac{4}{3}x + 2x = 0
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \left(2 - \frac{4}{3}\right)x = 0
   \]
   \[
   \left(\frac{6}{3} - \frac{4}{3}\right)x = 0
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2}{3}x = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 0
   \]
   Substitute \(x = 0\) back into either equation to find the y-coordinate:
   \[
   y = -2(0) + 4 = 4

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it cannot contain the digit 2 or 5. Therefore, the number must be composed of the digit 1 repeated a certain number of times to satisfy the factors of 3 and 2, and it must end in 00 to satisfy the factors of 5.

First, let's consider the factor of 5. The number must end in 00. Next, let's consider the factor of 2. Since the number ends in 00, it already satisfies the factor of 2.

Now, we need to find the smallest number composed of 1s and 0s that ends in 00 and has at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Let's start with the smallest possible number that ends in 00 and see if it satisfies the condition.

1. **100**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 0 + 0 = 1\), which is not divisible by 3.
2. **1100**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3.
3. **11100**: The sum of the digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.

The number 11100 satisfies all the conditions: it ends in 00 and the sum of its digits is 3, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 11100 is the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all the digits are either 0 or 1.

The answer is:

"To determine the probability that the damsteen is placed on an empty square of the dambord, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of squares on the dambord:**
   The dambord is a 4x5 grid, so it has \(4 \times 5 = 20\) squares.

2. **Determine the number of squares that will be occupied:**
   - The first number is divided by 4, and the remainder will be one of the numbers 1, 2, 3. This means that the first number can be any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, but only the remainders 1, 2, or 3 will result in a square being occupied in the first column.
   - The second number is divided by 5, and the remainder will be one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. This means that the second number can be any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or 20, but only the remainders 1, 2, 3, or 4 will result in a square being occupied in the second row.
   - Therefore, there are 3 possible choices for the first number (which will result in a square being occupied in the first column) and 4 possible choices for the second number (which will result in a square being occupied in the second row). This gives us \(3 \times 4 = 12\) possible combinations of remainders, and thus 12 squares will be occupied.

3. **Calculate the number of empty squares:**
   Since there are 20 squares in total and 12 of them are occupied, the number of empty squares is \(20 - 12 = 8\).

4. **Determine the probability that the damsteen is placed on an empty square:**
   The probability is the number of empty squares divided by the total number of squares, which is \(\frac{8}{20} = \frac{2}{5}\).

Therefore, the probability that the damsteen is placed on an empty square of the dambord is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}\).","[2/5, '\\frac{2}{5}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of specific angles, which gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis,
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane,
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\). This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(c\) in the \(z\)-direction.

"To find the smallest possible angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes of \(\mathbf{a}\), \(\mathbf{b}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the sum of the roots of the original function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \).

For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by the formula:
\[
-\frac{a_2}{a_3}
\]
In the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficients are \( a_3 = 1 \), \( a_2 = -49 \), \( a_1 = 623 \), and \( a_0 = -2015 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \), which means \( f(x + 5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( f(x) \), then \( x + 5 = r \) implies \( x = r - 5 \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5 \), \( r_2 - 5 \), and \( r_3 - 5 \), where \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = (r_1 + r_2 + r_3) - 15

Since the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is 49, we substitute this value into the equation:

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\]

We use the identity \(\tan^2 x + \cot^2 x = \tan^2 x + \frac{1}{\tan^2 x} = \frac{\tan^4 x + 1}{\tan^2 x}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{\tan^4 20^\circ + 1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the missing interior angle. Therefore, the total sum of all interior angles is:
   \[

3. **Relate the total sum to the formula:**
   According to the formula, the total sum of the interior angles is also:
   \[

4. **Set up the equation:**
   Equate the two expressions for the total sum:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We need to find \(A\) such that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the lower bound:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2

   Simplify:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

   Next, solve the upper bound:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}

   Simplify:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444

   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444

   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. This means that:

\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. This means we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[

\[

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two potential solutions for \( t \):

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4
\]
\[
t = -1 - 5 = -6
\]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = -6 \). To express \( -6 \) as a positive integer modulo 23, we add 23:

\[

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

\[
323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1

a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2
\]

First, calculate \(2003 - 1\):
\[
2003 - 1 = 2002
\]

Next, multiply 2002 by 2:
\[
2002 \cdot 2 = 4004
\]

Finally, add 1 to 4004:
\[
1 + 4004 = 4005

"To find the value of \( g(f(5)-1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

Next, we subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \):
\[

Now, we need to evaluate \( g \) at 6. The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.

However, we know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\). Therefore, the equation \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is a contradiction. This means there are no real values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula for the distance between a point on one line and the plane containing the other line. Specifically, if we have a point \(\mathbf{a}\) on the first line and a point \(\mathbf{b}\) on the second line, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines, the distance \(D\) is given by

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|}.
\]

Here, we can choose \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we compute the vector \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-2) - (-5)(-9)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-2) - (-5)(2)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-9) - (-7)(2)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{i}(14 - 45) - \mathbf{j}(-16 + 10) + \mathbf{k}(-72 + 14) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we compute the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, the distance \(D\) between the two lines is:

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates lie strictly within the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This gives us the integer values for \(x\) as:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[

\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

and

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[

"To determine the average price of Juan's 1970s postzegels, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of postzegels for each country in the 1970s.
2. Calculate the total cost of the postzegels for each country in the 1970s.
3. Sum the total costs for all countries.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of postzegels to find the average price.

Let's start with the first step:

**Step 1: Identify the number of postzegels for each country in the 1970s.**

From the table, we can see:
- Brazil: 12 postzegels
- Frank里: 15 postzegels
- Peru: 6 postzegels
- Spain: 13 postzegels

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the postzegels for each country in the 1970s.**

- Brazil: \(12 \text{ postzegels} \times 6 \text{ cent per postzegel} = 72 \text{ cents}\)
- Frank里: \(15 \text{ postzegels} \times 4 \text{ cent per postzegel} = 60 \text{ cents}\)
- Peru: \(6 \text{ postzegels} \times 4 \text{ cent per postzegel} = 24 \text{ cents}\)
- Spain: \(13 \text{ postzegels} \times 5 \text{ cent per postzegel} = 65 \text{ cents}\)

**Step 3: Sum the total costs for all countries.**

\[
72 \text{ cents} + 60 \text{ cents} + 24 \text{ cents} + 65 \text{ cents} = 221 \text{ cents}

**Step 4: Divide the total cost by the total number of postzegels to find the average price.**

The total number of postzegels in the 1970s is:
\[

\]

The average price is:
\[
\frac{221 \text{ cents}}{46} \approx 4.804347826

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezium with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezium is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezium can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezium \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Let \([\triangle ACD] = x\) and \([\triangle ABC] = y\). Then we have:
\[
x + y = 42 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x}{y} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we know:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{\frac{ab}{c}}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

We also know from the area of the trapezium:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]
Since \(AB = \frac{ab}{c}\), we can substitute \(AB\) in the area formula:
\[
\left(a + \frac{ab}{c}\right) \times c = 84 \implies ac + ab = 84 \implies a(c + b) = 84
\]

Now, we need to find the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\). From the area ratio:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
We can express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(c\):
\[
b = \frac{c \times y}{x}
\]

Substitute \(b\) into the equation \(a(c + b) = 84\):
\[
a\left(c + \frac{c \times y}{x}\right) = 84 \implies a \left(\frac{cx + cy}{x}\right) = 84 \implies a \left(\frac{c(x + y)}{x}\right) = 84
\]
Since \(x + y = 42\):
\[
a \left(\frac{c \times 42}{x}\right) = 84 \implies a \times \frac{42c}{x} = 84 \implies a \times \frac{c}{x} = 2 \implies a = \frac{2x}{c}
\]

Substitute \(a = \frac{2x}{c}\) into the area ratio:
\[
\frac{\frac{2x}{c}}{b} = \frac{b}{c} \implies \frac{2x}{bc} = \frac{b}{c} \implies 2x = b^2
\]

We also know:
\[
a + b = \frac{2x}{c} + b = \frac{2x + bc}{c}
\]
From \(a(c + b) = 84\):
\[
\left(\frac{2x}{c} + b\right) \times c = 84 \implies 2x + bc = 84
\]
Since \(b^2 = 2x\):
\[
2x + b^2 = 84 \implies 2x + 2x = 84 \implies 4x = 84 \implies x = 21

\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9

First, we calculate the product of \( m \) and \( p \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factor of 10 in the numerator and the denominator:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we traverse the circle in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, the points must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on the circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining 3 points. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must alternate. There are 2 possible alternating arrangements: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the gear circled region.

\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

The total area of the gear circled region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the gear circled region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The gear circled region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points where the circles intersect.

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta

Therefore, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:

The area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points where the circles intersect.

The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) (in radians) is:

The area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord is:

Therefore, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:

2\theta - 2 \sin \theta = 2(\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

The total area of the gear circled region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + 2(\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + \frac{4(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2}
\]

We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Dividing both sides by 5, we get:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:

We need to find the value of \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution because:
\[
\sin \left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \sin \left(\pi - \frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \sin \left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

However, we need to check if this value satisfies the equation. The correct value is \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is not correct. The correct value is \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \).

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the beaker and the tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker:
\[
\text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[ 20 \text{ feet per minute} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 240 \text{ inches per minute} \]

Next, we know that there are 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the speed in inches per second is:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommission of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommission must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommission of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommission that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommission consisting only of Republicans or only of Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommission of 5 members from the 14 committee members. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommission consisting only of Republicans. There are 8 Republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommission consisting only of Democrats. There are 6 Democrats, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommission consisting only of Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommission consisting only of Democrats from the total number of ways to form a subcommission of 5 members:

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommission of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[
(513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120:
\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

Next, we are given that the product divided by the average of the three integers is 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product divided by the average is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24
\]

We recognize that \((n-1) \cdot (n+1)\) is a difference of squares:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:
\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5

We need to determine the three consecutive integers for both values of \( n \).

1. If \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   n-1 = 4, \quad n = 5, \quad n+1 = 6
   \]
   The product is:
   \[
   4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120

   The average is:
   \[
   \frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = 5

   The product divided by the average is:
   \[
   \frac{120}{5} = 24

   This satisfies the given condition.

2. If \( n = -5 \):
   \[
   n-1 = -6, \quad n = -5, \quad n+1 = -4

   \[
   (-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Thus, the expression becomes:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\), so:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
Since \(BC = 2BM = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2}\), we substitute \(BC\) into the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and the properties of the triangle. By symmetry and trigonometric identities, we find that \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{2 \cdot 11 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + 333} = \sqrt{454} = 11\sqrt{3}

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\). So, this part of the inequality does not restrict the values of \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which is equivalent to:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

or

which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the number of male busreizigers closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female busreizigers, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the percentage of female busreizigers for each class and then compare it to the percentage of male busreizigers.

First, let's convert \(135\%\) to a decimal:
\[ 135\% = 1.35 \]

Now, we will calculate \(1.35\) times the percentage of female busreizigers for each class and compare it to the percentage of male busreizigers.

1. **9th class:**
   - Percentage of female busreizigers: \(39.4\%\)
   - \(1.35 \times 39.4\% = 1.35 \times 0.394 = 0.5329\)
   - Percentage of male busreizigers: \(41.1\%\)
   - Difference: \(41.1\% - 0.5329 \times 100\% = 41.1\% - 53.29\% = -12.19\%\)

2. **10th class:**
   - Percentage of female busreizigers: \(33.1\%\)
   - \(1.35 \times 33.1\% = 1.35 \times 0.331 = 0.44685\)
   - Percentage of male busreizigers: \(34.4\%\)
   - Difference: \(34.4\% - 0.44685 \times 100\% = 34.4\% - 44.685\% = -10.285\%\)

3. **11th class:**
   - Percentage of female busreizigers: \(13.8\%\)
   - \(1.35 \times 13.8\% = 1.35 \times 0.138 = 0.1863\)
   - Percentage of male busreizigers: \(20.6\%\)
   - Difference: \(20.6\% - 0.1863 \times 100\% = 20.6\% - 18.63\% = 1.97\%\)

4. **12th class:**
   - Percentage of female busreizigers: \(8.6\%\)
   - \(1.35 \times 8.6\% = 1.35 \times 0.086 = 0.1161\)
   - Percentage of male busreizigers: \(11.6\%\)
   - Difference: \(11.6\% - 0.1161 \times 100\% = 11.6\% - 11.61\% = -0.01\%\)

Now, we compare the absolute values of the differences:
- 9th class: \(|-12.19\%| = 12.19\%\)
- 10th class: \(|-10.285\%| = 10.285\%\)
- 11th class: \(|1.97\%| = 1.97\%\)
- 12th class: \(|-0.01\%| = 0.01\%\)

The smallest difference is \(0.01\%\), which corresponds to the 12th class.

Therefore, the class with the number of male busreizigers closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female busreizigers is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:
\[
(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).
\]

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the variables. Let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) and the width be \( W \). The track consists of two straight lengths of the rectangle and two half-circles, each with a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the track is given as 400 meters. Therefore, we can write the equation for the perimeter of the track as:
\[
2L + 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = 400
\]
Simplifying the equation, we get:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we have:
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right)W
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we find:
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
L = 200 - 100 = 100
\]

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since side lengths are positive), we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is also defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the square root of the fraction:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \]
Factoring out \( x \):
\[ x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0 \]
This gives us one solution \( x = 0 \), but since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a valid solution. We need to solve the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \]
Factoring the quadratic equation:
\[ (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0 \]
This gives us two solutions \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \), but since \( x > 3 \), neither of these solutions is valid. Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) when \( x > 3 \).

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
Rearranging the equation:
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. Since \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \), it is not a valid solution. We need to check if there are any other real roots. However, since we already found a valid root in the interval \( x \leq 3 \), we do not need to check further.

So, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) and the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

First, we place the octahedron in a coordinate system such that:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

The distances from \( P \) to these vertices are given by the Euclidean distance formula:

d(P, A) = 3, \quad d(P, B) = 7, \quad d(P, C) = 8, \quad d(P, D) = 9, \quad d(P, E) = 11

We need to find \( d(P, F) \).

First, square each given distance:

\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64

\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81

\]
\[
-2y + 20 = 55
\]
\[
-2y = 35

\[
y = -\frac{35}{2}

(x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2) - (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 81 - 9
\]
\[
2y + 2x = 72

\[
2y + 2(10) = 72
\]
\[
2y + 20 = 72
\]
\[
2y = 52

\[
y = 26

Subtract the first equation from the fifth:
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 121 - 9
\]
\[
-2z + 2x = 112
\]
\[
-2z + 2(10) = 112
\]
\[
-2z + 20 = 112
\]
\[
-2z = 92
\]
\[
z = -46

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the softball with the same force as Jack throws the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball:
- The mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} \), is 200 g.
- The mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} \), is 150 g.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1556_7
\]

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

There are 3 common digits: \(1, 5, 6\).

Thus, the number of same digits found in the base 7 and base 8 representaties of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the total number of handshakes at the meeting, we need to consider the handshakes between the heks and the handshakes between the tovenaars.

1. **Handshakes between the heks:**
   - There are 10 heks.
   - Each heken shakes hands with every other heken exactly once.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 heks out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of heks.

   - Therefore, there are 45 handshakes among the heks.

2. **Handshakes between the tovenaars:**
   - There are 10 tovenaars.
   - Each tovenar shakes hands with every other tovenar exactly once.
   - The number of ways to choose 2 tovenaars out of 10 to shake hands is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \), where \( n \) is the number of tovenaars.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:

\[

\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Now, we need to find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2\), \(t = 1 + i\), and \(t = 1 - i\).

"To determine the cost of one potlode in cents, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one potlode in dollars.
- Let \( g \) be the cost of one jumbo gum in dollars.

We are given two equations based on the information provided:
1. Drie potlods and one jumbo gum cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3p + g = 1.24
   \]
2. Vijf potlods and one jumbo gum cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + g = 1.82

To eliminate \( g \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + g) - (3p + g) = 1.82 - 1.24

Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[

The cost of one potlode is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need \(d(P, O) < d(P, A)\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we need \(d(P, O) < d(P, B)\), \(d(P, O) < d(P, C)\), and \(d(P, O) < d(P, D)\). These inequalities are:
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Combining these inequalities, we get the region where \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex:
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < -ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < -ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\right) \left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}
\]

Given \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a/b = k\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4(kb)^2} = \frac{k^2b^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4k^2b^2} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6

Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:

3n - 6 = 2n + 1

Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[

(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The sum of the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Jim loops than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim covers. Jim loops diagonally over the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Here, the length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. So, the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Jim loops 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha covers. Martha loops along the length and the width of the field. The total distance she covers is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Distance} = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]
So, Martha loops 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference in the distances they cover:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Jim loops 200 feet less than Martha. The answer is:
\[
\boxed{200}

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real root.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be covered by visiting all four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) exactly once, we need to consider all possible permutations of these points and calculate the total distance for each permutation. The shortest distance among these permutations will be the answer.

Let's denote the distances between the points as follows:
- \(d(A, B)\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(B\),
- \(d(A, C)\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(C\),
- \(d(A, D)\) is the distance between points \(A\) and \(D\),
- \(d(B, C)\) is the distance between points \(B\) and \(C\),
- \(d(B, D)\) is the distance between points \(B\) and \(D\),
- \(d(C, D)\) is the distance between points \(C\) and \(D\).

We need to calculate the total distance for each permutation of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\). There are \(4! = 24\) permutations, but we can use symmetry and the triangle inequality to simplify our calculations.

Let's consider the permutation \(A \to B \to C \to D\). The total distance for this permutation is:
\[d(A, B) + d(B, C) + d(C, D).\]

Now, let's consider the permutation \(A \to B \to D \to C\). The total distance for this permutation is:
\[d(A, B) + d(B, D) + d(D, C).\]

We can see that the distance \(d(A, B)\) is common in both permutations. To find the shortest distance, we need to compare \(d(B, C) + d(C, D)\) and \(d(B, D) + d(D, C)\). By the triangle inequality, we know that:
\[d(B, C) + d(C, D) \geq d(B, D),\]
and
\[d(B, D) + d(D, C) \geq d(B, C).\]

Therefore, the shortest distance among these two permutations is:
\[d(A, B) + d(B, D) + d(D, C).\]

We can apply the same logic to the other permutations. The shortest distance will always be the sum of the distances of the shortest paths between the points. Thus, the shortest distance that can be covered by visiting all four points exactly once is:
\[\boxed{d(A, B) + d(B, D) + d(D, C)}.\]","[d(A, B) + d(B, D) + d(D, C), 'd(A, B) + d(B, D) + d(D, C)']",13,"[13, '13']",False
