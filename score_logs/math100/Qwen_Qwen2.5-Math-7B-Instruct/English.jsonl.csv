"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counter-clockwise is equivalent to multiplying it by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of the rotation is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion where the power of \(x\) is zero (the constant term).

The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

First, simplify each part of the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} (x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k (x^{-2})^k = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combine these results:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Simplify the expression further:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-3k-2k}
\]

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} 10^{5-k} (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{15-5k}
\]

For \(T_k\) to be a constant term, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solve for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3
\]

Now, substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^{5-3} (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3} x^{15-5(3)}
\]

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 10^2 (-1)^3 \frac{1}{2^3} x^0
\]

Since \(x^0 = 1\), the term simplifies to:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} 100 (-1) \frac{1}{8}
\]

Calculate the binomial coefficient:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{3! \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

Substitute the binomial coefficient back into the expression:

\[
T_3 = 10 \times 100 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = 1000 \times (-1) \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -1000 \times \frac{1}{8}
\]

\[
T_3 = -125

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) is:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we reduce each number modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad 6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, we reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{so} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise about its center until it coincides with its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions where the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated. The angle of rotation for each symmetry position is given by dividing 360 degrees (a full rotation) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated counterclockwise until it coincides with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's consider another pair of diagonals.

Let's try the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

 again, \( x = 4 \) is not valid. Let's try another pair of diagonals.

Let's try the diagonals \( AD \) and \( BC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AD = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

\[
\text{Midpoint of } BC = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right) = (6.5, 6)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = (6.5, 6)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = 6.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = 6.5 \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \( D \) are \( (8, 9) \). Therefore, the value of \( x + y \) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To determine the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to find the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, as these values will make the function undefined. The denominator of the function is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \). We can factor this quadratic expression as follows:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us:

\[
(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0
\]

This equation has solutions \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, we have \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to determine the horizontal asymptote of the function. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator of \( f(x) \) is \( 2x \), which is a linear polynomial (degree 1), and the denominator is \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \), which is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, we have \( c = 0 \).

Now, we need to find the sum \( a + b + c \):

a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \). We take the derivative of \( g(t) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points:
\[
g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]
Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we get
\[
-12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]
This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \). We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these critical points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):
\[
g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,
\]
\[
g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,
\]
\[
\lim_{t \to \pm \infty} g(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4.
\]
The maximum value of \( g(t) \) is 16, so the maximum value of \( f(t) = \sqrt{g(t)} \) is \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \). Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) for which the inequality holds is

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by examining the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to compute \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.

"To compute \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\):**

   - For \(58_9\):
     \[
     58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   - For \(18_9\):

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To determine how many treeks weigh the same as one squig, we start by defining the weights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one goolee.

We are given two equations based on the problem statement:
1. Ten treeks weigh as much as three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10t = 3s + g
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

First, we solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, we substitute \( g = s - 2t \) into the first equation:
\[
10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
10t = 3s + s - 2t
\]
\[
10t = 4s - 2t
\]

Add \( 2t \) to both sides to isolate terms involving \( t \) on one side:
\[
12t = 4s
\]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( s \) in terms of \( t \):
\[
s = 3t

Thus, the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of three treeks. Therefore, the combined weight of \(\boxed{3}\) treeks equals the weight of one squig.","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of \(3t^2+5t+a\) and \(4t^2+bt-2\) equals \(12t^4+26t^3-8t^2-16t+6\), we start by expanding the left-hand side of the equation.

The expansion of \((3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2)\) is given by:
\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 3t^2(4t^2+bt-2) + 5t(4t^2+bt-2) + a(4t^2+bt-2)
\]
We now distribute each term:
\[
3t^2(4t^2+bt-2) = 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2
\]
\[
5t(4t^2+bt-2) = 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t
\]
\[
a(4t^2+bt-2) = 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]
Adding these together, we get:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a = 12t^4 + (3b+20)t^3 + (-6+5b+4a)t^2 + (-10+ab)t - 2a
\]
We know this must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
\[
-2a = 6
\]
We solve these equations one by one. From the last equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]
Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the third equation:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]
Now we substitute \(b = 2\) into the first equation to verify:
\[
3(2) + 20 = 6 + 20 = 26
\]
This is correct. Finally, we substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the second equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is also correct. Therefore, the values of \(a\) and \(b\) are \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), and the sum \(a + b\) is:
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. In this problem, the volume of water in the tank is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

We can use the chain rule to relate the rates of change of volume and height. The chain rule states that:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since the volume \( V \) of the cylinder is \( \pi r^2 h \), the derivative of \( V \) with respect to \( h \) is:

\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). Therefore, for \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, for \(x < a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) if \(a < 0\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the intervals \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) (if \(a > 0\)) or \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) and \([a^3, \infty)\) (if \(a < 0\)) must cover all real numbers. This means that the two intervals must overlap or be adjacent.

- If \(a > 0\), the intervals are \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\). For these intervals to cover all real numbers, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\). Rearranging the inequality, we get \(a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\), or \(a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\). Factoring the quadratic expression, we get \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\). The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \([2, \infty)\). Testing a value in each interval, we find that \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) for \(a \in (0, 2]\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) in this case is \(a = 2\).

- If \(a < 0\), the intervals are \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) and \([a^3, \infty)\). For these intervals to cover all real numbers, we need \(a^2 + 2a \geq a^3\).

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([-1, 0)\). Testing a value in each interval, we find that \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) for \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) in this case is \(a = -1\).

Comparing the two cases, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms separately.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the radius \( r \) is given by \( r^2 = 34 - c \). We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.

This gives us two solutions:
\[

For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

Since we are looking for \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), we discard \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) (which is a fixed point). Therefore, we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this cubic equation has a solution \(x\) in the interval \([0,1]\) such that \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). By inspection, we can test specific values of \(\lambda\).

For \(\lambda = 2\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
Then,
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.
\]
We need to solve:
\[
4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x \implies -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or \(x\) is a root of the cubic polynomial \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots. Testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\), we get:
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. Since \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point, not a periodic point of period 2. However, we can check other values of \(\lambda\) to find that \(\lambda = 3\) works. For \(\lambda = 3\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 3x(1 - x) = 3x - 3x^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(3x - 3x^2) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(1 - (3x - 3x^2)) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) = 3(3x - 9x^2 + 9x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x^3 - 9x^4) = 3(3x - 12x^2 + 18x^3 - 9x^4) = 9x - 36x^2 + 54x^3 - 27x^4.
\]
We need to solve:
\[
9x - 36x^2 + 54x^3 - 27x^4 = x \implies -27x^4 + 54x^3 - 36x^2 + 8x = 0 \implies x(-27x^3 + 54x^2 - 36x + 8) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or \(x\) is a root of the cubic polynomial \(-27x^3 + 54x^2 - 36x + 8 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots. Testing \(x = \frac{2}{3}\), we get:

"To find the degree measure of the least positive angle \(\theta\) for which

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]

Using the angle subtraction formulas \(\cos(45^\circ - x) = \cos 45^\circ \cos x + \sin 45^\circ \sin x\) and \(\sin(45^\circ - x) = \sin 45^\circ \cos x - \cos 45^\circ \sin x\), we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 20^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 40^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 40^\circ}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 20^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 20^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 40^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 40^\circ}.
\]

Factoring out \(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\) from both the numerator and the denominator, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ - \sin 20^\circ - \cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ}.
\]

This expression is quite complex, so we use a different approach. Notice that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 45^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 40^\circ}{\sin 45^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ - \sin 45^\circ \sin 40^\circ}.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider the fact that some of the letters are repeated. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \) (for each of the letters ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"")

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeroes in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we need to count the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in \(42!\). However, there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, so we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate:
\[

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) on the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, we consider the case where both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-zero. We can use trigonometric substitution to simplify the expression. Let \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \cos \phi \) where \( 0 \le \theta, \phi \le \pi \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \cos \phi) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \phi} + \cos \phi \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \sin \phi + \cos \phi \sin \theta. \]
Using the angle addition formula for sine, we have:
\[ \cos \theta \sin \phi + \cos \phi \sin \theta = \sin(\theta + \phi). \]
The maximum value of \( \sin(\theta + \phi) \) is 1, which occurs when \( \theta + \phi = \frac{\pi}{2} \). Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1.

To confirm that this maximum value is achievable, we check if there exist values of \( x \) and \( y \) such that \( f(x, y) = 1 \). If \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( \phi = \frac{\pi}{4} \), then \( x = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \) and \( y = \cos \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \). Substituting these values into the function, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

We expand this determinant along the first row:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}

So, the cross product is \(\begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\).

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product:

\[

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \(z = e^{i\theta}\). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\). If \(z = e^{i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \(z = e^{-i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \(z^{85} = -1\). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve for the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \( G \) and the medians of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) are the medians of triangle \( ABC \), and they intersect at \( G \), we know:
- \( AG = \frac{2}{3}AD \)
- \( BG = \frac{2}{3}BE \)
- \( CG = \frac{2}{3}CF \)

The line through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line parallel to the base. Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \).

Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is:

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + n - d - n = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[ 4 + n = 11 \]
\[ n = 11 - 4 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even, we first identify the first six prime numbers. These are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six primes, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both to choose an even number.
For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) ways for both to choose an odd number.

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[
1 + 25 = 26
\]

The probability that the sum of the numbers they choose is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To determine the value of \( b \) when the point \((a, b)\) lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\) and \(a = 4\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(a = 4\) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\). This will give us an equation in terms of \(b\).
2. Solve the resulting equation for \(b\).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[3(4) + 2b = 12\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[12 + 2b = 12\]

Now, we need to isolate \(b\). We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[2b = 12 - 12\]
\[2b = 0\]

Finally, we solve for \(b\) by dividing both sides by 2:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the two shaded triangles in the given rectangle. The rectangle is formed by twelve 1 by 1 squares, so its dimensions are 3 by 4.

The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units. The area \(A_1\) of this triangle is given by the formula for the area of a triangle:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4
\]

The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is also a right triangle with a base of 1 unit (the difference between the x-coordinates of \((3, 4)\) and \((2, 0)\)) and a height of 4 units. The area \(A_2\) of this triangle is:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeroes and ones, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This is because a number ending in 00 is divisible by 100, and thus by \(5^2 = 25\).

Next, we need to ensure that the number is divisible by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. Since the last digit is already 0, this condition is satisfied.

Now, we need to ensure that the number is divisible by \(3^2 = 9\). A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the sum of the digits will be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, we need the number of 1's to be a multiple of 9.

The smallest multiple of 9 is 9 itself. So, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is a number with 9 ones and ends in 00. This number is:

\[ 11111111100 \]

To verify, we check the divisibility:
- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- It is even, so it is divisible by 2.
- The sum of its digits is \(9\), which is divisible by 9.

"To determine the probability that the checker is placed on a shaded square of the checkerboard, we need to analyze the structure of the checkerboard and the outcomes of the wheel spins.

First, let's understand the checkerboard:
- The checkerboard has 3 columns and 4 rows.
- Each square is either shaded or unshaded.

From the diagram, we can see the pattern of the shaded squares:
- The shaded squares are in the first and third columns.
- Each column has 2 shaded squares and 2 unshaded squares.

Next, we calculate the total number of squares on the checkerboard:
\[
3 \text{ columns} \times 4 \text{ rows} = 12 \text{ squares}
\]

Now, we count the number of shaded squares:
- There are 2 shaded squares in each of the 3 columns.
\[
2 \text{ shaded squares/column} \times 3 \text{ columns} = 6 \text{ shaded squares}

The probability of landing on a shaded square is the ratio of the number of shaded squares to the total number of squares:

"To find the sum of the digits in the terminating decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first need to express the fraction in its decimal form. The denominator \(5^7 \cdot 2^8\) can be rewritten as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True

- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that every point \((r, \theta, z)\) that satisfies this equation has the same \(z\)-coordinate, regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the formula for the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the roots of \( g(x) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we have:

\[ g(x) = 0 \implies f(x + 5) = 0. \]

This means that the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( x + 5 \) is a root of \( f(x) \). Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( r_1, r_2, \) and \( r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, \) and \( r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ (r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15. \]

Next, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by:

\[ -\frac{a_2}{a_3}. \]

For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we have \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-49}{1} = 49. \]

Substituting this back into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

\[ r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34. \]

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This transforms the expression into:

\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

Let \(t = \tan 20^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as:

\[
(t - \sqrt{3})(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1) = 0.

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1 = 0\) are:

\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ\) is positive and less than \(\sqrt{3}\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 2} = -(\sqrt{3} + 2)\).

We also know that \(\tan 40^\circ = \tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} - 2)} = \frac{2}{1 + 3 - 2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{2}{4 - 2\sqrt{3}} = \frac{1}{2 - \sqrt{3}} = 2 + \sqrt{3}\). Therefore, \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3}} = 2 - \sqrt{3}\).

Now, we substitute \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = 2 - \sqrt{3}\) into the expression \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\):

\[

Since \(\tan 10^\circ = \cot 80^\circ\) and \(\cot 80^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan^2 10^\circ = \cot^2 80^\circ\). Using the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), we have \(\cot^2 80^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\). Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 10^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\).

We use the identity \(\tan^2 x + \cot^2 x = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x)^2 - 2\sin^2 x \cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - 2\sin^2 x \cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2}\sin^2 2x}{\frac{1}{4}\sin^2 2x} = \frac{4 - 2\sin^2 2x}{\sin^2 2x} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 2x} - 2\).

Since \(\sin 2x = \sin 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ} - 2\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ} - 2 + (-\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 + (2 - \sqrt{3})^2 = \frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ} - 2 + 13 + 13 = \frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + 24\).

Since \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\), we have \(\frac{4}{\sin^2 20^\circ} = \frac{8}{1 - \cos 40^\circ}\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{8}{1 - \cos 40^\circ} + 24\).

\]

Let the measure of the interior angle that is not included in the sum be \(x\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write the equation:

Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x\), we get:

\[

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\). This gives us the inequality:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180

We will solve this inequality in two parts. First, solve \(0 < 180(n-2) - 1070\):

\[

\[
n-2 > \frac{1070}{180}

\[

Expanding and rearranging the congruence, we get:

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get two possible solutions for \( t \):

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we set up the equation:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:
   \[
   s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of one face of the cube:**
   The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   Substituting the side length \( s = 1 \) foot:
   \[
   A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot}

3. **Determine the total surface area of the cube:**
   A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total surface area \( S \) is:
   \[

   Substituting the area of one face \( A = 1 \) square foot:
   \[
   S = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet}

4. **Convert the surface area to square inches:**
   Since there are 12 inches in a foot, there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, we convert 6 square feet to square inches:
   \[
   S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches}

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to determine what the radical conjugate is. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since these vectors are scalar multiples of each other (specifically, \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\)), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found by determining the perpendicular distance from a point on one line to the other line. We can use the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and find the perpendicular distance to the second line.

The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \(\mathbf{a}\) to a line \(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{b} + s\mathbf{c}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\|}{\|\mathbf{c}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-4) - (-5)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-4) - (-5)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-18) - (-7)(4)).

Simplifying the components, we get:

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{c}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{c}\| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-18)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 324 + 16} = \sqrt{356} = 2\sqrt{89}.

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\|}{\|\mathbf{c}\|} = \frac{2\sqrt{4361}}{2\sqrt{89}} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly in the interior of the rectangular region with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points on the boundary are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of the points strictly in the interior must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This gives us the possible integer values for \(x\) as \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 such values.

Similarly, the \(y\)-coordinates of the points on the boundary are \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, the \(y\)-coordinates of the points strictly in the interior must satisfy:

This gives us the possible integer values for \(y\) as \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). There are 7 such values.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\), and any scalar \(k\), we have:

\[

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (k\mathbf{v}) = k(\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v})

Applying these properties, we get:

Next, we distribute each cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})
\]

Substituting these back into our expression, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[

This can be rewritten as:
\[

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) share the same height \(h\) and the base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(a\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h

The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both triangles and it bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying. This gives us:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

Simplifying both sides, we get:

"To determine the probability that segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we can fix one point and arrange the remaining 3 points. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must alternate. There are 2 possible alternating arrangements: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the shaded regions.

The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

According to the problem, the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the total area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two parts: the smaller shaded region (which is a segment of the smaller circle) and the larger shaded region (which is a segment of the larger circle). Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the smaller shaded region is the area of the sector of the smaller circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{360}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

Therefore, the area of the smaller shaded region is:
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{360} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

The area of the larger shaded region is the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the triangle \(ADC\). The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{\theta \pi}{90}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) is the same as before:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

Therefore, the area of the larger shaded region is:
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{90} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the smaller and larger shaded regions:
\[
\left( \frac{\theta \pi}{360} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \right) + \left( \frac{\theta \pi}{90} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta \right) = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{5\theta \pi}{360} - \sin \theta = \frac{\theta \pi}{72} - \sin \theta
\]

We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{72} - \sin \theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we first isolate the term involving \(\theta\):
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{72} = \frac{5\pi}{3} + \sin \theta
\]

Next, we divide both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{72} = \frac{5}{3} + \frac{\sin \theta}{\pi}
\]

Then, we multiply both sides by 72:
\[
\theta = 120 + 24 \frac{\sin \theta}{\pi}
\]

We need to find a value of \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = 120^\circ\) is a solution. To verify, we substitute \(\theta = 120^\circ\) into the equation:
\[
120 = 120 + 24 \frac{\sin 120^\circ}{\pi}
\]

Since \(\sin 120^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), we have:
\[
24 \frac{\sin 120^\circ}{\pi} = 24 \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{\pi} = 12 \frac{\sqrt{3}}{\pi}
\]

However, this term is not needed because it was already cancel out in the equation. Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical beaker:
\[
\text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Therefore, it will take \(\boxed{4}\) cylindrical beakers of water to fill the spherical tank.","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression \((\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2\):
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

\[ 20 \text{ feet per minute} \times 12 \text{ inches per foot} = 240 \text{ inches per minute} \]

Next, we know that there are 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, the speed in inches per second is:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a Senate committee with 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, such that the subcommittee includes at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that do not meet the requirement (i.e., subcommittees with only Republicans or only Democrats).

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of possible subcommittees.**

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 Republicans + 6 Democrats) is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of subcommittees with only Republicans.**

The number of ways to choose 5 Republicans from 8 is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of subcommittees with only Democrats.**

The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of subcommittees with at least one member from each party.**

To find the number of subcommittees with at least one member from each party, we subtract the number of subcommittees with only Republicans and the number of subcommittees with only Democrats from the total number of possible subcommittees:

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party is:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[

Now, we multiply these two results together:

"Let the three consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). The product of these integers is given by:

\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120

The mean of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product of the three consecutive integers divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24

This can be rewritten as:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

We need to check both cases.

**Case 1: \( n = 5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \). The product is:

\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]

The mean is:

\[
\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = 5

The product divided by the mean is:

\[
\frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

This satisfies the given condition. Therefore, the largest of the three consecutive integers is \( 6 \).

**Case 2: \( n = -5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are \( -6, -5, \) and \( -4 \). The product is:

\[
-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120

This does not satisfy the given condition because the product is 120, not -120.

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[

Thus, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\). However, we only need the product of four specific cosines. To proceed, we use the fact that:

\[

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BAC\):
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ACB} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ABC} = \frac{AB}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{AB}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
BC = AB \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = AB \cdot \frac{2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = 2AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
In \(\triangle BDM\), \(BD\) can also be expressed using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \left(AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2}\right)^2 + 1 = A^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 1
\]
Substituting \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = A^2 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 1
\]
Since \(A = 11\), we substitute \(A = 11\) into the equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = 121 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 1
\]
Let \(x = \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\). Then \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - x^2\), and the equation becomes:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4x^2 + 6x - 4}\right)^2 = 121 (1 - x^2) + 1 = 122 - 121x^2
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{4x^2 + 6x - 4} = \sqrt{122 - 121x^2}
\]
Squaring both sides again, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{(4x^2 + 6x - 4)^2} = 122 - 121x^2
\]
Multiplying both sides by \((4x^2 + 6x - 4)^2\), we get:
\[
1 = (122 - 121x^2)(4x^2 + 6x - 4)
\]
Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
\[
1 = 488x^2 + 732x - 488 - 484x^4 - 726x^3 + 484x^2
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
1 = -484x^4 - 726x^3 + 972x^2 + 732x - 488
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
484x^4 + 726x^3 - 972x^2 - 732x + 489 = 0
\]
By trial and error or using the Rational Root Theorem, we find that \(x = \frac{3}{4}\) is a root. Substituting \(x = \frac{3}{4}\) into the equation, we verify that it satisfies the equation. Therefore, \(\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3}{4}\).

Now, we find \(\sin \frac{\theta}{2}\):
\[
\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{9}{16}} = \sqrt{\frac{7}{16}} = \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4}
\]
Then, \(BC = 2AB \sin \frac{\theta}{2} = 2 \cdot 11 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{7}}{4} = \frac{11\sqrt{7}}{2}\).

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the median of the sequence, which is the 14th term. The 14th term of the sequence is:
\[
a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence can also be expressed as:
\[
27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that the sum of the sequence is \(3^7\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
To isolate \(a + 13\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(3^3\):
\[
a + 13 = \frac{3^7}{3^3} = 3^{7-3} = 3^4 = 81
\]
Thus, the median of the sequence is:
\[
a + 13 = 81
\]
Therefore, the median is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than or equal to 0. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(0 \leq y < 3\), which means \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Thus, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,

so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine which grade has the number of male bus riders closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders for each grade and compare it to the number of male bus riders.

First, let's convert \(135\%\) to a decimal:
\[
135\% = 1.35
\]

Next, we calculate \(1.35\) times the number of female bus riders for each grade.

**9th Grade:**
\[
\text{Female bus riders} = 300 \times 0.394 = 118.2
\]
\[
1.35 \times 118.2 = 158.43
\]
\[
\text{Male bus riders} = 300 \times 0.411 = 123.3
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = |158.43 - 123.3| = 35.13
\]

**10th Grade:**
\[
\text{Female bus riders} = 300 \times 0.331 = 99.3
\]
\[
1.35 \times 99.3 = 133.905
\]
\[
\text{Male bus riders} = 300 \times 0.344 = 103.2
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = |133.905 - 103.2| = 30.705
\]

**11th Grade:**
\[
\text{Female bus riders} = 300 \times 0.138 = 41.4
\]
\[
1.35 \times 41.4 = 55.89
\]
\[
\text{Male bus riders} = 300 \times 0.206 = 61.8
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = |55.89 - 61.8| = 5.91
\]

**12th Grade:**
\[
\text{Female bus riders} = 300 \times 0.086 = 25.8
\]
\[
1.35 \times 25.8 = 35.01
\]
\[
\text{Male bus riders} = 300 \times 0.116 = 34.8
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = |35.01 - 34.8| = 0.21

Now, we compare the differences:
- 9th grade: \(35.13\)
- 10th grade: \(30.705\)
- 11th grade: \(5.91\)
- 12th grade: \(0.21\)

The smallest difference is \(0.21\), which corresponds to the 12th grade.

Therefore, the number of male bus riders is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders in the \(\boxed{12}\)th grade.","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 < 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field enclosed in the track, we start by analyzing the given information. The track consists of two edges of the field and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote:
- \( L \) as the length of the rectangular field.
- \( W \) as the width of the rectangular field.

The track includes:
1. Two straight edges of the field, each of length \( L \).
2. Two semicircles, each with a radius equal to half the width of the field, \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The circumference of one semicircle is given by:
\[
\text{Circumference of one semicircle} = \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

Since there are two semicircles, the total circumference of the semicircles is:
\[
\text{Total circumference of semicircles} = 2 \times \frac{\pi W}{2} = \pi W
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight edges and the total circumference of the semicircles:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) to find the area of the field. Solving for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]

Substituting \( L \) from the equation above:
\[
A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W
\]
\[
200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200

\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}

\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)
\]
\[
L = 200 - 100
\]
\[
L = 100

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}

\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In \(\triangle RST\), the Pythagorean theorem gives:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:

Taking the positive square root of both sides, we get:

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

First, simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the expression for \( D \):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4 \quad \text{and} \quad (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2
\]

Substitute these values back into the function:

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Since \((- \sqrt{2})^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4\) and \((- \sqrt{2})^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\), we have:

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = -2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x. \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3. \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x. \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 0 \) or \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \). Since \( x > 3 \), \( x = 0 \) is not a solution. Solving the quadratic equation \( -x^2 + 2x + 3 = 0 \):
\[ x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0 \implies (x-3)(x+1) = 0. \]
This gives us \( x = 3 \) or \( x = -1 \). Since \( x > 3 \), neither \( x = 3 \) nor \( x = -1 \) is a solution. Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) in the domain \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x. \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3. \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is in the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x. \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0. \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0. \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \), so it is not a solution. We can factor \( -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 \) as \( -(x-2)(x^2 - 4) = -(x-2)(x-2)(x+2) = -(x-2)^2(x+2) \). The only real root in the domain \( x > 3 \) is not present.

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0. \]

The answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve for the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. The vertices can be arranged such that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the edges connecting the vertices of the two pyramids are all equal.

Let the vertices of the octahedron be \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) such that \( A, B, C, D \) form a square in the \( xy \)-plane and \( E \) and \( F \) are the vertices above and below the center of the square, respectively. The coordinates of the vertices can be taken as follows:
- \( A = (1, 1, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 1, 0) \)
- \( C = (-1, -1, 0) \)
- \( D = (1, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

We are given the distances from \( P \) to five of the vertices: 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \).

The distance from \( P \) to each vertex is given by the Euclidean distance formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x - x_i)^2 + (y - y_i)^2 + (z - z_i)^2}
\]

We can write the equations for the distances from \( P \) to \( A, B, C, D, E \) and \( F \):
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2} = d
\]

We need to find \( d \). First, we square each of the given distances to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z + 1)^2 = d^2
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 - ((x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2) = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Similarly, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 - ((x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2) = 64 - 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2 = 55
\]
\[
4x + 4y = 55
\]
\[
x + y = \frac{55}{4}
\]

Since \( x = 10 \), we substitute \( x \) into the equation \( x + y = \frac{55}{4} \):
\[
10 + y = \frac{55}{4}
\]
\[
y = \frac{55}{4} - 10
\]
\[
y = \frac{55}{4} - \frac{40}{4}
\]
\[
y = \frac{15}{4}
\]

Now, we substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( y = \frac{15}{4} \) into the fourth equation:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
(10 - 1)^2 + \left(\frac{15}{4} + 1\right)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
9^2 + \left(\frac{19}{4}\right)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
81 + \frac{361}{16} + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
\frac{361}{16} + z^2 = 0
\]
\[
z^2 = -\frac{361}{16}
\]

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball, we start with the formula for force, which is given by:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Jen wants to throw the softball with the same force as Jack throws the baseball. Therefore, the force exerted by Jen on the softball is equal to the force exerted by Jack on the baseball. We can express this as:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using the force formula for both the softball and the baseball, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We know the mass of the softball is 200 g and the mass of the baseball is 150 g. Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's ball to Jack's ball is:

"To determine how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Counting these, we find there are 3 common digits.

Therefore, the number of the same digits found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

There are 6 witches and 10 sorcerers. Each witch shakes hands with each of the 10 sorcerers. Therefore, the total number of handshakes is calculated by multiplying the number of witches by the number of sorcerers:

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:

\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to compute \( g(1) \):

\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[

\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

Next, we substitute the coordinates of the point \((6, 0)\) into the formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.

Let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\). Then \(a + b = -2\) and:

\[
ab = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]

From the equation \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab + S_3 = 0 \implies S_3 = -ab.
\]

We also know that:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 2.
\]

Let \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = c\) and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\). Then \(cd = 2\). Since \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = c + d\) and \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = ab - S_3 = ab + ab = 2ab\), we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = c + d + 2ab = 0.
\]

Substituting \(d = \frac{2}{c}\) into the equation, we get:

\[
c + \frac{2}{c} + 2ab = 0.
\]

Since \(ab = -\alpha_1\alpha_2 - \alpha_3\alpha_4 = -c - d = -c - \frac{2}{c}\), we substitute \(ab\) into the equation:

\[
c + \frac{2}{c} + 2\left(-c - \frac{2}{c}\right) = 0 \implies c + \frac{2}{c} - 2c - \frac{4}{c} = 0 \implies -c - \frac{2}{c} = 0 \implies c^2 + 2 = 0 \implies c^2 = -2.

"To determine the cost of a pencil, we start by defining the variables for the costs of the pencils and the eraser. Let \( p \) be the cost of one pencil in dollars and \( e \) be the cost of one jumbo eraser in dollars. We can set up the following system of linear equations based on the given information:

1. Three pencils and a jumbo eraser cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3p + e = 1.24
   \]

2. Five pencils and a jumbo eraser cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + e = 1.82
   \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( e \):

\[
(5p + e) - (3p + e) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
5p - 3p = 0.58
\]

\[
2p = 0.58
\]

To find the value of \( p \), we divide both sides by 2:

\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2}
\]

\[
p = 0.29
\]

The cost of one pencil is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[

Therefore, the cost of a pencil is \(\boxed{29}\) cents.","[29, '29']",29,"[29, '29']",True
"To determine the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

137 \div 500 = 0.274

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). To identify the last nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point, we look at the digits in the decimal part: \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\).

Among these digits, the last nonzero digit is \(4\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe a region inside the rectangle where the point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex. This region is a square with side length \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) centered at the origin.

The area of this square is:
\[
(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4ab}
\]

Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb
\]

Substituting \(a = kb\) into the probability expression:
\[
\frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{4(kb)b} = \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{4k b^2} = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{4k b^2} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}

Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the remainder of \(54 \mod 6\), we need to find the integer \(r\) such that \(0 \leq r < 6\) and \(54 = 6q + r\) for some integer \(q\). Here, \(r\) is the remainder when 54 is divided by 6.

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we can express 54 as:
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
Since \(6 \cdot 9 = 54\), we have:
\[54 = 54 + r\]
Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get:
\[r = 0\]
Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie converted as many of the coins into bills as they could, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money earned by all four girls:**

   - Linda earned \$27.47
   - Sherry earned \$35.23
   - June earned \$37.37
   - Connie earned \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. **Add the amounts step by step:**

   First, add Linda's and Sherry's earnings:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]

   Next, add June's earnings to the result:
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]

   Finally, add Connie's earnings to the result:
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total amount of money earned by all four girls is \$126.59.

3. **Convert the total amount into dollars and cents:**

   The total amount \$126.59 consists of:
   - 126 dollars
   - 59 cents

4. **Determine how many coins can be converted into bills:**

   Since each bill is worth at least 1 dollar, the number of bills they can convert is 126.

5. **Calculate the total value of the bills:**

   The total value of 126 bills is:
   \[
   126 \times 1 = 126 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Find the amount of money left after converting the coins into bills:**

   Subtract the total value of the bills from the total amount of money earned:
   \[
   126.59 - 126 = 0.59
   \]

   This means they have 0.59 dollars left, which is equivalent to 59 cents.

"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The first row is:
\[
(7-3) + 3 + (7+1) = 4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]

The second row is:
\[
(7+2) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 1 = 9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]

The third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

The first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The main diagonal is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The other diagonal is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less than Martha Jim walks, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim walks. Jim walks diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that for a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. Here, the width of the field is 300 feet and the length of the field is 400 feet. So, the distance Jim walks is:
\[
\text{Distance Jim walks} = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
300^2 = 90000 \quad \text{and} \quad 400^2 = 160000
\]
Adding these together, we get:
\[
90000 + 160000 = 250000
\]
Taking the square root of 250000, we get:
\[
\sqrt{250000} = 500
\]
So, Jim walks 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha walks. Martha gets to the same location by walking along the length and width of the field. Therefore, the distance Martha walks is:
\[
\text{Distance Martha walks} = 300 + 400 = 700
\]
So, Martha walks 700 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many feet less than Martha Jim walks. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim walks from the distance Martha walks:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200
\]
So, Jim walks 200 feet less than Martha.

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

   - Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
   - Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)

From all the calculations, the minimum distance is 13. Therefore, the shortest distance that can be travelled is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
