"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) radians counterclockwise is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[

"To determine the smallest number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles.

The angle of rotation that brings the pentagon back to its original position is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, the point \((6, -1)\) cannot be the fourth vertex. Let's consider another pair of diagonals.

Let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

And the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting these midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8\) and \(y = 9\) satisfy \(x > 7\), the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\).

Finally, we find \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{5} \]","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) without direct calculation, we can use algebraic manipulation. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that reveals a pattern.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but not quite. Instead, let's consider the expression in terms of a substitution. Let \(x = 99\). Then the expression becomes:
\[x^2 + x + 1.\]

We can factor this expression using the identity for the sum of a geometric series. The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}\) is given by:
\[a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1},\]
where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms. In our case, \(a = 1\), \(r = x\), and \(n = 3\). Therefore, we have:
\[x^2 + x + 1 = \frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1}.\]

Substituting back \(x = 99\), we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}.\]

Now, we need to calculate \(99^3 - 1\). Notice that:
\[99^3 = (100 - 1)^3.\]

Using the binomial theorem, we expand \((100 - 1)^3\):
\[(100 - 1)^3 = 100^3 - 3 \cdot 100^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 100 \cdot 1^2 - 1^3 = 1000000 - 30000 + 300 - 1 = 970300 - 1 = 970299.\]

Therefore, we have:
\[99^3 - 1 = 970299.\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{970299}{98}.\]

Now, we perform the division:
\[970299 \div 98 = 9901.\]

Thus, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is:

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.

Thus, the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) is \(\sqrt{17}\). Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine how many treeks weigh the same as one squig. Let's define the weight of one squig as \( S \), the weight of one treek as \( T \), and the weight of one goolee as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. A treek weighs as much as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to eliminate \( G \) to find the relationship between \( T \) and \( S \). First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides of the equation:
\[
3T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 3:
\[
T = \frac{4S}{3}
\]

This tells us that the weight of one treek is \(\frac{4}{3}\) times the weight of one squig. To find out how many treeks weigh the same as one squig, we need to determine how many times \(\frac{4}{3}\) fits into 1. This is the same as dividing 1 by \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[
\text{Number of treeks} = 1 \div \frac{4}{3} = 1 \times \frac{3}{4} = \frac{3}{4}
\]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the rate at which the volume of water in the tank changes and relate it to the rate at which the height of the water changes.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the volume of water in the tank increases at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per minute. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We are also given that after the tank is filled, the height of the water increases at a rate of 4 meters per minute. This can be written as:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the radius \( r \), we need to use the relationship between the rates of change of the volume and the height. We start by differentiating the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the two pieces of the function.

Therefore, we need:
\[a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.\]

To solve this inequality, we rearrange it:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
We factor out \(a\):
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
We factor the quadratic expression:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]

We determine the roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[(-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[(-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[(1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[(3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

We also check the roots:
- For \(a = -1\):
  \[(-1)(-1 - 2)(-1 + 1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 0\):
  \[(0)(0 - 2)(0 + 1) = (0)(-2)(1) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 2\):
  \[(2)(2 - 2)(2 + 1) = (2)(0)(3) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 2]\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to consider the second iterate of \(f\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that:
\[
f(f(x)) = x \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) is a solution. We are interested in non-trivial solutions, i.e., \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^4 x^2 + \lambda^3 x - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda^2 - 1\), we have:
\[
(\lambda^2 - 1)(-\lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda^2 x^2 + x - 1) = 0.
\]
So, either \(\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\) or \(-\lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda^2 x^2 + x - 1 = 0\). If \(\lambda^2 - 1 = 0\), then \(\lambda = 1\) or \(\lambda = -1\). Since \(\lambda\) is in the interval \([0, 4]\), we have \(\lambda = 1\).

For \(\lambda = 1\), we have:
\[
f(x) = x(1 - x) \quad \text{and} \quad f(f(x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x + x^2) = x(1 - x + x^2 - x + x^2) = x(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = x.

So, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), and there are no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\).

Now, we need to check if there are any other values of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0, 4]\) for which \(-\lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda^2 x^2 + x - 1 = 0\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). We can use the intermediate value theorem. Let \(g(x) = -\lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda^2 x^2 + x - 1\). Then:
\[
g(0) = -1 \quad \text{and} \quad g(1) = -\lambda^2 + \lambda^2 + 1 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(g(0) = -1\) and \(g(1) = 0\), by the intermediate value theorem, there exists an \(x \in (0,1)\) such that \(g(x) = 0\). We need to check if \(f(x) \neq x\) for this \(x\). If \(x\) is a root of \(g(x) = 0\), then:
\[
-\lambda^2 x^3 + \lambda^2 x^2 + x - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda^2 x^2 (1 - x) = 1 - x.
\]
If \(x \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(1 - x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{\lambda^2} \implies x = \frac{1}{\lambda} \quad \text{(since \(x \in [0,1]\), we take the positive root)}.
\]
For \(f(x) \neq x\), we need:
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = 1 - \frac{1}{\lambda} \neq \frac{1}{\lambda}.
\]
This inequality holds if \(\lambda \neq 2\). Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the expression for \(\tan \theta\):
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ.
\]
Thus, the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)\) to simplify the numerator:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ.
\]

For the denominator, we use the identity \(\sin A - \cos B = \sin A - \sin(90^\circ - B) = \sin A - \sin(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin A - \sin 85^\circ\):
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin A - \sin B = 2 \cos\left(\frac{A + B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A - B}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ = 2 \cos\left(\frac{25^\circ + 85^\circ}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{25^\circ - 85^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \sin(-30^\circ) = 2 \cos 55^\circ \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = -\cos 55^\circ.
\]

Thus, the expression for \(\tan \theta\) becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{\sin 35^\circ}{\cos 55^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin 35^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 35^\circ) = \cos 55^\circ\), we get:
\[
\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3} \cdot \frac{\cos 55^\circ}{\cos 55^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Therefore, \(\theta = \tan^{-1}(-\sqrt{3})\). The angle whose tangent is \(-\sqrt{3}\) in the interval \([0^\circ, 360^\circ)\) is \(120^\circ\). The mindste positive vinkel is:

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Next, we need to calculate \( 7! \) and \( 3! \):
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the interior of the domain. To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we obtain:
\[ \sqrt{(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2)} = xy \]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]
This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. Therefore, the critical points occur on the boundary of this circle.

Now, let's evaluate \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). We can parameterize the circle using \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \]
Since \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \), we have:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \]
Therefore, the value of \( f(x, y) \) on the circle is 1.

Since the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1 and the value of \( f(x, y) \) on the circle is also 1, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) in the entire domain is:

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangle to the full height of the triangle. Because \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:

Next, we need to find the number of positive integer factors of 50. The prime factorization of 50 is:
\[ 50 = 2^1 \times 5^2 \]

The formula to find the number of factors of a number from its prime factorization is to add 1 to each of the exponents in the factorization and then multiply the results. For 50, the exponents are 1 and 2. Adding 1 to each exponent gives us 2 and 3. Multiplying these together, we get:
\[ (1+1)(2+1) = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Thus, the number of positive integer factors of 50 is 6. Therefore, the number of positive integer factors that are common to both 100 and 150 is:

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) the number \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:

"To determine how many five-cent coins Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( t \) be the number of ten-cent coins.
- Let \( f \) be the number of five-cent coins.

According to the problem, the total value of all the coins is 75 cents. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[ 10t + 5f = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 2t + f = 15 \]

This equation tells us that the number of five-cent coins is 15 minus twice the number of ten-cent coins. Since \( t \) and \( f \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find the possible values for \( t \) and \( f \) that satisfy this equation. Let's list the possible values for \( t \) and the corresponding values for \( f \):

- If \( t = 0 \), then \( f = 15 \).
- If \( t = 1 \), then \( f = 13 \).
- If \( t = 2 \), then \( f = 11 \).
- If \( t = 3 \), then \( f = 9 \).
- If \( t = 4 \), then \( f = 7 \).
- If \( t = 5 \), then \( f = 5 \).
- If \( t = 6 \), then \( f = 3 \).
- If \( t = 7 \), then \( f = 1 \).

Since the problem does not specify the exact number of ten-cent coins, any of these pairs \((t, f)\) could be a solution. However, the problem asks specifically for the number of five-cent coins. From the list above, we see that \( f \) can be any odd number from 1 to 15. Without additional information to narrow it down further, the most general answer is that Hillary has an odd number of five-cent coins.

If we assume the problem is asking for a specific solution without additional constraints, we can choose any valid pair. For simplicity, let's assume the problem is asking for a specific solution without additional constraints. If we assume the problem is asking for a specific solution without additional constraints.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and the rest are odd numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we count the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is \(1 \times 1 = 1\) way for both Paul and Jesse to choose an even number.

For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are \(5 \times 5 = 25\) ways for both Paul and Jesse to choose an odd number.

Adding these together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Area of the First Triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where all digits are either 0 or 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the remaining part of the number (after the trailing zeros) is a multiple of 2 and \(3^2 = 9\). Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the part of the number without the trailing zeros must be a binary number that is a multiple of 9.

We will check the smallest binary numbers to find the smallest one that is a multiple of 9:

- \(1_2 = 1_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(10_2 = 2_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)
- \(11_2 = 3_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)

- \(1000_2 = 8_{10}\) (not a multiple of 9)

A standard chessboard has 64 squares, with 32 black squares and 32 white squares.

We need to find the probability that the intersection of these conditions results in a black square.

First, let's determine the possible remainders for the first number when divided by 4. The possible remainders are 1, 2, or 3. This means that the first number can be written in the form \(4k + r\) where \(r\) is 1, 2, or 3, and \(k\) is an integer. Since each remainder is equally likely, the probability that the first number leaves a remainder of 1, 2, or 3 when divided by 4 is \(\frac{3}{4}\).

Next, let's determine the possible remainders for the second number when divided by 5. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means that the second number can be written in the form \(5m + s\) where \(s\) is 1, 2, 3, or 4, and \(m\) is an integer. Since each remainder is equally likely, the probability that the second number leaves a remainder of 1, 2, 3, or 4 when divided by 5 is \(\frac{4}{5}\).

Now, we need to determine the probability that the intersection of these conditions results in a black square. On a standard chessboard, the black squares are arranged in a checkerboard pattern, with black squares in the positions (1,1), (1,3), (2,2), (2,4), etc. This means that a black square is in a position where the sum of the row and column indices is odd.

The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,

\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x.

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Since \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.
\]

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\). Squaring both sides of the equation \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ) = (3\sqrt{3})^2\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(-\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}) = 27,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 6 + \frac{2}{\tan^2 10^\circ} = 27,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + \frac{2}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 80^\circ = \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + 2 + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,
\]
\[
4 + 2(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ) - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,
\]
\[
2(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ) - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 29,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - \sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 14.5.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 14.5,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 14.5 - 2 = 12.5.
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.5.
\]

Finally, we substitute this back into our expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 12.5 = 15.5.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we start by recalling the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2)^\circ
\]

Let the measure of the interior angle that is excluded be \(x^\circ\). According to the problem, the sum of the remaining interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
180(n-2) - x = 1070
\]

Rearranging this equation to solve for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 180(n-2) - 1070
\]

Since \(x\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must satisfy the inequality \(0 < x < 180^\circ\). Substituting the expression for \(x\) into this inequality, we have:

\[
0 < 180(n-2) - 1070 < 180
\]

We will solve this compound inequality in two parts. First, solve \(0 < 180(n-2) - 1070\):

\[
1070 < 180(n-2)
\]

Divide both sides by 180:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} < n-2
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
\frac{107}{18} < n-2
\]

Convert \(\frac{107}{18}\) to a decimal:

\[
5.9444\ldots < n-2
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
7.9444\ldots < n
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \geq 8
\]

Next, solve \(180(n-2) - 1070 < 180\):

\[
180(n-2) < 1250
\]

Divide both sides by 180:

\[
n-2 < \frac{1250}{180}
\]

Simplify the fraction:

\[
n-2 < \frac{125}{18}
\]

Convert \(\frac{125}{18}\) to a decimal:

\[
n-2 < 6.9444\ldots
\]

Add 2 to both sides:

\[
n < 8.9444\ldots
\]

Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:

\[
n \leq 8
\]

Combining the two parts of the inequality, we get:

\[
8 \leq n \leq 8
\]

Therefore, the only possible value for \(n\) is 8. To verify, we calculate the sum of the interior angles of an octagon:

\[
180(8-2) = 180 \times 6 = 1080^\circ
\]

If one interior angle is excluded, the sum of the remaining interior angles is:

\[
1080^\circ - x = 1070^\circ
\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[
x = 1080^\circ - 1070^\circ = 10^\circ
\]

Since \(10^\circ\) is a valid interior angle for a convex polygon, our solution is correct. Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is:

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to solve the congruence:
\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This can be rewritten as:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}, \]
where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\

10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.

We see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since \( t \) must satisfy \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). To verify, we check:
\[ t(t+2) = 4(4+2) = 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
Thus, the unique integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube) to get the total surface area.

First, let's find the side length of the cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one face of the cube. Since each face is a square with side length 1 foot, the area \( A \) of one face is:
\[ A = s^2 = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

Finally, we find the total surface area of the cube by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6):
\[ \text{Total surface area} = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25

\[

"To find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

and
\[

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines given by \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is the length of the projection of the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\) onto a vector perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b}\). This can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

The rectangle is defined by the inequalities:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
\[
-4 < y < 4
\]

First, let's consider the possible integer values for \(x\). The inequality \(-5 < x < 5\) means that \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are:
\[
-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
\]
This gives us 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

Next, let's consider the possible integer values for \(y\). The inequality \(-4 < y < 4\) means that \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, the possible integer values for \(y\) are:
\[

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[

\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

"To find the average price of Juan's frimærker in the 1970s, we need to calculate the total cost of all the frimærker he bought in that decade and then divide by the number of frimærker.

First, let's determine the total cost for each country in the 1970s:

1. **Brazil**: The number of frimærker is 12, and each frimærke costs 6 cents.
   \[
   12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ cents}
   \]

2. **France**: The number of frimærker is 15, and each frimærke costs 4 cents.
   \[
   15 \times 4 = 60 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Peru**: The number of frimærker is 6, and each frimærke costs 4 cents.
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ cents}
   \]

4. **Spain**: The number of frimærker is 9, and each frimærke costs 5 cents.
   \[
   9 \times 5 = 45 \text{ cents}
   \]

Next, we sum the total costs for all the countries:
\[
72 + 60 + 24 + 45 = 201 \text{ cents}
\]

Now, we need to find the average price by dividing the total cost by the total number of frimærker. The total number of frimærker in the 1970s is:
\[
12 + 15 + 6 + 9 = 42
\]

The average price is:
\[
\frac{201}{42} \approx 4.7857
\]

Rounding 4.7857 to the nearest tenth, we get:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Also, \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), so \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
where \(h\) is the height of the trapezoid. Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(h = c\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42 \implies (a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times c
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(A\) to \(BC\) and \(CD\) respectively. The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) is equal to the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal. Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

To ensure that our solution is valid, we need to check that it does not make the denominator of the original equation zero. The denominator is \(\sqrt{3x-1}\), so we need to check that \(3x - 1 > 0\):

\[
3 \left(\frac{9}{19}\right) - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19}

\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the operation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( m \) and \( p \):

\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the multiplication by canceling out the common factor between 70 and 30. The greatest common divisor of 70 and 30 is 10. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
70 \cdot \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \cdot 21}{30} = \frac{7 \cdot 10 \cdot 21}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{7 \cdot 21}{3}

Now, we simplify \(\frac{7 \cdot 21}{3}\). The number 21 can be divided by 3:

\[

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment crosses the other. This means that if we list the points in clockwise order, the points must alternate between the two segments. For example, if the points are labeled in clockwise order as \(A, C, B, D\), then the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we can fix one point and arrange the remaining 3 points. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following two patterns: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). There are 2 such favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the combined area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the combined area of the shaded regions is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the combined area of the shaded regions is:
\[
\text{Combined area of the shaded regions} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, let's consider the geometry of the problem. The shaded regions consist of two parts: a segment of the larger circle and a segment of the smaller circle. The angle \(\angle ADC\) is the central angle for both segments.

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
\]

Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

The combined area of the shaded regions is the sum of the areas of the segments of the larger and smaller circles:
\[
\text{Combined area of the shaded regions} = (2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)) + \left(\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5\sin(\theta)}{2}
\]

We know this combined area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5\sin(\theta)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

We can divide both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

To solve this equation, we need to find the value of \(\theta\) that satisfies it. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution:
\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

However, this does not satisfy the equation. Instead, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is indeed the correct solution. Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees is:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180}{\pi} = 120^\circ

Thus, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical barrel and the spherical tank, and then find out how many times the volume of the cylindrical barrel fits into the volume of the spherical tank.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical barrel. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical barrel, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the cylindrical barrel fits into the volume of the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical barrel:
\[ \text{Number of barrels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a senseatsklíte with 8 republikaners and 6 demokraters, such that at least one member is from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., all members are from the same party).

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members.**

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 republikaners + 6 demokraters) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party.**

There are two cases to consider: all members are republikaners or all members are demokraters.

- **Case 1: All members are republikaners.**

The number of ways to choose 5 republikaners from 8 is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

- **Case 2: All members are demokraters.**

The number of ways to choose 5 demokraters from 6 is:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6

The total number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party is the sum of the two cases:

\[
56 + 6 = 62

Simplifying the left side, we get:

This can be rewritten using the difference of squares:

\[

"To find the value of \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. To do this, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.
\]

This product includes \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\). We know that \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right)\). Therefore, we can write:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{5} \right) \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right).
\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{8} \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the height, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(AB = AC\)), we have:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - \cos(3\theta)).
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)) = 2BD^2 (4\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^3(\theta)) = 8BD^2 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 8BD^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]

Next, we need to find \(BD\). In triangle \(ABD\), we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 - AD^2 = AB^2 - 10^2 = AB^2 - 100.
\]
In triangle \(AMC\), we also use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 = 11^2 + MC^2 = 121 + MC^2.
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + MC^2.
\]
From the above equation, we can express \(AB^2\) as:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + MC^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4}.
\]
Substituting \(AB^2\) into the equation for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4} - 100 = 21 + \frac{BC^2}{4}.
\]
Now, substitute \(BD^2\) into the equation for \(BC^2\):
\[
BC^2 = 8 \left(21 + \frac{BC^2}{4}\right) \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 8 \cdot 21 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) + 2BC^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
BC^2 - 2BC^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 168 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta),
\]
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)) = 168 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\), we have:
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta))) = 168 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)),
\]
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^3(\theta)) = 168 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)),
\]
\[
BC^2 (2\cos^3(\theta) - 2\cos(\theta) + 1) = 168 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)).
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BAC = \theta\), we know that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) (this can be verified by solving the trigonometric equation). Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
BC^2 \left(2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 - 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1\right) = 168 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right),
\]
\[
BC^2 \left(2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} - 1 + 1\right) = 168 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4},
\]
\[
BC^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 168 \cdot \frac{3}{8},
\]
\[
BC^2 = 168 \cdot \frac{3}{8} \cdot 4 = 168 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 252.
\]
Therefore, \(BC = \sqrt{252} = 6\sqrt{7}\).

Now, we find \(AB\):
\[
AB^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4} = 121 + \frac{252}{4} = 121 + 63 = 184,
\]
\[
AB = \sqrt{184} = 2\sqrt{46}.
\]
The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{46} + 2\sqrt{46} + 6\sqrt{7} = 4\sqrt{46} + 6\sqrt{7}.

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms. In this problem, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\). Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
\frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that the sum of the sequence is \(3^7\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]
Solving for \(a\), we find:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence. The 14th number is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real values of \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real values of \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  This interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we substitute back:

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the results from both steps, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine for which class the number of male buspassengers is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female buspassengers, we need to calculate the ratio of male buspassengers to female buspassengers for each class and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female buspassengers for each class. Since there are 300 dreesge and 300 piger in each class, the number of male buspassengers is the percentage of dreesge multiplied by 300, and the number of female buspassengers is the percentage of piger multiplied by 300.

For the \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\) class:
- Male buspassengers: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
- Female buspassengers: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.04\)

For the \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\) class:
- Male buspassengers: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
- Female buspassengers: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04\)

For the \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\) class:
- Male buspassengers: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
- Female buspassengers: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

For the \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) class:
- Male buspassengers: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
- Female buspassengers: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
- Ratio: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.35\)

Now, we compare the ratios to \(1.35\):
- The ratio for the \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\) class is approximately \(1.04\).
- The ratio for the \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\) class is approximately \(1.04\).
- The ratio for the \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\) class is approximately \(1.5\).
- The ratio for the \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) class is approximately \(1.35\).

The ratio for the \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) class is closest to \(1.35\). Therefore, the class with the number of male buspassengers closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female buspassengers is the \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular mark, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two half-circles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width of the rectangle by \( W \). The two half-circles have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{W}{2} \) is given by:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W
\]
Since there are two half-circles, the total length of the curved parts of the track is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi W}{2} = \pi W
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two half-circles:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) to find the area of the rectangle. Solving for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting \( L \) from the equation above:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W
\]
\[
200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)
\]
\[
L = 200 - 100
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Therefore, the largest possible area of the mark is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since side lengths are positive), we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is also defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):

So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]

\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]

So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, there is no solution for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces. The vertices can be arranged such that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the distance between any two adjacent vertices (the edge length) is the same.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a square and \(E\) and \(F\) are the apexes of the two pyramids. The edge length of the octahedron is the same for all edges.

Given the distances from point \(P\) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex.

First, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property of regular polyhedra.

Let \(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6\) be the distances from point \(P\) to the vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) respectively. According to the property, we have:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = k
\]
where \(k\) is a constant.

We are given:
\[
d_1 = 3, \quad d_2 = 7, \quad d_3 = 8, \quad d_4 = 9, \quad d_5 = 11
\]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d_6^2 = k
\]

Calculating the squares:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d_6^2 = k
\]

Summing the known squares:
\[
324 + d_6^2 = k
\]

To find \(k\), we need to use another property of the regular octahedron. The sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is equal to four times the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices.

The center of the octahedron is equidistant from all vertices. Let \(R\) be the circumradius of the octahedron. The distance from the center to any vertex is \(R\). Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from the center to all vertices is:
\[
6R^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant, we have:
\[
k = 4 \times 6R^2 = 24R^2
\]

We need to find \(R\). The edge length \(a\) of the octahedron can be related to the circumradius \(R\) by the formula:
\[
R = \frac{a\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

However, we do not need the exact value of \(a\) to find \(d_6\). We can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant.

Given the symmetry and the properties of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is equal to four times the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices.

Thus, we have:
\[
d_6^2 = k - 324
\]

Since \(k\) is a constant, we can use the property to find \(d_6\). Given the symmetry and the properties of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is equal to four times the sum of the squares of the distances from the center of the octahedron to its vertices.

Thus, we have:

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the softball with the same force as Jack throws the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each object, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the softball and the baseball:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Simplify the numerator:

abc = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

We can expand this product using the identity for the sum of products of roots taken two at a time:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[
abc = (-2)(-2) - 0 = 4.
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(abc = 4\), the numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 4 = 0\). Solving this polynomial, we find:
\[
t^3 = 4 \implies t = \sqrt[3]{4}, \quad t = \sqrt[3]{4} \omega, \quad t = \sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2,
\]
where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) is a primitive cube root of unity. Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\{\sqrt[3]{4}, \sqrt[3]{4} \omega, \sqrt[3]{4} \omega^2\}}.
\]","[{4**(1/3), 4**(1/3)*omega, 4**(1/3)*omega**2}, '\\{\\sqrt[3]{4}, \\sqrt[3]{4} \\omega, \\sqrt[3]{4} \\omega^2\\}']","\{1\pm\sqrt{5},-2\}",[],False
"To determine the cost of one blyant, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( b \) be the cost of one blyant in dollars.
- Let \( v \) be the cost of one jumboviskenæder in dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( 3b + v = 1.24 \)
2. \( 2b + v = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( v \), we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:
\[
(3b + v) - (2b + v) = 1.24 - 1.82
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
3b + v - 2b - v = b
\]
So, we have:
\[
b = 1.24 - 1.82
\]
Subtracting the numbers, we get:
\[
b = -0.58
\]
However, this result is incorrect. Let's recheck the problem and correct the equations.

 correct equations:
1. \( 3b + v = 1.24 \)
2. \( 2b + v = 1.82 \)

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\):

\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). To identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point, we look at the digits in the decimal expansion: \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\).

Among these digits, the last non-zero digit is \(4\).

Thus, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need \(d(P, O) < d(P, A)\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we need \(d(P, O) < d(P, B)\), \(d(P, O) < d(P, C)\), and \(d(P, O) < d(P, D)\). These inequalities are:
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Combining all these inequalities, we get:
\[
\left| ax \right| + \left| by \right| < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This inequality represents a region inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) that is symmetric about both the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis. To find the area of this region, we consider the first quadrant where \(x \geq 0\) and \(y \geq 0\). In this quadrant, the inequality simplifies to:
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This is the equation of a line. The line intersects the \(x\)-axis at \(x = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and the \(y\)-axis at \(y = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\). The area of the region in the first quadrant is a right triangle with base \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and height \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\):
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a} \times \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{8ab}
\]

Since the region is symmetric in all four quadrants, the total area of the region where \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is:
\[
4 \times \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{8ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{2ab}
\]

The area of the entire rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the region to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{2ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{8a^2b^2} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{(2ab)^2} = \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2ab} \right)^2
\]

Given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the probability expression:
\[
\text{Probability} = \left( \frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{2(kb)b} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{2k b^2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{2k b^2} \right)^2 = \left( \frac{k^2 + 1}{2k} \right)^2 = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}}

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
\[54 = 6q + r\]
where \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get:
\[r = 0\]

Thus, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many cents of change Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie had left after converting their money to dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money they sold:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. **Add the amounts step by step:**
   - First, add Linda and Sherry's amounts:
     \[
     27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
     \]
   - Next, add June's amount to the result:
     \[
     62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
     \]
   - Finally, add Connie's amount to the result:
     \[
     100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
     \]

   So, the total amount of money they sold is \$126.59.

3. **Convert the total amount to dollars and cents:**
   - The total amount \$126.59 consists of 126 dollars and 59 cents.

4. **Determine the change after converting to dollars:**
   - Since they converted all their money to dollars, there is no change in dollars.
   - The remaining amount is the cents part of the total amount.

Therefore, the number of cents of change they had left is \(\boxed{59}\).","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average (mean) score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores. We do this by multiplying the number of students who got each score by the score itself, and then adding these products together.

The number of students who got 80 is 20, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The number of students who got 90 is 8, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The number of students who got 100 is 2, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these three amounts together to get the total sum of all the scores:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of students to find the average score. There are 30 students in the class, so we divide 2520 by 30:
\[ 2520 \div 30 = 84 \]

Therefore, the average score of the class is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) for the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's start by calculating the sum of the numbers in the first row:

\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:

\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:

\[
1 = n - 6
\]

Then, we add 6 to both sides:

\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we check the sums of the columns and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the first column is:

\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The sum of the second column is:

\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]

The sum of the third column is:

\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right) is:

\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 14 - 9 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left) is:

\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 14 - 9 + 2 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

\[
\boxed{7}

"To determine how many feet less Jim goes compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally over the mark. The mark is a rectangle with a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet. The distance Jim travels is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]

Calculating the squares, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes along the length and the width of the mark. The length of the mark is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Therefore, the total distance Martha travels is:

\[
400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many feet less Jim goes compared to Martha. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim travels from the distance Martha travels:

\[
700 - 500 = 200 \text{ feet}
\]

So, Jim goes \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled if you start at any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visit the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum of these distances.

Let's consider each starting point and calculate the total distance for all possible routes.

**Starting at point \(A\):**
1. Route \(A \to B \to C \to D\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. Route \(A \to B \to D \to C\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
   \]
3. Route \(A \to C \to B \to D\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
4. Route \(A \to C \to D \to B\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
5. Route \(A \to D \to B \to C\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
6. Route \(A \to D \to C \to B\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]

The minimum distance starting at \(A\) is 13.

**Starting at point \(B\):**
1. Route \(B \to A \to C \to D\):
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16
   \]
2. Route \(B \to A \to D \to C\):
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
3. Route \(B \to C \to A \to D\):
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \(B \to C \to D \to A\):
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14

5. Route \(B \to D \to A \to C\):
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. Route \(B \to D \to C \to A\):
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13

The minimum distance starting at \(B\) is 13.

   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
5. Route \(C \to D \to A \to B\):
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]
6. Route \(C \to D \to B \to A\):
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting at \(C\) is 13.

**Starting at point \(D\):**
1. Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
2. Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16

   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
