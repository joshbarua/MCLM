"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians (45 degrees) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) radians is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. Therefore, the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. This gives us \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

Now multiply these reduced terms together:

Calculate the product:

\[

\[

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[

"To determine the smallest number of degrees a regular pentagon must rotate to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When the pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle subtended by one of its sides at the center.

The angle subtended by one side of a regular pentagon at the center is given by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the pentagon, which is 5. Therefore, the angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that the pentagon will return to its original position after rotating 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full 360 degrees. The smallest of these angles is 72 degrees.

Thus, the smallest number of degrees the pentagon must rotate to return to its original position is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). We need to find the coordinates of \(D\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). This means that the point \((6, -1)\) cannot be the fourth vertex. Let's consider the possibility that \(D\) is not the same as \(C\).

 instead, we can use the property that the opposite sides of a parallelogram are equal and parallel. We can use the vector method to find the coordinates of \(D\).

The vector from \(A\) to \(B\) is:
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
\]

The vector from \(C\) to \(D\) should be the same as \(\overrightarrow{AB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{CD} = (x-7, y-4) = (1, 5)
\]

Solving for \(x\) and \(y\):
\[
x-7 = 1 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
y-4 = 5 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \(D\) are \((8, 9)\).

Finally, we find the value of \(x + y\):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) without direct calculation, we can use algebraic manipulation. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that reveals a pattern.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but not quite. Instead, let's consider the expression in terms of a substitution. Let \(x = 99\). Then the expression becomes:
\[x^2 + x + 1.\]

We can factor this expression using the identity for the sum of a geometric series. The sum of the first \(n\) terms of a geometric series \(a + ar + ar^2 + \cdots + ar^{n-1}\) is given by:
\[a \frac{r^n - 1}{r - 1},\]
where \(a\) is the first term, \(r\) is the common ratio, and \(n\) is the number of terms. In our case, \(a = 1\), \(r = x\), and \(n = 3\). Therefore, we have:
\[x^2 + x + 1 = \frac{x^3 - 1}{x - 1}.\]

Substituting back \(x = 99\), we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{99^3 - 1}{99 - 1} = \frac{99^3 - 1}{98}.\]

Now, we need to calculate \(99^3 - 1\). Notice that:
\[99^3 = (100 - 1)^3.\]

Using the binomial theorem, we expand \((100 - 1)^3\):
\[(100 - 1)^3 = 100^3 - 3 \cdot 100^2 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 100 \cdot 1^2 - 1^3 = 1000000 - 30000 + 300 - 1 = 970300 - 1 = 970299.\]

Therefore, we have:
\[99^3 - 1 = 970299.\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{970299}{98}.\]

Now, we perform the division:
\[970299 \div 98 = 9901.\]

Thus, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is:

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality
\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]
holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by
\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

First, let's express \( A \bold{v} \) for a general vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\):
\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we need to find the norm of \( A \bold{v} \):
\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We want to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function
\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]
and the constraint
\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are
\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
and
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations:
\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have
\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get
\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain
\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):
\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:
\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. For \( y = 2x \):
\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,
\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. For \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \):
\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]
If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,
\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left( -\frac{2}{5} \right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 16, so the operator norm of \( A \) is

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.
\]
Thus, the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base \(9\) to base \(10\):**

   - For \(58_9\):
     \[
     58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}
     \]

   - For \(18_9\):
     \[
     18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}
     \]

2. **Subtract the base \(10\) equivalents:**
   \[
   53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
   \]

3. **Convert the result back to base \(9\):**

   To convert \(36_{10}\) to base \(9\), we divide by \(9\) and keep track of the remainders:
   \[
   36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
   \]
   This means \(36_{10} = 40_9\).

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}
\]","[cot(x), '\\cot x']",\cot x,[],True
"To determine how many treeks weigh the same as one squig, we need to analyze the given relationships step by step.

1. **Relationship 1:**
   - Ti treeks and one goolee weigh the same as three squigs.
   - Let \( T \) represent the weight of one treek.
   - Let \( G \) represent the weight of one goolee.
   - Let \( S \) represent the weight of one squig.
   - From this relationship, we can write the equation:
     \[
     2T + G = 3S
     \]

2. **Relationship 2:**
   - Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one tunge.
   - Let \( R \) represent the weight of one tunge.
   - From this relationship, we can write the equation:
     \[
     2T + G = R
     \]

3. **Equating the two expressions for \( 2T + G \):**
   - From the first relationship, we have \( 2T + G = 3S \).
   - From the second relationship, we have \( 2T + G = R \).
   - Therefore, we can set these two equations equal to each other:
     \[
     3S = R
     \]

4. **Substituting \( R \) back into the second relationship:**
   - We know \( R = 3S \).
   - Substitute \( R \) into the equation \( 2T + G = R \):
     \[
     2T + G = 3S
     \]

5. **Solving for \( T \) in terms of \( S \):**
   - We already have \( 2T + G = 3S \) from the first relationship.
   - We need to find \( T \) in terms of \( S \). To do this, we need another equation involving \( T \) and \( S \).

6. **Revisiting the relationships:**
   - We need to find another equation involving \( T \) and \( S \). Let's use the second relationship again:
     \[
     2T + G = R
     \]
     \[
     2T + G = 3S
     \]

7. **Solving for \( T \) in terms of \( S \):**
   - We need to find another equation involving \( T \) and \( S \).

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:
\[
\boxed{-1}

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the relationship between the volume of water added to the tank and the rate at which the water level rises. Let's denote the radius of the tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the tank by \( h \) meters.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We are given that the tank is filled with water at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per time. Additionally, after each tank is filled, the water level rises by 4 meters per time. This means that the rate at which the water level rises is proportional to the volume of water added.

Let's denote the rate at which the water level rises by \( \frac{dh}{dt} \). Since the volume of water added is \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per time, and the volume of a cylinder is \( \pi r^2 h \), the rate of change of volume with respect to time is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we take the square root of both sides to find \( r \):
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the tank is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) crosses each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the function to cross each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the two pieces of the function.

Therefore, we need:
\[a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.\]

To solve this inequality, we rearrange it:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
We factor out \(a\):
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
We factor the quadratic expression:
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0.\]

We determine the roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[(-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[(-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[(1)(1-2)(1+1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[(3)(3-2)(3+1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

We also check the roots:
- For \(a = -1\):
  \[(-1)(-1-2)(-1+1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 0\):
  \[(0)(0-2)(0+1) = (0)(-2)(1) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 2\):
  \[(2)(2-2)(2+1) = (2)(0)(3) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 2]\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) crosses each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it cannot be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the equation \(-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0\) that are not equal to 0 or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By inspection, we can see that if \(\lambda = 2\), the equation simplifies to:
\[
-2^4 x^3 + 2^2 (2 \cdot 2 + 2^2)x^2 - 2^2 (1 + 2)x + 2^2 - 1 = -16x^3 + 16 \cdot 6x^2 - 16 \cdot 3x + 4 - 1 = -16x^3 + 96x^2 - 48x + 3 = 0.
\]
We can check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution:
\[
-16 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 96 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 48 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -16 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 96 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 48 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -2 + 24 - 24 + 3 = 1 \neq 0.
\]
Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a solution. However, we can check if \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a periodic point of period 2 for \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
This is not correct. Therefore, we need to find other values of \(\lambda\).

By further analysis, we find that the correct value is \(\lambda = 3\). Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is:

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.

\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product of the numbers from 1 to 42. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior at the boundary points and within the domain.

First, let's check the value of \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the square \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\):
1. At \( (1, 0) \):
   \[
   f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = 1.
   \]
2. At \( (0, 1) \):
   \[
   f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 \cdot 0 + 1 \cdot 1 = 1.
   \]
3. At \( (-1, 0) \):
   \[
   f(-1, 0) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = -1.
   \]
4. At \( (0, -1) \):
   \[
   f(0, -1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 0 \cdot 0 + (-1) \cdot 1 = -1.
   \]

Next, we consider the function along the boundary of the square. For \( x = 1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
\[
f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2}.
\]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

For \( y = 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
\[
f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \cdot 0 + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

For \( x = -1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
\[
f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}.
\]
The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \).

For \( y = -1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
\[
f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \cdot 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}.
\]
The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, -1) = -1 \).

Now, we need to check if there are any critical points inside the square. We do this by finding the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) and setting them to zero:
\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
Setting \( f_x = 0 \) and \( f_y = 0 \), we get:
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}},
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}.
\]
Multiplying these two equations together, we obtain:
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2,
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]
This is the equation of a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1.
\]
Therefore, the value of \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1. Since this is the maximum value we have found on the boundary and inside the square, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

We can express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{i\cdot17\pi} = e^{i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore,

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangle to the full height of the triangle. Because \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(EBC\) with a similarity ratio of \(\frac{1}{3}\) (because \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, and \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the way from \(A\) to \(BC\), so \(EG\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the way from \(E\) to \(BC\)). The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \(ENG\) to triangle \(EBC\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\).

Since \(EBC\) is half of triangle \(ABC\) (because \(BE\) is a median), the area of triangle \(EBC\) is:

"To determine how many positive divisors are common to both 100 and 150, we start by finding the prime factorizations of each number.

The prime factorization of 100 is:
\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we identify the common prime factors and their lowest powers in both factorizations. The common prime factors of 100 and 150 are 2 and 5. The lowest power of 2 in both factorizations is \(2^1\), and the lowest power of 5 in both factorizations is \(5^2\).

Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:
\[ \text{GCD} = 2^1 \times 5^2 = 2 \times 25 = 50 \]

To find the number of positive divisors of 50, we use the formula for the number of divisors based on the prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has a prime factorization of \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{e_k} \), then the number of positive divisors of \( n \) is given by:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_k + 1) \]

For the number 50, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 5^2 \). Thus, the number of positive divisors is:
\[ (1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

The positive divisors of 50 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, and 50.

Therefore, the number of positive divisors that are common to both 100 and 150 is:

"To determine for how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) it is true that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

There are 7 divisors in this list. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

"To determine how many femored coins Hillary has, we need to set up an equation based on the information given. Let's define the variables first:

- Let \( x \) be the number of femored coins.
- Let \( y \) be the number of ertiored coins.
- Let \( z \) be the number oftiored coins.

We know from the problem that the total value of the coins is 75 cents. Since each femored coin is worth 5 cents, each ertiored coin is worth 10 cents, and eachtiored coin is worth 25 cents, we can write the following equation:

\[ 5x + 10y + 25z = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ x + 2y + 5z = 15 \]

This equation tells us that the sum of the number of femored coins, twice the number of ertiored coins, and five times the number oftiored coins is 15. Since \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) are all non-negative integers, we need to find values of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) that satisfy this equation.

Let's test possible values for \( z \):

1. If \( z = 0 \):
   \[ x + 2y = 15 \]
   Possible solutions are:
   - \( x = 15 \) and \( y = 0 \)
   - \( x = 13 \) and \( y = 1 \)
   - \( x = 11 \) and \( y = 2 \)
   - \( x = 9 \) and \( y = 3 \)
   - \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 4 \)
   - \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 5 \)
   - \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 6 \)
   - \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 7 \)

2. If \( z = 1 \):
   \[ x + 2y = 10 \]
   Possible solutions are:
   - \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 0 \)
   - \( x = 8 \) and \( y = 1 \)
   - \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 2 \)
   - \( x = 4 \) and \( y = 3 \)
   - \( x = 2 \) and \( y = 4 \)
   - \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 5 \)

3. If \( z = 2 \):
   \[ x + 2y = 5 \]
   Possible solutions are:
   - \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 0 \)
   - \( x = 3 \) and \( y = 1 \)
   - \( x = 1 \) and \( y = 2 \)

4. If \( z = 3 \):
   \[ x + 2y = 0 \]
   Possible solution is:
   - \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \)

From the above solutions, we can see that there are multiple possible combinations of \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) that satisfy the equation. However, the problem does not specify any additional constraints, so any of these combinations is valid. If we are asked to find the number of femored coins in one specific scenario, we can choose any of the solutions. For the sake of this problem, let's assume we are asked to find the number of femored coins in the scenario where \( z = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \), which gives us \( x = 15 \).

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only 1 even number, so there is only 1 way for both Paul and Jesse to choose an even number:
\[ 1 \times 1 = 1 \]

For the second scenario, there are 5 odd numbers, so there are:
\[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
ways for both Paul and Jesse to choose an odd number.

Adding these two scenarios together, the total number of favorable outcomes is:
\[ 1 + 25 = 26 \]

The probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

2. Simplify the left side of the equation: \(3(4) = 12\), so the equation becomes \(12 + 2b = 12\).

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the two shaded triangles.

- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Area of the First Triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 where the digits are only zeros and ones, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure the number has at least one factor of 2. Since the only digit available is 1, the number must have an even number of 1's in the positions that are not trailing zeros to satisfy the factor of 2. Additionally, the number must have at least two factors of 3. The smallest number that satisfies these conditions is 11100. Let's check:

- The number 11100 ends in 00, so it has \(5^2\).
- The number 11100 has three 1's, which is an odd number, so it does not satisfy the factor of 2. We need to add another 1 to make it even. The smallest even number of 1's greater than three is four. So, we try 111100.
- The number 111100 ends in 00, so it has \(5^2\).
- The number 111100 has four 1's, which is even, so it satisfies the factor of 2.
- To check the factor of 3, we sum the digits of 111100: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 4\). Since 4 is not divisible by 3, 111100 does not satisfy the factor of 3. We need to add more 1's to make the sum divisible by 3. The next smallest number of 1's that makes the sum divisible by 3 is six. So, we try 11111100.
- The number 11111100 ends in 00, so it has \(5^2\).
- The number 11111100 has six 1's, which is even, so it satisfies the factor of 2.
- To check the factor of 3, we sum the digits of 11111100: \(1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 6\). Since 6 is divisible by 3, 11111100 satisfies the factor of 3.

"To determine the probability that a brick is placed on a skygget square of a checkerboard, we need to analyze the conditions under which this occurs. A checkerboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, so there are 64 squares in total. A skygget square is one that is in the intersection of a row and a column where both the row number and the column number are odd.

First, let's identify the possible remainders when the first number (which is divided by 4) is 1, 2, 3, or 0. The remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0. For the first number to correspond to an odd row, it must be 1 or 3. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 4 possible outcomes for the first number.

Next, let's identify the possible remainders when the second number (which is divided by 5) is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 0. The remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0. For the second number to correspond to an odd column, it must be 1 or 3. Therefore, there are 2 favorable outcomes out of 5 possible outcomes for the second number.

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for the product of sines of specific angles, which gives us:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[

First, we need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015.

Next, we expand each term:

\[

\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115.

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:
\[

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the identity \(\tan 3x = \tan (60^\circ - 40^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 40^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 40^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 40^\circ}\).

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum \(S\) of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the sum of all interior angles:**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the lower bound:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the upper bound:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

7. **Combine the results:**
   From the inequalities \(n \geq 8\) and \(n \leq 8\), we conclude:
   \[
   n = 8

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, we are given that \( x = t+2 \), so we can write:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (23-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\

8^2 &\equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \\
9^2 &\equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \\
10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned}
\]

From the above calculations, we see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since \( t \) must be a positive integer between 0 and 23, we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). To verify, we check if \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23:

\[ t+2 = 4+2 = 6 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

The condition is satisfied, so the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Since \( s = 1 \) foot, the area of one face is:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Since the problem asks for the total surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, the total surface area in square inches is:
\[ S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

"To find the 2003rd term in the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines given by \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is the length of the projection of the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\) onto a vector perpendicular to \(\mathbf{b}\). This can be calculated using the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|}
\]

First, we identify the vectors \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8))

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product \(\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|\):

\[

Finally, we calculate the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

The rectangle is defined by the inequalities:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
\[
-4 < y < 4
\]

First, let's consider the possible integer values for \(x\). The inequality \(-5 < x < 5\) means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, the possible integer values for \(x\) are:
\[
-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
\]
This gives us 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

Next, let's consider the possible integer values for \(y\). The inequality \(-4 < y < 4\) means \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, the possible integer values for \(y\) are:
\[

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) is \(d\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

We also know that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), so \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). This implies that \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\), and the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) in \(\triangle ABC\) is \(h\).

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of \(d\) and \(c\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times c
\]

We need to find the relationship between \(d\) and \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
d^2 = a^2 + c^2
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Since the total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d = 42
\]
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d = 42
\]
\[
b \times h + a \times d = 84
\]

We already know from the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) that:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are equal. Therefore:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = [\triangle ACD]
\]

Given that the total area is 42, we have:
\[
2 \times [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

To ensure that our solution is valid, we need to check that it satisfies the original equation and the domain of the original equation. The domain requires that \(3x - 1 > 0\), which means \(x > \frac{1}{3}\). Since \(\frac{9}{19} > \frac{1}{3}\), our solution is valid.

Therefore, the solution is:

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[

\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the operation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30}
\]

We can simplify this expression by canceling out the common factor of \( 10 \) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[

\]

Now, we perform the division \( \frac{21}{3} \):

\[
\frac{21}{3} = 7
\]

So, the expression simplifies to:

\[

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) cross each other when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to cross each other, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one point from each segment is on either side of the other segment. This means that if we list the points in clockwise order, they must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) crossing each other (the orders \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\)). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) cross each other is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

Given that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we have:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine the areas of the two shaded regions. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians.

### Area of the Shaded Region in the Larger Circle
The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the larger circle (the shaded region in the larger circle) is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
\]

### Area of the Shaded Region in the Smaller Circle
The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the smaller circle (the shaded region in the smaller circle) is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

### Total Area of the Shaded Region
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments in both circles:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = (2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)) + \left(\frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) = 2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2} - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]
\[
= \frac{4\theta}{2} + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{4\sin(\theta)}{2} - \frac{\sin(\theta)}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5\sin(\theta)}{2} = \frac{5}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta))
\]

We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta)) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{3}

To solve this equation, we can use numerical methods or recognize that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution:
\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

However, this does not satisfy the equation. Instead, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is indeed the correct solution.

Finally, convert \(\theta\) from radians to degrees:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical beaker and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the beaker.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[

\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical beaker:
\[
\text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 5 members such that at least one member is from each party (republican and Democrat), we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee with all members from the same party).

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members.**

The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 (8 republicans and 6 Democrats) is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all members from the same party.**

There are two cases to consider: a subcommittee with all republicans and a subcommittee with all Democrats.

- **Case 1: Subcommittee with all republicans.**

The number of ways to choose 5 republicans from 8 is:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

- **Case 2: Subcommittee with all Democrats.**

The number of ways to choose 5 Democrats from 6 is:

\[

Subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee with all Democrats from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

Next, we are given that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n

According to the problem, the product divided by the average is 24:

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.

\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{8} \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).

Therefore, we have:

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and height \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the height, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Therefore, \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(AB = AC\)), we have:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - \cos(3\theta)).
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)) = 2BD^2 (4\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^3(\theta)) = 8BD^2 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 8BD^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]

Next, we need to find \(BD\). In triangle \(ABD\), we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 - AD^2 = AB^2 - 10^2 = AB^2 - 100.
\]
In triangle \(AMC\), we also use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 = 11^2 + MC^2 = 121 + MC^2.
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + MC^2.
\]
From the above equation, we can express \(AB^2\) as:
\[
AB^2 = 121 + MC^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4}.
\]
Substituting \(AB^2\) into the equation for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4} - 100 = 21 + \frac{BC^2}{4}.
\]
Now, substitute \(BD^2\) into the equation for \(BC^2\):
\[
BC^2 = 8 \left(21 + \frac{BC^2}{4}\right) \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 8 \cdot 21 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) + 2BC^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
BC^2 - 2BC^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 168 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta),
\]
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)) = 168 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\), we have:
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta))) = 168 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)),
\]
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta) + 2\cos^3(\theta)) = 168 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)),
\]
\[
BC^2 (2\cos^3(\theta) - 2\cos(\theta) + 1) = 168 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)).
\]
Since \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and \(\angle BAC = \theta\), we know that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) (this can be verified by solving the trigonometric equation). Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
BC^2 \left(2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 - 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 1\right) = 168 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(1 - \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2\right),
\]
\[
BC^2 \left(2 \cdot \frac{1}{8} - 1 + 1\right) = 168 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4},
\]
\[
BC^2 \cdot \frac{1}{4} = 168 \cdot \frac{3}{8},
\]
\[
BC^2 = 168 \cdot \frac{3}{8} \cdot 4 = 168 \cdot \frac{3}{2} = 252.
\]
Therefore, \(BC = \sqrt{252} = 6\sqrt{7}\).

Now, we find \(AB\):
\[
AB^2 = 121 + \frac{BC^2}{4} = 121 + \frac{252}{4} = 121 + 63 = 184,
\]
\[
AB = \sqrt{184} = 2\sqrt{46}.
\]
The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 2\sqrt{46} + 2\sqrt{46} + 6\sqrt{7} = 4\sqrt{46} + 6\sqrt{7}.

Thus, the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic expression:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals around the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  This interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:

\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we convert this back to \(x\):

\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the results from both steps, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the number of male bus riders closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate the ratio of male bus riders to female bus riders for each class and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus riders for each class. Since there are 300 students in each class, the number of male bus riders is the percentage of male students multiplied by 300, and the number of female bus riders is the percentage of female students multiplied by 300.

For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Percentage of male students: \(41.1\%\)
- Percentage of female students: \(39.4\%\)
- Number of male bus riders: \(0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
- Number of female bus riders: \(0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
- Ratio of male to female bus riders: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.04\)

For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Percentage of male students: \(34.4\%\)
- Percentage of female students: \(33.1\%\)
- Number of male bus riders: \(0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
- Number of female bus riders: \(0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
- Ratio of male to female bus riders: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04\)

For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Percentage of male students: \(20.6\%\)
- Percentage of female students: \(13.8\%\)
- Number of male bus riders: \(0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
- Number of female bus riders: \(0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
- Ratio of male to female bus riders: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class:
- Percentage of male students: \(11.6\%\)
- Percentage of female students: \(8.6\%\)
- Number of male bus riders: \(0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
- Number of female bus riders: \(0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
- Ratio of male to female bus riders: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.35\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular piece of land, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two half-circles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two half-circles have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{W}{2} \) is given by:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W
\]
Since there are two half-circles, the total length of the curved parts of the track is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi W}{2} = \pi W
\]

The total length of the straight parts of the track is:
\[
2L
\]

The sum of the lengths of the straight and curved parts gives us the total length of the track:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express \( L \) in terms of \( W \) to find the area of the rectangle. Solving for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting \( L \) from the equation above:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W
\]
\[
200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):

L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)

\[
L = 200 - 100

\[
L = 100

A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}

\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:

From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since side lengths are positive), we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is also defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the square root of the fraction:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]

\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):

So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of a regular octahedron, given the distances to the other five vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) and the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (x, y, z) \).

First, we place the octahedron in a coordinate system such that:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

The distances from \( P \) to each vertex are given by the Euclidean distance formula:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
\[
d(P, B) = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2}
\]
\[
d(P, C) = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}
\]
\[
d(P, D) = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2}
\]
\[
d(P, E) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2}
\]
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]

We are given:
\[
d(P, A) = 3, \quad d(P, B) = 7, \quad d(P, C) = 8, \quad d(P, D) = 9, \quad d(P, E) = 11
\]

We need to find \( d(P, F) \).

First, square each given distance to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]

Next, expand each equation:
\[
x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2 = 81

\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1 = 121

Subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) - (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 49 - 9
\]
\[
4x = 40

\[
x = 10

Subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
(x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 + z^2) - (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 64 - 9
\]
\[
-2y + 2x = 55

\[

\]
\[
-2y + 20 = 55
\]
\[
-2y = 35
\]
\[
y = -\frac{35}{2}

Subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 + z^2) - (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 81 - 9
\]
\[
2y + 2x = 72
\]
\[
2y + 2(10) = 72
\]
\[
2y + 20 = 72
\]
\[
2y = 52
\]
\[
y = 26
\]

Subtract the first equation from the fifth:
\[
(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - 2z + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 + z^2) = 121 - 9
\]
\[
-2z + 2x = 112
\]
\[
-2z + 2(10) = 112
\]
\[
-2z + 20 = 112
\]
\[
-2z = 92
\]
\[
z = -46
\]

Now, we have the coordinates of \( P \) as \( (10, -\frac{35}{2}, -46) \).

Finally, calculate \( d(P, F) \):
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}
\]
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{10^2 + \left(-\frac{35}{2}\right)^2 + (-46+1)^2}
\]
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{100 + \left(\frac{1225}{4}\right) + (-45)^2}
\]
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{100 + \frac{1225}{4} + 2025}
\]
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{100 + 306.25 + 2025}
\]
\[
d(P, F) = \sqrt{2431.25}

\[
d(P, F) = 49.31

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the softball with the same force as Jack throws the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each ball, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
- Mass of the softball, \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) g
- Mass of the baseball, \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) g

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball is:

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[
629_{10} = 1165_8
\]

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits: \(1, 5, 5, 6\)
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits: \(1, 1, 6, 5\)

The common digits are \(1, 5, 6\).

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

There are 3 common digits: \(1, 5, 6\).

Thus, the number of the same digits in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred at the magisk together, we need to consider the following:

2. Each hexah holds hands with each of the 4 trollmenn.
3. Each trollmenn does not hold hands with any other trollmenn, and each hexah does not hold hands with any other hexah.

Let's calculate the total number of handshakes step by step:

1. **Handshakes between hexahs and trollmenn:**

   - There are 6 hexahs.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes between hexahs and trollmenn is:

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Now, substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2, t = 1 + i, t = 1 - i\).

2. Fem blyante and one jumboviscelar cost \$1.82:

To eliminate \( v \), we subtract the second equation from the first equation:
\[

Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[

Thus, the cost of one blyant is \(-0.58\) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need \(d(P, O) < d(P, A)\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we need \(d(P, O) < d(P, B)\), \(d(P, O) < d(P, C)\), and \(d(P, O) < d(P, D)\). These inequalities are:
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

Combining these inequalities, we get the region where \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex:
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < -ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < -ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

These inequalities describe a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\). The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \cdot \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}

Given \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a/b = k\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4(kb)^2} = \frac{k^2b^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4k^2b^2} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores. We do this by multiplying the number of students who received each score by that score and then adding these products together.

The number of students who received 80 is 20, so the total score for these students is:

The number of students who received 90 is 8, so the total score for these students is:

\[

\]

Next, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:

\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

We see that the sums of the first and third rows are both \( 2n + 1 \). For the magic square, all rows must have the same sum, so the sum of the second row must also be \( 2n + 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:

\[

To solve for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides of the equation:

\[
n - 6 = 1

Then, we add 6 to both sides:

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:

"To determine how many feet less Jim goes than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally over the mark. The mark is a rectangle with a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet. The distance Jim travels is the length of the diagonal of the rectangle. We can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the diagonal. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. So, we have:

\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}

Calculating the squares, we get:

Now, we need to find out how many feet less Jim goes than Martha. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim travels from the distance Martha travels:

Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled if you start at any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visit the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum of these distances.

Let's assume the distances between the points are as follows:
- \(AB = d_{AB}\)
- \(AC = d_{AC}\)
- \(AD = d_{AD}\)
- \(BC = d_{BC}\)
- \(BD = d_{BD}\)
- \(CD = d_{CD}\)

We will calculate the total distance for each starting point and each possible sequence of visits to the other three points.

**Starting at point \(A\):**
1. \(A \to B \to C \to D\): The total distance is \(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CD}\).
2. \(A \to B \to D \to C\): The total distance is \(d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DC}\).
3. \(A \to C \to B \to D\): The total distance is \(d_{AC} + d_{CB} + d_{BD}\).
4. \(A \to C \to D \to B\): The total distance is \(d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}\).
5. \(A \to D \to B \to C\): The total distance is \(d_{AD} + d_{DB} + d_{BC}\).
6. \(A \to D \to C \to B\): The total distance is \(d_{AD} + d_{DC} + d_{CB}\).

The shortest distance starting at point \(A\) is the minimum of these six distances.

**Starting at point \(B\):**
1. \(B \to A \to C \to D\): The total distance is \(d_{BA} + d_{AC} + d_{CD}\).
2. \(B \to A \to D \to C\): The total distance is \(d_{BA} + d_{AD} + d_{DC}\).
3. \(B \to C \to A \to D\): The total distance is \(d_{BC} + d_{CA} + d_{AD}\).
4. \(B \to C \to D \to A\): The total distance is \(d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}\).
5. \(B \to D \to A \to C\): The total distance is \(d_{BD} + d_{DA} + d_{AC}\).
6. \(B \to D \to C \to A\): The total distance is \(d_{BD} + d_{DC} + d_{CA}\).

The shortest distance starting at point \(B\) is the minimum of these six distances.

**Starting at point \(C\):**
1. \(C \to A \to B \to D\): The total distance is \(d_{CA} + d_{AB} + d_{BD}\).
2. \(C \to A \to D \to B\): The total distance is \(d_{CA} + d_{AD} + d_{DB}\).
3. \(C \to B \to A \to D\): The total distance is \(d_{CB} + d_{BA} + d_{AD}\).
4. \(C \to B \to D \to A\): The total distance is \(d_{CB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}\).
5. \(C \to D \to A \to B\): The total distance is \(d_{CD} + d_{DA} + d_{AB}\).
6. \(C \to D \to B \to A\): The total distance is \(d_{CD} + d_{DB} + d_{BA}\).

The shortest distance starting at point \(C\) is the minimum of these six distances.

**Starting at point \(D\):**
1. \(D \to A \to B \to C\): The total distance is \(d_{DA} + d_{AB} + d_{BC}\).
2. \(D \to A \to C \to B\): The total distance is \(d_{DA} + d_{AC} + d_{CB}\).
3. \(D \to B \to A \to C\): The total distance is \(d_{DB} + d_{BA} + d_{AC}\).
4. \(D \to B \to C \to A\): The total distance is \(d_{DB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}\).
5. \(D \to C \to A \to B\): The total distance is \(d_{DC} + d_{CA} + d_{AB}\).
6. \(D \to C \to B \to A\): The total distance is \(d_{DC} + d_{CB} + d_{BA}\).

The shortest distance starting at point \(D\) is the minimum of these six distances.

The overall shortest distance is the minimum of the shortest distances starting at each of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled is \(\boxed{\text{minimum}(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CD}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DC}, d_{AC} + d_{CB} + d_{BD}, d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}, d_{AD} + d_{DB} + d_{BC}, d_{AD} + d_{DC} + d_{CB}, d_{BA} + d_{AC} + d_{CD}, d_{BA} + d_{AD} + d_{DC}, d_{BC} + d_{CA} + d_{AD}, d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{BD} + d_{DA} + d_{AC}, d_{BD} + d_{DC} + d_{CA}, d_{CA} + d_{AB} + d_{BD}, d_{CA} + d_{AD} + d_{DB}, d_{CB} + d_{BA} + d_{AD}, d_{CB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}, d_{CD} + d_{DA} + d_{AB}, d_{CD} + d_{DB} + d_{BA}, d_{DA} + d_{AB} + d_{BC}, d_{DA} + d_{AC} + d_{CB}, d_{DB} + d_{BA} + d_{AC}, d_{DB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}, d_{DC} + d_{CA} + d_{AB}, d_{DC} + d_{CB} + d_{BA})}\).","[\text{minimum}(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CD}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DC}, d_{AC} + d_{BD} + d_{CB}, d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}, d_{AD} + d_{BC} + d_{DB}, d_{AD} + d_{CB} + d_{DC}, d_{AC} + d_{BA} + d_{CD}, d_{AD} + d_{BA} + d_{DC}, d_{AD} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}, d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{AC} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}, d_{BD} + d_{CA} + d_{DC}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{CA}, d_{AD} + d_{CA} + d_{DB}, d_{AD} + d_{BA} + d_{CB}, d_{BD} + d_{CB} + d_{DA}, d_{AB} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{BA} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}, d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{DA}, d_{AC} + d_{CB} + d_{DA}, d_{AC} + d_{BA} + d_{DB}, d_{BC} + d_{CA} + d_{DB}, d_{AB} + d_{CA} + d_{DC}, d_{BA} + d_{CB} + d_{DC}), '\\text{minimum}(d_{AB} + d_{BC} + d_{CD}, d_{AB} + d_{BD} + d_{DC}, d_{AC} + d_{CB} + d_{BD}, d_{AC} + d_{CD} + d_{DB}, d_{AD} + d_{DB} + d_{BC}, d_{AD} + d_{DC} + d_{CB}, d_{BA} + d_{AC} + d_{CD}, d_{BA} + d_{AD} + d_{DC}, d_{BC} + d_{CA} + d_{AD}, d_{BC} + d_{CD} + d_{DA}, d_{BD} + d_{DA} + d_{AC}, d_{BD} + d_{DC} + d_{CA}, d_{CA} + d_{AB} + d_{BD}, d_{CA} + d_{AD} + d_{DB}, d_{CB} + d_{BA} + d_{AD}, d_{CB} + d_{BD} + d_{DA}, d_{CD} + d_{DA} + d_{AB}, d_{CD} + d_{DB} + d_{BA}, d_{DA} + d_{AB} + d_{BC}, d_{DA} + d_{AC} + d_{CB}, d_{DB} + d_{BA} + d_{AC}, d_{DB} + d_{BC} + d_{CA}, d_{DC} + d_{CA} + d_{AB}, d_{DC} + d_{CB} + d_{BA})']",13,"[13, '13']",False
