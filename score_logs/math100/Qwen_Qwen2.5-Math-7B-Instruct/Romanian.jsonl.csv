"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of arrangements without any restrictions:**
   For \( n \) people sitting around a round table, the number of distinct arrangements is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 8 \), so the total number of arrangements is:
   \[
   (8-1)! = 7! = 5040
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:**
   If Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 people) around a round table. The number of ways to arrange 6 blocks around a round table is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\). Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3! = 6\) ways. Therefore, the total number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is:
   \[
   5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other:**
   This is the total number of arrangements without any restrictions minus the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:
   \[
   5040 - 720 = 4320
   \]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other is \(\boxed{5760}\).","[5760, '5760']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
\text{Exponent of } x = 3(5-k) + (-2)k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

Setting the exponent of \(x\) to zero, we get:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k \implies k = 3
\]

So, the constant term corresponds to \(k = 3\). Substituting \(k = 3\) into the general term \(T_k\), we get:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the term:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 \cdot x^{-6}
\]

The \(x^6\) and \(x^{-6}\) terms cancel each other out, leaving:

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^2 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot -\frac{1}{8} = 10 \cdot -12.5 = -125

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, multiply the numbers:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

So,

\[
24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To determine the minimum number of degrees by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its initial position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the pentagon.

The angle of rotation for each symmetry of the pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that the pentagon will coincide with its initial position after a rotation of 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, and a full rotation of 360 degrees. The smallest positive rotation that will make the pentagon coincide with its initial position is 72 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees with which the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its initial position is:

"Given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\). We will use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\). The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the midpoints are the same, we set the coordinates equal to each other:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, the midpoint of \(AC\) is not the same as the midpoint of \(BD\). Let's consider the other possibility where \(D\) is the vertex such that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel and equal.

The vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\) is:
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
\]

Since \(AB\) is parallel to \(CD\), the vector \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) is also \((1, 5)\). Therefore, we can find the coordinates of \(D\) by adding the vector \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) to the coordinates of \(C\):
\[
D = C + \overrightarrow{CD} = (7, 4) + (1, 5) = (8, 9)
\]

Here, \(x = 8\) and \(y = 9\), and \(x > 7\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}\), we need to analyze the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0\]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[(x - 7)(x + 2) = 0\]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2\]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). So, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. For the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}\), the degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). So, \(c = 0\).

### Step 3: Calculate \(a + b + c\)
Now, we add the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of matrices, we have

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| \le \sqrt{\text{tr}(A^T A)} = \sqrt{4 + 13} = \sqrt{17}.
\]

To check if this bound is achievable, we need to find a vector \(\bold{v}\) such that \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{17}\). This occurs when \(\bold{v}\) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 17\), but since \( A^T A \) does not have an eigenvalue of 17, we need to check the maximum value of the expression directly. By symmetry and the properties of the matrix, the maximum value is indeed \(\sqrt{17}\).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

2. Două treeks și un goolee sunt egale în greutate cu un squig. This translates to the equation:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

We need to find the weight of four treeks in terms of the weight of one squig. First, let's solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
4t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
4t = 4s - 2t
\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( t \) on one side:
\[
6t = 4s
\]
Divide both sides by 2 to simplify:
\[
3t = 2s
\]
Solve for \( t \) in terms of \( s \):
\[
t = \frac{2s}{3}
\]

Now, we need to find the weight of four treeks:
\[
4t = 4 \left( \frac{2s}{3} \right) = \frac{8s}{3}
\]

Therefore, the weight of four treeks is equal to the weight of \(\frac{8}{3}\) squigs. The final answer is:

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by multiplying the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The product is given by:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will expand this product by distributing each term in the first polynomial to each term in the second polynomial:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Simplifying each term, we get:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expression is equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. For \(t^4\): \(12 = 12\)
2. For \(t^3\): \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. For \(t^2\): \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. For \(t\): \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. For the constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the equation for \(t^3\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical reservoir, we start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We know that the reservoir is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the level of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is equal to the rate at which the reservoir is being filled:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the volume with respect to time can also be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) and the area of the base of the cylinder:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per hour. Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the reservoir is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
The quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), the function \(ax^2\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 2: Analyze the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
The linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a straight line with slope \(a\). For \(x < a\), the value of \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left. If \(a > 0\), the function \(ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) or \(+\infty\). Since the function increases without bound in both regions if \(a > 0\) or decreases without bound if \(a < 0\), the only way for the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once is if the minimum value of \(f(x)\) is finite and the function can take on all values greater than or equal to this minimum value.

The minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\) and is \(a^3\). For the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once, \(a^3\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) or \(+\infty\). Since the function increases without bound in both regions if \(a > 0\) or decreases without bound if \(a < 0\), the only way for the function to intersect each horizontal line at least once is if \(a^3\) is less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\) or \(+\infty\).

### Step 4: Determine the largest value of \(a\)
The function \(f(x)\) will intersect each horizontal line at least once if \(a^3 \leq 0\). This inequality is satisfied if \(a \leq 0\). The largest value of \(a\) that satisfies this inequality is \(a = 0\).

However, if \(a = 0\), the function becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\
0 & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]
This function is simply the constant function \(f(x) = 0\), which intersects each horizontal line only at \(y = 0\). Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms separately.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the radius \( r \) is given by \( r^2 = 34 - c \). We know that the radius is 1, so we set \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for solutions where \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation.

By the factor theorem, since \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a root, we can factor out \((x - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda})\). Using polynomial division or synthetic division, we can divide \(-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1\) by \(x - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

After performing the division, we find that the quotient is a quadratic polynomial. For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), the quadratic polynomial must have real roots in the interval \([0,1]\).

By analyzing the quadratic polynomial, we find that it has real roots in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2\), and we can verify that \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a solution \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) such that \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2}\) is not true. Therefore, we need to recheck the conditions.

Finally, we find that the correct value is \(\lambda = 2\).

Thus, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the angle subtraction formulas \(\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\), we get:

\[
\frac{\cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{1}{2} \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{3}{2} \sin 5^\circ}{-\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{2}}{\frac{-\cos 5^\circ - \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{-\cos 5^\circ - \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ}.
\]

This expression is the negative of the tangent of an angle, and we recognize that:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = \tan(60^\circ + 5^\circ) = \tan 65^\circ.

Therefore, we have:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \le y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \]
\[ f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), respectively. Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Now, we consider the interior of the region where \( -1 < x < 1 \) and \( -1 < y < 1 \). To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \]
From \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \), we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]
This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta \le 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \]
Thus, on the boundary of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1.

\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

\[

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We know that the golden ratio satisfies the equation \(\phi^2 = \phi + 1\). To find \(z\), we can express \(z\) in polar form. Let \(z = re^{i\theta}\). Then \(\frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r}e^{-i\theta}\). Since \(z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi\) is a real number, \(r\) must be 1 (otherwise the imaginary parts would not cancel out). Thus, \(z = e^{i\theta}\) and \(\frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta}\). This gives us:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta\), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Therefore,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Thus, \(z\) can be either \(e^{i\pi/5}\) or \(e^{-i\pi/5}\).

We need to find \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\). If \(z = e^{i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \(z = e^{-i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \(z^{85} = -1\), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangle to the full height of the triangle. Since \(G\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(EBC\) with a similarity ratio equal to the ratio of the distances from \(G\) to \(BC\) to the full height from \(E\) to \(BC\). The height from \(E\) to \(BC\) is the same as the height from \(A\) to \(BC\), and since \(G\) divides the median \(BE\) in the ratio 2:1, the height from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the height from \(E\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangles \(ENG\) to \(EBC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(EBC\). Since \(EBC\) is half of triangle \(ABC\) (because \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\)), the area of triangle \(EBC\) is:
\[

Therefore, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is:

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

- Let \( y \) be the number of 5-cent coins.

We know two things:

We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the prime numbers 2, 3, and 5, there is one even number (2) and two odd numbers (3, 5).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since there are 3 choices for each, the total number of outcomes is:

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must be composed of the digit 1 in positions that correspond to these factors.

1. The factor of 2 requires the number to end in 0.
2. The two factors of 5 require the number to end in 00.
3. The two factors of 3 require the sum of the digits to be a multiple of 3.

Given that the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of the digits must be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, we need to find the smallest number of 1's that is a multiple of 3. The smallest such number is 3.

Next, we calculate the probability that the pion will be placed on a shaded square. The probability is the number of favorable outcomes (shaded squares) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (all squares on the chessboard).

The total number of possible outcomes is the number of possible values for the first number (3) times the number of possible values for the second number (4):

\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.
\]

Thus, the value of the given expression is:

"To determine the form described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

To confirm this, let's consider the following:
- For any point \((r, \theta, z)\) on this plane, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).
- This means that the plane extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(c\).

Therefore, the form described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

The correct answer is \(\boxed{\text{C}}\).","[C, '\\text{C}']",\text{(C)},[],True
"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, the answer is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by determining the sum of the roots of the original function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \).

For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by the formula:
\[
-\frac{a_2}{a_3}
\]
In our case, \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -49 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Next, we need to find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). Let \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) be the roots of \( f(x) \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15
\]
Since \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \), we have:
\[
49 - 15 = 34

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

Let \(t = \tan 20^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as:

\[
(t - \sqrt{3})(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1) = 0.
\]

The roots are \(t = \sqrt{3}\) and the roots of \(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\) with \(a = 1\), \(b = -2\sqrt{3}\), and \(c = -1\), we get:

\[
t = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{16}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm 4}{2} = \sqrt{3} \pm 2.
\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ\) is positive and less than \(\sqrt{3}\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 2} = -(\sqrt{3} + 2)\).

Similarly, we can find that \(\tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} + 2\) and \(\cot 40^\circ = \frac{1}{-\sqrt{3} + 2} = \sqrt{3} + 2\).

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + (-\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 + (\sqrt{3} + 2)^2.
\]

Since \(\tan 10^\circ = \cot 80^\circ\) and \(\cot 80^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 10^\circ = 3\tan^2 10^\circ.
\]

However, we need to use the identity \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the missing interior angle. Therefore, the total sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A
   \]

3. **Relate the total sum to the formula:**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we have:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve for \(A\):**
   Rearrange the equation to isolate \(A\):
   \[
   A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine the range of \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < A < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Set up inequalities:**
   Substitute \(A\) into the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve the inequalities:**
   First, solve \(0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ\):
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve \((n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

8. **Combine the results:**
   From both inequalities, we have:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, \(n = 8\).

Thus, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. This means that:

\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding and rearranging the congruence, we get:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. This means we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test the integers from 1 to 22 to find \( x \):

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the expression for \( t \), we get:

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6
\]

Since \( t \) must be a positive integer less than 23, we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). However, we need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd. Since 4 is even, we need to re-eate our assumption that \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \) and recheck our work.

\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic inch, so we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \]
So, the side length of the cube is 1 inch.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found, we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \]
So, the area of one face of the cube is 1 square inch.

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \]
So, the total surface area of the cube is 6 square inches.

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[

This gives us the possible integer values for \(x\): \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). There are 9 such values.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with base \(CD = c\) and height \(AC = d\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are proportional to their bases \(BC\) and \(AD\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

Let \(k = \frac{b}{a}\). Then:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = k \times [\triangle ACD]
\]

The total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = k \times [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ACD] = (k + 1) \times [\triangle ACD]
\]

Given that the total area is 42, we have:
\[
(k + 1) \times [\triangle ACD] = 42
\]

From the proportionality of the areas, we also know:
\[
k = \frac{b}{a} = \frac{h - d}{d} = \frac{h}{d} - 1
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(d\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\), and \(h\) is the height from \(B\) to \(AD\). Therefore, \(h = d\). This implies:
\[
k = \frac{d}{d} - 1 = 1

Thus, \(k = 1\), and:

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

First, let's substitute the values into the formula:

Next, we perform the multiplication of the integers:

Now, we need to multiply 70 by \(\frac{21}{30}\):
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}

We can simplify the multiplication by canceling out the common factor between 70 and 30. The greatest common divisor of 70 and 30 is 10. Therefore, we can rewrite 70 as \(7 \cdot 10\) and 30 as \(3 \cdot 10\):

"To determine the probability that two randomly chosen segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) on a circle intersect, we can use geometric probability. Here is a step-by-step solution:

1. ** parameterize the points:**
   Consider the circle to be the unit circle in the complex plane. Let the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) be represented by complex numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\) on the unit circle. Since they are chosen randomly and independently, we can assume without loss of generality that they are in clockwise order.

2. ** condition for intersection:**
   Two segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect if and only if the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are arranged such that \(A\) and \(B\) are separated by \(C\) and \(D\) when moving clockwise. This can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Re}(\overline{a}b) + \text{Re}(\overline{c}d) < 1
   \]
   where \(\overline{a}\) and \(\overline{b}\) are the complex conjugates of \(a\) and \(b\), respectively.

3. ** simplify the condition:**
   Since \(a\) and \(b\) lie on the unit circle, \(\overline{a} = \frac{1}{a}\) and \(\overline{b} = \frac{1}{b}\). Therefore, the condition becomes:
   \[
   \text{Re}\left(\frac{b}{a}\right) + \text{Re}\left(\frac{d}{c}\right) < 1
   \]

4. ** geometric interpretation:**
   The real part of \(\frac{b}{a}\) is \(\cos(\theta_B - \theta_A)\), where \(\theta_A\) and \(\theta_B\) are the angles corresponding to points \(A\) and \(B\) on the unit circle. Similarly, \(\text{Re}\left(\frac{d}{c}\right) = \cos(\theta_D - \theta_C)\).

   Thus, the condition for intersection is:
   \[
   \cos(\theta_B - \theta_A) + \cos(\theta_D - \theta_C) < 1
   \]

5. ** probability calculation:**
   To find the probability, we need to consider the uniform distribution of the points on the circle. The angles \(\theta_A\), \(\theta_B\), \(\theta_C\), and \(\theta_D\) are uniformly distributed between \(0\) and \(2\pi\).

   We can use symmetry and combinatorial arguments to simplify the problem. Consider the circle divided into four equal arcs by the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

   Therefore, the probability that \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is:

1. **Calculate the area of the larger circle:**
   The radius of the larger circle is \(2\).
   \[
   \text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
   \]

2. **Determine the area of the shaded region:**
   The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.
   \[
   \text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]

3. **Express the area of the shaded region in terms of the angles:**
   The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the larger circle and one from the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians.

   - **Area of the segment in the larger circle:**
     The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta
     \]
     The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
     \]
     Therefore, the area of the segment in the larger circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the segment in the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
     \]

   - **Area of the segment in the smaller circle:**
     The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
     \]
     The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
     \]
     Therefore, the area of the segment in the smaller circle is:
     \[
     \text{Area of the segment in the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total area of the shaded region:**
   The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments in both circles:
   \[
   2\theta - 2\sin(\theta) + \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   \left(2\theta + \frac{\theta}{2}\right) - \left(2\sin(\theta) + \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   \frac{5\theta}{2} - \frac{5\sin(\theta)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Factor out \(\frac{5}{2}\):
   \[
   \frac{5}{2}(\theta - \sin(\theta)) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
   \[
   \theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

5. **Solve for \(\theta\):**
   The equation \(\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a transcendental equation and cannot be solved algebraically. However, we can use numerical methods or known values to find the solution. By inspection or using a calculator, we find that:
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
   \]

6. **Convert the angle to degrees:**
   \[
   \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = 120^\circ
   \]

Therefore, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is \(\boxed{120}\).","[120, '120']",120,"[120, '120']",True
"To determine how many cylindrical pahars are needed to fill a spherical reserving, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylinder and the sphere and then find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical pahar. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical pahar, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical reserving. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical reserving, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical pahars are required to fill the spherical reserving. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[
\text{Number of pahars} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical pahars needed to fill the spherical reserving is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100:
\[
\frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{100}

\[
\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to inches per second, we need to follow these steps:

   \]
   So, the bicycle travels 240 inches per minute.

2. **Convert minutes to seconds**: Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide the number of minutes by 60.
   \[
   240 \text{ inches/minute} \div 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 4 \text{ inches/second}

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 republicans and 6 democraths, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republicans or only of democrahs).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of republicans. There are 8 republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of democrahs. There are 6 democrahs, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republicans or only of democrahs) is the sum of the two cases calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[

We are given that this quotient is 24, so we have:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

If \( n = 5 \), the three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \). The product of these integers is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\). However, we only need the product of four specific cosines. To proceed, we use the fact that:

\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

Using the double-angle identity \(\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \cdot 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{-1}{32 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know there exists a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Using the Pythagorean identity \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos 3\theta = 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta

Since \(BC = 2BM = 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} = BC\), we substitute \(BC = 2 \cdot \frac{11}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{22}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}\) into the equation:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{\frac{22}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}}{2}\right)^2 + 1 + \frac{22}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \cos 3\theta = \left(\frac{11}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}\right)^2 + 1 + \frac{22}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \cos 3\theta = \frac{121}{\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} + 1 + \frac{22}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} (4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta)
\]
Since \(\cos \theta = 2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{121}{\cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} + 1 + \frac{22}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} \left(4(2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - 1)^3 - 3(2 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} - 1)\right)

After simplifying, we find that \(\cos \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}\). Therefore, \(BC = \frac{22}{\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}} = 11\sqrt{5}\).

The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:

27 \times (x + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (x + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
x + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
x = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81
\]
Thus, the median of the sequence is:
\[
\boxed{81}

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \pm\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which gives us:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is satisfied for:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the answer is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the number of boys who use the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls who use the bus, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of boys to the number of girls for each class and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of boys and girls who use the bus in each class:

1. **Clase a \(9^{\mathrm{a}}\):**
   - Number of boys who use the bus: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Number of girls who use the bus: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.042\)

2. **Clase a \(10^{\mathrm{a}}\):**
   - Number of boys who use the bus: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Number of girls who use the bus: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.040\)

3. **Clase a \(11^{\mathrm{a}}\):**
   - Number of boys who use the bus: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Number of girls who use the bus: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

4. **Clase a \(12^{\mathrm{a}}\):**
   - Number of boys who use the bus: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Number of girls who use the bus: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Ratio of boys to girls: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.344\)

Now, we compare each ratio to \(1.35\):

- For Clase a \(9^{\mathrm{a}}\): \(1.042\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.042 = 0.308\))
- For Clase a \(10^{\mathrm{a}}\): \(1.040\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.040 = 0.310\))
- For Clase a \(11^{\mathrm{a}}\): \(1.5\) (difference: \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\))
- For Clase a \(12^{\mathrm{a}}\): \(1.344\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.344 = 0.006\))

The smallest difference is \(0.006\), which corresponds to Clase a \(12^{\mathrm{a}}\).

Therefore, the class with the number of boys who use the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of girls who use the bus is \(\boxed{\text{Clase a } 12^{\mathrm{a}}}\).","[12**a*Clasea, '\\text{Clase a } 12^{\\text{a}}']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the different cases for the numerator and determine where the quotient is negative.

**Case 1: \(x \leq -9\) or \(x \geq 9\)**
In this case, the numerator is \((x - 9)(x + 9)\). The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0.\]
We need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals \((-\infty, -9]\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9]\), and \([9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9]\), all factors \((x - 9)\), \((x + 9)\), \(x\), and \((x - 36)\) are negative, so the expression is positive.
- For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative, \((x + 9)\) is positive, \(x\) is negative, and \((x - 36)\) is negative, so the expression is negative.
- For \(x \in (0, 9]\), \((x - 9)\) is negative, \((x + 9)\) is positive, \(x\) is positive, and \((x - 36)\) is negative, so the expression is positive.
- For \(x \in [9, 36)\), \((x - 9)\) is positive, \((x + 9)\) is positive, \(x\) is positive, and \((x - 36)\) is negative, so the expression is negative.
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), all factors \((x - 9)\), \((x + 9)\), \(x\), and \((x - 36)\) are positive, so the expression is positive.

From this analysis, the expression \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \([9, 36)\).

**Case 2: \(-9 < x < 9\)**
In this case, the numerator is \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The inequality becomes:
\[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} < 0.\]
This is equivalent to:
\[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)} > 0.\]
We need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}\) in the intervals \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\).

- For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), the expression is negative (as shown in Case 1).
- For \(x \in (0, 9)\), the expression is positive (as shown in Case 1).

From this analysis, the expression \(\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}\) is positive in the interval \((0, 9)\).

Combining the results from both cases, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:
\[
(-9, 0) \cup [9, 36).
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote:
- \( l \) as the length of the rectangle,
- \( w \) as the width of the rectangle.

The two straight sides of the rectangle have a combined length of \( 2l \). Each semicircle has a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, \( \frac{w}{2} \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \) is given by:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \pi w
\]
Since there are two semicircles, their combined length is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two semicircles:
\[
2l + \pi w = 400
\]

We need to express the area \( A \) of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = l \times w
\]

First, solve the perimeter equation for \( l \):
\[
2l + \pi w = 400
\]
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}
\]

Substitute this expression for \( l \) into the area formula:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w
\]
\[
A = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w
\]
\[
200 - \pi w = 0
\]
\[
\pi w = 200
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2}
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{200}{2}
\]
\[
l = 200 - 100
\]
\[
l = 100
\]

Now, calculate the maximum area \( A \):
\[
A = l \times w
\]
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]

Thus, the maximum possible area of the rectangular field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the opposite side to \(\angle R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
Since \(RT = 5\), we can solve for \(ST\):
\[
ST = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21

Taking the square root of both sides:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Using the definition of sine again:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the opposite side to \(\angle T\) is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. The key property we will use is that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) and the point \(P\) such that the distances from \(P\) to \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) are \(PA = 3\), \(PB = 7\), \(PC = 8\), \(PD = 9\), \(PE = 11\), and \(PF = x\). According to the property mentioned, we have:

\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = \text{constant}
\]

First, we calculate the sum of the squares of the given distances:

\[
PA^2 = 3^2 = 9
\]
\[
PB^2 = 7^2 = 49
\]
\[
PC^2 = 8^2 = 64
\]
\[
PD^2 = 9^2 = 81
\]
\[
PE^2 = 11^2 = 121
\]

Adding these values together, we get:

\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant, we have:

\[
324 + x^2 = \text{constant}
\]

However, we do not need to find the actual value of the constant. Instead, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is the same for any point. Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices must be equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from any other point inside the octahedron to its vertices. Since we are given five of the distances, we can find the sixth distance by solving for \(x\):

\[
x^2 = 324 - (9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121) = 324 - 324 = 0
\]

This calculation is incorrect. instead we use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant. we use the property that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the oct }

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen aruncă mingea de softball with the same force as Jack aruncă mingea de baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each ball, we have:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
- The mass of the softball is \( m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \) g.
- The mass of the baseball is \( m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \) g.

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball is:

"To determine which digits appear in both the base 7 and base 8 representations of the number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
The digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 common digits.

"To determine the number of strângeri de mână at the mixer, we need to analyze the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of people at the mixer:**
   - There are 6 vrăjitoare.
   - There are 10 vrăjitorii.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is \(6 + 10 = 16\).

2. **Understand the condition for giving a hand shake:**
   - Each vrăjitorie will give a hand shake to each other person at the mixer, except to the other vrăjitorie.
   - This means each vrăjitorie will give a hand shake to all the vrăjitoare and all the other vrăjitorii except itself.

3. **Calculate the number of hand shakes each vrăjitorie makes:**
   - Each vrăjitorie will give a hand shake to 6 vrăjitoare.
   - Each vrăjitorie will give a hand shake to \(10 - 1 = 9\) vrăjitorii.
   - Therefore, each vrăjitorie will give a total of \(6 + 9 = 15\) hand shakes.

4. **Calculate the total number of hand shakes:**
   - Since there are 10 vrăjitorii, and each vrăjitorie gives 15 hand shakes, the total number of hand shakes given by the vrăjitorii is \(10 \times 15 = 150\).

5. **Consider the hand shakes given by the vrăjitoare:**
   - Each vrăjitorie will give a hand shake to each of the 10 vrăjitorii.
   - Therefore, each vrăjitorie will give a total of 10 hand shakes.
   - Since there are 6 vrăjitoare, the total number of hand shakes given by the vrăjitoare is \(6 \times 10 = 60\).

6. **Calculate the total number of hand shakes at the mixer:**
   - The total number of hand shakes is the sum of the hand shakes given by the vrăjitorii and the hand shakes given by the vrăjitoare.
   - Therefore, the total number of hand shakes is \(150 + 60 = 210\).

Thus, the number of strângeri de mână at the mixer is \(\boxed{210}\).","[210, '210']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5}

"To determine the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) for the roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we start by using Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Now, we need to find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2\), \(t = 1 + i\), and \(t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

   \[
   3c + r = 1.24
   \]

2. The cost of five creioane and one radieria jumbo is \$1.82:
   \[
   5c + r = 1.82

To find the cost of one creion, we can eliminate \( r \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5c + r) - (3c + r) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
5c + r - 3c - r = 2c
\]
And simplifying the right side, we get:
\[
1.82 - 1.24 = 0.58

So, we have:
\[
2c = 0.58

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

First, we simplify the fraction:
\[

\]

Next, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\). To do this, we can use long division.

1. **Set up the division:**
   \[
   137 \div 500

2. **Since 137 is less than 500, we add a decimal point and a zero to make it 1370:**

3. **Divide 1370 by 500:**
   \[

   Write down 7 and subtract 3500 from 3700:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Without loss of generality, we can set \(a = kb\) where \(k\) is a positive constant.

The vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
- \(B = (\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2})\)
- \(C = (\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)
- \(D = (-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2})\)

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where the distance from a point \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B\) is:
\[
d_B = \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C\) is:
\[
d_C = \sqrt{\left(x - \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D\) is:
\[
d_D = \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y + \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
d_O < d_A, \quad d_O < d_B, \quad d_O < d_C, \quad d_O < d_D
\]

Let's start with the inequality \(d_O < d_A\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{\left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < \left(x + \frac{a}{2}\right)^2 + \left(y - \frac{b}{2}\right)^2
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Dividing by 4:
\[
\frac{a}{4}x - \frac{b}{4}y < -\frac{a^2}{16} - \frac{b^2}{16}
\]

Multiplying by 4:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for \(d_O < d_B\), \(d_O < d_C\), and \(d_O < d_D\):
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{4}
\]

These inequalities describe four lines that intersect at the origin and divide the rectangle into four congruent right triangles. Each triangle has vertices at the origin and the midpoints of the sides of the rectangle.

The area of each triangle is:
\[
\text{Area of one triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{2} \times \frac{b}{2} = \frac{ab}{8}
\]

Since there are four such triangles, the total area of the region where the point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is:
\[
\text{Total area of the region} = 4 \times \frac{ab}{8} = \frac{ab}{2}
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the rectangle} = a \times b
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area of the region}}{\text{Area of the rectangle}} = \frac{\frac{ab}{2}}{ab} = \frac{1}{2}

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how many cents remain after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie convert their earnings into banknotes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

2. **Add the amounts step-by-step:**
   - First, add Linda and Sherry's earnings:
     \[
     27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
     \]
   - Next, add June's earnings to the result:
     \[
     62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

   - Finally, add Connie's earnings to the result:
     \[

   So, the total earnings are \$126.59.

4. **Determine the remaining cents:**
   - The remaining amount after converting to banknotes is the decimal part of the total:

   - Convert the decimal part into cents (since 1 dollar = 100 cents):

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7

To verify that \( n = 7 \) makes the matrix a magic square, we substitute \( n = 7 \) into the matrix and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

Now, let's check the sum of each row:
- First row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

Next, let's check the sum of each column:
- First column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)

Finally, let's check the sum of the two main diagonals:
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

"To determine how many more feet Jim merges than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim covers. Jim merges pe diagonală peste caiul, so we use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2}
\]
where \(l\) is the length and \(w\) is the width of the rectangle. For this problem, \(l = 400\) feet and \(w = 300\) feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet}

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + (-1) + 1 = 1.

   - Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\): Distance = \(c + a + d\)
   - Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\): Distance = \(c + b + d\)
   - Route \(D \to B \to A \to C\): Distance = \(e + a + b\)
   - Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\): Distance = \(e + d + b\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\): Distance = \(f + b + a\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\): Distance = \(f + d + a\)

The shortest distance will be the minimum of all these distances. Without specific values for \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\), \(e\), and \(f\), we cannot determine a numerical answer. However, the method to find the shortest distance is clear.

If we assume the distances are such that \(a = b = c = d = e = f = 1\) (for simplicity), then each route will have a total distance of \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\). Therefore, the shortest distance that can be traveled is:
