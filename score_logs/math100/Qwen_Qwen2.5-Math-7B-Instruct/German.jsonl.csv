"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the result of the rotation is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit at a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 10^2 x^{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6}

\[
= \binom{5}{3} 100 x^6 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) x^{-6}

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}
\]

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{(since } 24 = 7 \cdot 3 + 3\text{)}

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides (which is 5 in this case).

The angle of rotation that brings the pentagon back to its original position is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
This means that rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees, 144 degrees, 216 degrees, 288 degrees, or 360 degrees will result in the pentagon looking exactly the same as it did before the rotation. The smallest positive rotation that achieves this is 72 degrees.

Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \) instead. The midpoint of \( AB \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

The midpoint of \( CD \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of Lagrange multipliers.

Define the function \( f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \) and the constraint \( g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0 \). The gradients are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y) \quad \text{and} \quad \nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Equating the two expressions for \(\lambda\), we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13 \implies \frac{6y}{x} - \frac{6x}{y} = 9 \implies \frac{6y^2 - 6x^2}{xy} = 9 \implies \frac{6(y^2 - x^2)}{xy} = 9 \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). Solving for \( y \) using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \), we get

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
y = 2x \quad \text{and} \quad y = -\frac{1}{2}x.
\]

Substituting \( y = 2x \) into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we get

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Substituting these values into \( f(x, y) \), we get

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

Substituting \( y = -\frac{1}{2}x \) into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), we get

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{1}{2}x \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{1}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies \frac{5}{4}x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Substituting these values into \( f(x, y) \), we get

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot \left( -\frac{2}{5} \right) + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 16, and the operator norm of \( A \) is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.
\]

Thus, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is

\[

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by considering the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[1^n = 1 \text{ for any integer } n.\]

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and give the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**

   For \(58_9\):
   \[
   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   For \(18_9\):
   \[
   18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of a Squig in terms of Treeks. Let's define the weights of the animals as follows:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of a Treek.
- Let \( S \) be the weight of a Squig.
- Let \( G \) be the weight of a Goolee.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. Zehn Treeks weigh so much as three Squigs and one Goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Zwei Treeks and one Goolee weigh the same as one Squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the value of \( S \) in terms of \( T \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
10T = 4S - 2T

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( S \) on one side:
\[
12T = 4S

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( S \):
\[
S = 3T

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. Since the tank is being filled at a constant rate, the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is equal to the flow rate of the water:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the volume can also be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the height \( h \) and the area of the base \( \pi r^2 \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that the height of the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so:

\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Substituting this into the equation for the rate of change of the volume, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). Therefore, for \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, for \(x < a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) if \(a < 0\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the intervals \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) (if \(a > 0\)) or \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) and \((a^3, \infty)\) (if \(a < 0\)) must cover all real numbers. This means that the lower bound of one interval must be less than or equal to the upper bound of the other interval.

**Case 1: \(a > 0\)**
We need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\). Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \((2, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find:
- For \(a \in (0, 2]\), say \(a = 1\), we have \(1(1-2)(1+1) = 1(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\), which is true.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), say \(a = 3\), we have \(3(3-2)(3+1) = 3(1)(4) = 12 > 0\), which is false.
Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(0 < a \leq 2\).

**Case 2: \(a < 0\)**
We need \(a^2 + 2a \leq a^3\). Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \((-1, 0)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find:
- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\), say \(a = -2\), we have \((-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0\), which is false.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), say \(a = -0.5\), we have \((-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0\), which is true.
Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) holds for \(-1 \leq a < 0\).

Combining the results from both cases, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must not be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) when \(f(x) \neq x\).

Let's check the value of \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\):
\[
f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = (\lambda - 1) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
This means \(f\left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), so \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\) for all \(\lambda\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation that are not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots of the cubic equation are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\). Testing \(x = 1\):
\[
-\lambda^4 (1)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(1)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)(1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 - \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^3 - 1.
\]
For \(x = 1\) to be a root, we need \(\lambda^3 - 1 = 0\), which gives \(\lambda = 1\). When \(\lambda = 1\), \(f(x) = x\) for all \(x\), so there is no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\).

For \(x = -1\), since \(x\) must be in \([0,1]\), it is not a valid solution.

For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\), we need to check if it is a root of the cubic equation. However, since \(\lambda\) is in the range \([0,4]\), \(\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\) is not in \([0,1]\) for \(\lambda \neq 1\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions.

By numerical methods or further analysis, we find that the only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 2\). When \(\lambda = 2\), the cubic equation becomes:
\[
-8x^3 + 12x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0.
\]
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm \frac{1}{8}\). Testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8\left(\frac{1}{8}\right) + 12\left(\frac{1}{4}\right) - 6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -1 + 3 - 3 + 3 = 2.
\]
This is not a root. However, by numerical methods, we find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root of the cubic equation when \(\lambda = 2\), and \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point. Therefore, there is no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(\lambda = 2\).

The only value of \(\lambda\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 2\).

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[

\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

We need to find a common angle that simplifies this expression. Notice that:

\[

\]
\[

\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that the word has repeated letters. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{7!}{3!}
\]

Next, we calculate \( 7! \) and \( 3! \):

7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

\[
\frac{5040}{6} = 840
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8
\]
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 1.68 \right\rfloor = 1

\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since all higher powers of 5 will result in terms that are 0, we stop here.

Adding these values together gives the total number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):

"To find the maximal value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its properties.

First, observe that the function is symmetric in \( x \) and \( y \). This means that \( f(x, y) = f(y, x) \). Therefore, we can focus on the region where \( x \le y \) without loss of generality.

Next, we consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 1 \) or \( y = 1 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \]
\[ f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) and \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \) or \( x = 0 \), respectively. Thus, \( f(1, 0) = 1 \) and \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Now, we consider the interior of the region where \( -1 < x < 1 \) and \( -1 < y < 1 \). To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \]
From \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Squaring both sides, we obtain:
\[ 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2} \]
Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - x^2 \), we get:
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2 \]
Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2 \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]
This is the equation of a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta \le 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \]
Thus, on the boundary of the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \), the function \( f(x, y) \) is always equal to 1.

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

We can expand this determinant as follows:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). By the properties of similar triangles, \(\triangle AMN\) is similar to \(\triangle ABC\) and the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the base and from the vertex to the base. Specifically, since \(G\) divides the median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of \(\triangle AMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle   1\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides \(\triangle ABC\) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle AGB\), \(\triangle BGC\), and \(\triangle CGA\) is each \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AGB = \text{Area of } \triangle BGC = \text{Area of } \triangle CGA = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48.
\]

The quadrilateral \(BGCN\) can be divided into \(\triangle BGC\) and \(\triangle BCN\). Since \(\triangle BCN\) is similar to \(\triangle ABC\) with a ratio of \(\frac{2}{3}\) (because \(G\) divides \(CF\) in a 2:1 ratio and \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\)), the area of \(\triangle BCN\) is \(\frac{4}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

However, the area of \(\triangle BCN\) is also the sum of the areas of \(\triangle BGC\) and \(\triangle BCN\), but since \(\triangle BCN\) is the same as \(\triangle AMN\), we need to subtract the area of \(\triangle BGC\) from the area of \(\triangle BCN\) to find the area of \(\triangle BCN\) that is not part of \(\triangle BGC\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BCN = \text{Area of } \triangle BGC + \text{Area of } \triangle BNC = 48 + \text{Area of } \triangle BNC = 64.
\]
Thus, the area of \(\triangle BNC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BNC = 64 - 48 = 16.

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle 1\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle 1 = \text{Area of } \triangle BNC = 16.

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even, we first identify the first six prime numbers. These are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and there are five odd numbers, which are \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

We calculate the probability of each event separately:
1. The probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. The probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

**Step 1: Probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.**

There is only one even number out of six, so the probability that Paul chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\). Similarly, the probability that Jesse chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an even number is:
\[
\frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}
\]

**Step 2: Probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.**

There are five odd numbers out of six, so the probability that Paul chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\). Similarly, the probability that Jesse chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\). Therefore, the probability that both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number is:
\[
\frac{5}{6} \times \frac{5}{6} = \frac{25}{36}
\]

**Step 3: Total probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even.**

The total probability is the sum of the probabilities of the two mutually exclusive events (both choosing an even number and both choosing an odd number):
\[
\frac{1}{36} + \frac{25}{36} = \frac{26}{36} = \frac{13}{18}

Thus, the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by Paul and Jesse is even is \(\boxed{\frac{13}{18}}\).","[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",True
"To find the value of \( b \) when the point \((a, b)\) lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\) and \(a = 4\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \(a = 4\) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\). This will give us an equation in terms of \(b\).
2. Solve the resulting equation for \(b\).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[3(4) + 2b = 12\]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[12 + 2b = 12\]

Now, we need to isolate \(b\). We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[2b = 12 - 12\]
\[2b = 0\]

Finally, we solve for \(b\) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[b = \frac{0}{2}\]
\[b = 0\]

"To determine the total area of the shaded regions, we need to analyze the given diagram step by step.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - The rectangle is formed by 12 unit squares.
   - Since each square has a side length of 1 unit, the dimensions of the rectangle are \(3\) units by \(4\) units.

2. **Analyze the shaded regions:**
   - There are two shaded triangles in the diagram.
   - The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
   - The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

3. **Calculate the area of the first shaded triangle:**
   - The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is \(2\) units.
   - The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is \(4\) units.
   - The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}

     Substituting the values:
     \[

4. **Calculate the area of the second shaded triangle:**
   - The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is \(4\) units.
   - The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is \(3\) units.
   - The area \(A_2\) of a triangle is given by the formula:

5. **Find the total area of the shaded regions:**
   - Add the areas of the two shaded triangles:
     \[
     A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units}

Therefore, the total area of the shaded regions is \(\boxed{10}\).","[10, '10']",10,"[10, '10']",True
"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must end in ""00"".

Next, we need to ensure that the number contains at least one factor of 2. Since the number ends in ""00"", it already contains a factor of 2 (and actually two factors of 2, but we only need one).

Now, we need to ensure that the number contains at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the number must contain at least two 1's (because \(1 + 1 = 2\) and we need the sum to be at least 6 to be divisible by 3).

Combining these requirements, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is ""1100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- It contains two 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, ""1100"" is not a valid solution.

We need to find a larger number. The next smallest number that ends in ""00"" and contains at least two 1's is ""11100"". Let's check:

- It ends in ""00"", so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- It contains three 1's, so the sum of its digits is \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.

Since ""11100"" meets all the criteria, it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that the game stone lands on a shaded square of the chessboard, we need to analyze the possible outcomes of the two dice rolls and the corresponding positions on the chessboard.

First, let's identify the possible remainders when the numbers on the die are divided by 4 and 5:
- When a number is divided by 4, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3.
- When a number is divided by 5, the possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4.

The chessboard has 8 rows and 8 columns, and we need to determine which of these fields are shaded. The fields are shaded if the column number (determined by the remainder when the first die is rolled) is odd and the row number (determined by the remainder when the second die is rolled) is even. The possible odd column numbers are 1 and 3, and the possible even row numbers are 2 and 4.

Now, let's count the number of favorable outcomes:
- There are 2 possible odd column numbers (1 and 3).
- There are 2 possible even row numbers (2 and 4).
- Therefore, the number of favorable outcomes is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

Next, let's count the total number of possible outcomes:
- There are 3 possible remainders for the first die.
- There are 4 possible remainders for the second die.
- Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

The probability that the game stone lands on a shaded field is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:
\[
\frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the probability that the game stone on a shaded field of the chessboard is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Thus, the sum of the digits in the finite decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

"To determine the form described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that every point on the surface has the same \(z\)-coordinate. In other words, the surface is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

Since \(r\) and \(\theta\) can take any value, the surface extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions, forming a flat, two-dimensional plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and located at a height \(c\) above it.

Therefore, the form described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}

The sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the coefficient \( a_3 \) of \( x^3 \) is 1 and the coefficient \( a_2 \) of \( x^2 \) is -49. Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). This is a horizontal shift of the function \( f(x) \) by 5 units to the left. If \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) are the roots of \( f(x) \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15

Since we know that \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

Let \(t = \tan 20^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as:

\[
(t - \sqrt{3})(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1) = 0.
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1 = 0\) are:

\[
t = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm 4}{2} = \sqrt{3} \pm 2.
\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ\) is positive and less than \(\sqrt{3}\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 2} = -\sqrt{3} - 2\).

We also know that \(\tan 10^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\sqrt{3} - 2)} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \sqrt{3} + 2}{1 + 1 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{1 - 3 + 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}}{2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}} = 1\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ = 1\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ = (-\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 = 3 + 4\sqrt{3} + 4 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} - 2)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{1 + 3 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2 - \sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1}\right)^2 = (2 + \sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) = 15 + 8\sqrt{3}\).

Finally, we substitute this back into the expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 15 + 8\sqrt{3} = 18 + 8\sqrt{3}.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum \(S\) of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the total sum \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle is less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\).

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve the lower bound:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve the upper bound:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]
   Add \(1070^\circ\) to both sides:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, we have:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

7. **Combine the results:**
   From the inequalities \(n \geq 8\) and \(n \leq 8\), we conclude:
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the definition of the inverse. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, \( x = t+2 \), so we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\

8^2 &\equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}, \\
9^2 &\equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}, \\
10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned}
\]

From the above, we see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]

Since we are looking for an odd integer, we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = 17 \). We can verify that \( t = 17 \) satisfies the original condition:

\[ t+2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is \(\boxed{17}\).","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True
"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found, we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Since the problem asks for the total surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, the total surface area in square inches is:
\[ S = 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to determine what the radical conjugate is. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

Subtracting these values gives:
\[
25 - 3 = 22

"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

and
\[

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},
\]
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), the height from \(C\) to \(AD\) is \(d\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

We also consider the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AB\), the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d
\]

The total area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times d + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b)
\]

We already know that \((a + b) \times h = 84\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), \(d\) is the height from \(C\) to \(AD\), and thus \(d = h\). Therefore:
\[
(a + b) \times d = 84
\]

Substituting \(d = h\) into the equation for the total area, we get:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times d \times (a + b) = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]

This confirms our setup. Now, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times d
\]

Since \(d = h\) and \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):
\[
h = \frac{84}{a + b}
\]

Substituting \(h\) back into the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times \frac{84}{a + b} = \frac{42b}{a + b}
\]

Since the total area of \(ABCD\) is 42, we have:
\[
\frac{42a}{a + b} + \frac{42b}{a + b} = 42
\]

This equation is always true, confirming our setup. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]

Given that \(a + b = 84\), we need to find the specific values of \(a\) and \(b\) to determine the area. However, since the problem does not provide specific values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of \(ABCD\) when \(a = b\). Given the symmetry and properties of the trapezoid, we can conclude:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\) for \(x\), we will follow these steps:

   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in the order they appear on the circle, they must alternate: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: As mentioned earlier, the favorable arrangements are those where the points alternate. There are 2 such arrangements: \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) and \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Thus, the probability is:

"To determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the shaded region. The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is given by:

\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:

\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

According to the problem, the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:

\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of a sector of the smaller circle and a sector of the larger circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the smaller circle with angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{360}
\]

The area of the sector of the larger circle with angle \(\theta\) is:

\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} \times 4 = \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{\theta \pi}{90}

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two sectors:

\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{\theta \pi}{90} = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{5\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{\theta \pi}{72}

Next, we multiply both sides by 72:

\[

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the beaker and the tank and then find the ratio of the tank's volume to the beaker's volume.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the tank by the volume of one beaker:
\[

"To evaluate the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\), we get:
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},

\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expressions for \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = 0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5 = \frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2} + \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10} + \frac{\sqrt{21}}{10} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10},
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = 0.5 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.4 = \frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5} - \frac{0.4 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{(0.5 - 0.4) \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{0.1 \sqrt{21}}{5} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50}.

Finally, we multiply \(\sin (\alpha + \beta)\) and \(\sin (\beta - \alpha)\):
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = \left( \frac{2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}}{10} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{\sqrt{21}}{50} \right) = \frac{(2 \sqrt{3} + \sqrt{21}) \sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2 \sqrt{3} \cdot \sqrt{21} + \sqrt{21} \cdot \sqrt{21}}{500} = \frac{2 \sqrt{63} + 21}{500} = \frac{2 \cdot 3 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500} = \frac{6 \sqrt{7} + 21}{500}.

This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members of the Senate committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting entirely of Republicans. There are 8 Republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

The number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting entirely of Republicans or entirely of Democrats) is the sum of the two calculations above:

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

The mean of these integers is:

The three consecutive integers are \( -6 \), \( -5 \), and \( -4 \). The product of these integers is:

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\). This polynomial can be derived from the Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{1}{8}\) (by Vieta's formulas). However, we need to consider the product of the cosines of the angles, which is the absolute value of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) divided by 8. Since all the roots are positive, the product of the cosines is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{16}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the height \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) with \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

The point \( D \) is on \( AM \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( DM = 1 \). We need to use the given condition \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]
Since \( BD = CD \) (because \( D \) is on the perpendicular bisector of \( BC \)), we can simplify this to:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - \cos(3\theta))
\]
We know that \( BD = \sqrt{BD^2} = \sqrt{AD^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{100 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} \).

Substituting \( BD \) into the equation, we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2 \left(100 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2\right) (1 - \cos(3\theta))
\]
Simplifying further, we have:
\[
BC^2 = 2 \left(100 + \frac{BC^2}{4}\right) (1 - \cos(3\theta)) = \left(200 + \frac{BC^2}{2}\right) (1 - \cos(3\theta))
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \( \cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta) \), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BC^2 = \left(200 + \frac{BC^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)\right)
\]
Let \( x = BC \). Then the equation becomes:
\[
x^2 = \left(200 + \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)\right)
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
2x^2 = (400 + x^2) (1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta))
\]
Expanding the right side, we have:
\[
2x^2 = 400 - 1600\cos^3(\theta) + 1200\cos(\theta) + x^2 - 4x^2\cos^3(\theta) + 3x^2\cos(\theta)
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^2 = 400 - 1600\cos^3(\theta) + 1200\cos(\theta) - 4x^2\cos^3(\theta) + 3x^2\cos(\theta)
\]
Combining like terms, we have:
\[
x^2 = 400 - 1600\cos^3(\theta) - 4x^2\cos^3(\theta) + 1200\cos(\theta) + 3x^2\cos(\theta)
\]
\[
x^2 = 400 - 1600\cos^3(\theta) - x^2\cos^3(\theta) + 1200\cos(\theta)
\]
\[
x^2 + x^2\cos^3(\theta) = 400 - 1600\cos^3(\theta) + 1200\cos(\theta)
\]
Factoring out \( x^2 \) on the left side, we get:
\[
x^2 (1 + \cos^3(\theta)) = 400 - 1600\cos^3(\theta) + 1200\cos(\theta)
\]
We know from the geometry of the triangle that \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{\frac{BC}{2}}{11} = \frac{x}{22} \). Substituting \( \cos(\theta) = \frac{x}{22} \) into the equation, we get:
\[
x^2 \left(1 + \left(\frac{x}{22}\right)^3\right) = 400 - 1600\left(\frac{x}{22}\right)^3 + 1200\left(\frac{x}{22}\right)
\]
Simplifying the right side, we have:
\[
x^2 \left(1 + \frac{x^3}{10648}\right) = 400 - \frac{1600x^3}{10648} + \frac{1200x}{22}
\]
\[
x^2 \left(1 + \frac{x^3}{10648}\right) = 400 - \frac{200x^3}{1331} + \frac{600x}{11}
\]
Multiplying through by 10648 to clear the denominators, we get:
\[
x^2 (10648 + x^3) = 4259200 - 1600x^3 + 57600x
\]
Expanding the left side, we have:
\[
10648x^2 + x^5 = 4259200 - 1600x^3 + 57600x
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^5 + 1600x^3 + 10648x^2 - 57600x - 4259200 = 0
\]
By trial and error or using numerical methods, we find that \( x = 22 \) is a solution. Therefore, \( BC = 22 \).

The length of \( AB \) and \( AC \) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in \( \triangle ABM \):

The perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{2} + 11\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22\sqrt{2} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{2} + 1)

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it into two parts and solve each part separately.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 > -4\). This inequality is always true for all real \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us the roots:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we need to solve the inequality:
\[0 \leq y < 3.\]
Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:
\[0 \leq x^2 < 3.\]
This inequality is satisfied when:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Combining the solutions from both parts of the original inequality, we get:

\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),

or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,

so
\[
s = 4.

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):

p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus drivers for each class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases}

-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:

   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the running track. The running track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width of the rectangle by \( W \). The two semicircles together form a full circle with a radius equal to the width \( W \) of the rectangle. The circumference of a full circle is given by \( 2\pi W \). Therefore, the total length of the running track can be expressed as:
\[
L + L + 2\pi W = 2L + 2\pi W
\]
We know that this total length is 400 meters, so we can set up the following equation:
\[
2L + 2\pi W = 400
\]
We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 2:
\[
L + \pi W = 200
\]
Next, we solve for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
L = 200 - \pi W
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = (200 - \pi W)W = 200W - \pi W^2
\]
This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( W \), and it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum value of a quadratic function \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \). In our equation, \( a = -\pi \) and \( b = 200 \), so the value of \( W \) that maximizes the area is:
\[
W = -\frac{200}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{200}{2\pi} = \frac{100}{\pi}

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{100}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = 200 - \pi \left( \frac{100}{\pi} \right) = 200 - 100 = 100

Given \( \sin R = \frac{2}{5} \), the side opposite \( \angle R \) is \( ST = 2 \).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \( RS \). We can use the Pythagorean theorem for this purpose. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (\( c \)) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (\( a \) and \( b \)). In \( \triangle RST \), we have:
\[

Substituting the known values:

Now, we need to find \( \sin T \). Recall that \( \sin T \) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite \( \angle T \) to the length of the hypotenuse. In \( \triangle RST \), the side opposite \( \angle T \) is \( RS = \sqrt{21} \) and the hypotenuse is \( RT = 5 \). Therefore:
\[
\sin T = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \( \sin T \) is:

"To find the smallest distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

"To solve for the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the regular octahedron, we start by noting the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. The vertices can be placed in a coordinate system such that the coordinates of the vertices are \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\).

Let's denote the coordinates of point \( P \) as \((x, y, z)\). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex, which we will denote as \( d \).

The distance from \( P \) to a vertex \((a, b, c)\) is given by the formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2}
\]

We can write the equations for the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \((1, 0, 0)\), \((-1, 0, 0)\), \((0, 1, 0)\), \((0, -1, 0)\), \((0, 0, 1)\), and \((0, 0, -1)\) as follows:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2} = d
\]

We square each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 = d^2
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Similarly, we subtract the first equation from the third equation:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - x^2 + 2x - 1 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
-2y + 2x = 55
\]
\[
x - y = \frac{55}{2}
\]

Since \( x = 10 \), we substitute \( x \) into the equation \( x - y = \frac{55}{2} \):
\[
10 - y = \frac{55}{2}
\]
\[
-y = \frac{55}{2} - 10
\]
\[
-y = \frac{55}{2} - \frac{20}{2}
\]
\[
-y = \frac{35}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{35}{2}
\]

Next, we substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( y = -\frac{35}{2} \) into the fourth equation:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
10^2 + \left(-\frac{35}{2} + 1\right)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
100 + \left(-\frac{35}{2} + \frac{2}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
100 + \left(-\frac{33}{2}\right)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
100 + \frac{1089}{4} + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
100 + 272.25 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
372.25 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
z^2 = 81 - 372.25
\]
\[
z^2 = -291.25

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's Softball to Jack's Baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the Softball with the same force as Jack throws the Baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{Softball}} = F_{\text{Baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each ball, we get:

\[ m_{\text{Softball}} \cdot a_{\text{Softball}} = m_{\text{Baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{Baseball}} \]

We know the masses of the balls:
- The mass of the Softball, \( m_{\text{Softball}} \), is 200 g.
- The mass of the Baseball, \( m_{\text{Baseball}} \), is 150 g.

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{Softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{Baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the Softball to the acceleration of the Baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{Softball}}}{a_{\text{Baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Softball}}}{a_{\text{Baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's Softball to Jack's Baseball is:

\[

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base-7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base-8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Counting these, we find there are 3 common digits.

"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred at the meeting, we need to consider the handshakes between the Hexen and the Zauberer. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of Hexen and Zauberer:**
   - There are 6 Hexen.
   - There are 10 Zauberer.

2. **Determine the handshakes between Hexen and Zauberer:**
   - Each Hexen shakes hands with each Zauberer.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes between Hexen and Zauberer is calculated by multiplying the number of Hexen by the number of Zauberer:
     \[
     6 \text{ Hexen} \times 10 \text{ Zauberer} = 60 \text{ handshakes}

3. **Consider the handshakes among Hexen and among Zauberer:**
   - According to the problem, no Hexen shakes hands with another Hexen.
   - No Zauberer shakes hands with another Zauberer.
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes among Hexen is 0.
   - The number of handshakes among Zauberer is 0.

4. **Calculate the total number of handshakes:**
   - The total number of handshakes is the sum of the handshakes between Hexen and Zauberer, plus the handshakes among Hexen, plus the handshakes among Zauberer:
     \[
     60 \text{ handshakes} + 0 \text{ handshakes} + 0 \text{ handshakes} = 60 \text{ handshakes}

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

Therefore, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2 \sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

We also know that:

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Now, we need to find the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\), which simplifies to:

\[
t^3 + 4t = 0.

Factoring out \(t\), we get:

\[
t(t^2 + 4) = 0.

"To determine the cost of one Bleistift, we can set up a system of linear equations based on the given information. Let's define the variables:
- \( x \) as the cost of one Bleistift in dollars.
- \( y \) as the cost of one Jumbo-Radicircle in dollars.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. \( 3x + y = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5x + y = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5x + y) - (3x + y) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 5x + y - 3x - y = 0.58 \]
\[ 2x = 0.58 \]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ x = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ x = 0.29 \]

The cost of one Bleistift is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

First, we simplify the fraction by performing the division:

\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

We can convert this fraction into a decimal by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a power of 10 to make the denominator a power of 10. Notice that:

\[
500 = 5 \times 100
\]

We need to multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 2 to make the denominator \(1000\):

\[
\frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000}

Now, we can write \(\frac{274}{1000}\) as a decimal:

\[
\frac{274}{1000} = 0.274

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to a vertex, say \(A(-a/2, b/2)\), is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a/2)^2 + (y - b/2)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < ax + \frac{a^2}{4} - by + \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2}{4} - \frac{b^2}{4}
\]

Factoring out \(-\frac{1}{4}\) on the right-hand side:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{1}{4}(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Multiplying through by \(-4\) (and reversing the inequality):
\[
-4ax + 4by > a^2 + b^2
\]

Dividing through by \(a^2 + b^2\):
\[
\frac{-4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} > 1
\]

This inequality represents a line in the coordinate plane. Similarly, we can derive inequalities for the other three vertices. The lines will form a smaller rectangle inside \(ABCD\) where each point is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex.

The vertices of this smaller rectangle are found by solving the system of inequalities:
\[
\frac{-4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{-4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{4by}{a^2 + b^2} = -1
\]
\[
\frac{4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{-4by}{a^2 + b^2} = 1
\]
\[
\frac{4ax}{a^2 + b^2} + \frac{-4by}{a^2 + b^2} = -1
\]

Solving these, we find the coordinates of the vertices of the smaller rectangle:
\[
\left( \pm \frac{a}{2k+2}, \pm \frac{b}{2k+2} \right)
\]

The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are:
\[

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:

   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

2. **Convert the total amount into cents:**

   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}

3. **Determine how many dimes can be converted into sheets:**
   Each sheet contains 10 dimes, and each dime is worth 10 cents. Therefore, each sheet is worth:
   \[
   10 \times 10 = 100 \text{ cents}

   To find out how many sheets they can convert, we divide the total number of cents by the value of each sheet:

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6

Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:

Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[

Here, the length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. So, the distance Jim travels is:

The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
