"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying this equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( z \) is rotated \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Substituting \( z' = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \):
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i

   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Substituting \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \):
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can be seated at a table such that 3 specific people (Pierre, Rose, and Tom) are not seated next to each other, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, calculate the total number of ways to arrange 8 people around a circular table. For a circular arrangement, we fix one person in one position to avoid counting rotations as different arrangements. So, we arrange the remaining 7 people in the remaining 7 seats. This can be done in \(7!\) (7 factorial) ways.
\[
7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rose, and Tom are seated next to each other. We can treat Pierre, Rose, and Tom as a single ""block"" or ""super person"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""people"" (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. Again, we fix one of these 6 ""people"" in one position, so we arrange the remaining 5 ""people"" in the remaining 5 seats. This can be done in \(5!\) ways. Within the block, Pierre, Rose, and Tom can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways.
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]
So, the number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rose, and Tom are seated next to each other is:
\[
5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
\]

Now, we subtract the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rose, and Tom are seated next to each other from the total number of arrangements to get the number of arrangements where they are not seated next to each other.
\[
5040 - 720 = 4320

Therefore, the number of ways 8 people can be seated at a table such that Pierre, Rose, and Tom are not seated next to each other is \(\boxed{5040}\).","[5040, '5040']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"为了找到 \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) 的展开式中的常数项，我们将使用二项式定理。二项式定理表明：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k

我们需要找到 \(k\) 的值，使得项 \(T_k\) 是常数。为了使项成为常数，\(x\) 的指数必须为零。让我们确定 \(T_k\) 中 \(x\) 的指数：

\[

\[

为了使项成为常数，我们将指数设为零：

\[

解 \(k\)：

简化每一部分：

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10

\[

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression modulo 7:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplifying the terms inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
(2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}, \quad (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}, \quad (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Since \( 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \), we can substitute 1 for 8:

\[
(2 + 6) \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we substitute these values back into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, we calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[

We need to find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of a regular pentagon and the effect of rotating it around its center.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal interior angles. When we rotate a regular pentagon around its center, it will look the same after every 72 degrees of rotation because 360 degrees divided by 5 is 72 degrees. This means that the pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5.

If we rotate the pentagon by 72 degrees, it will look the same as it did before the rotation. Therefore, after rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees, each vertex will move to the position of the next vertex in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

To find out how many degrees we need to rotate the pentagon so that each vertex moves to the position of the vertex that is two places away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction, we need to consider the following:

If we rotate the pentagon by 144 degrees, each vertex will move to the position of the vertex that is two places away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. This is because 144 degrees is equivalent to two 72-degree rotations. So, after rotating the pentagon by 144 degrees, the pentagon will look the same as it did before the rotation, but each vertex will have moved to the position of the vertex that is two places away.

Therefore, the number of degrees we need to rotate the pentagon so that each vertex moves to the position of the vertex that is two places away in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction is \(\boxed{144}\).","[144, '144']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"为了确定点 \((x, y)\) 的坐标，使得点 \((5, 3)\)，\((6, 8)\)，\((7, 4)\)，和 \((x, y)\) 形成一个平行四边形，我们需要使用平行四边形的性质，即对角线互相平分。这意味着连接对角线中点的线段长度相等。

首先，我们找到对角线 \((5, 3)\) 和 \((x, y)\) 的中点。对角线 \((5, 3)\) 和 \((x, y)\) 的中点由下式给出：
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

接下来，我们找到对角线 \((6, 8)\) 和 \((7, 4)\) 的中点。对角线 \((6, 8)\) 和 \((7, 4)\) 的中点由下式给出：
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

由于对角线互相平分，对角线中点的坐标必须相等。因此，我们将中点的坐标设置为相等：
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

这给出了我们两个方程：
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{和} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

解第一个方程求 \(x\)：
\[

解第二个方程求 \(y\)：
\[

"To determine the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) can be factored as:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but with a slight modification. The binomial square formula is \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). If we compare \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) to \((a + b)^2\), we can see that it is similar to \((a + b)^2\) but with \(2ab\) replaced by \(ab\). However, we can use a different approach by recognizing a pattern in the expression.

Let's try to factor \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) by considering it as a polynomial in terms of \(x\):
\[x^2 + x + 1.\]

We know that \(x^2 + x + 1\) can be factored using complex numbers, but for our purposes, we can use a different approach. Let's try to find a pattern by considering the expression in a different form.

Notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

This is a known algebraic identity. To verify, we can expand the right-hand side:
\[\frac{100^3 - 1}{99} = \frac{(100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99} = \frac{99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99} = 100^2 + 100 + 1.\]

So, we have:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 100^2 + 100 + 1.\]

Now, we can calculate \(100^2 + 100 + 1\):
\[100^2 = 10000,\]
\[10000 + 100 = 10100,\]
\[10100 + 1 = 10101.\]

"To find the smallest constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for every vector \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

First, let's express \( A \bold{v} \) for a general vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\):

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we need to find the norm of \( A \bold{v} \):

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We want to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is given by

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) \le (4 + 12 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 29.
\]

Thus,

\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le \sqrt{29}.
\]

To check if this bound is achievable, we need to find a vector \(\bold{v}\) such that \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{29}\). This occurs when the vector \(\bold{v}\) is in the direction of the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 29\). However, we can also check specific values. For example, if we take \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\), then

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = 2.
\]

If we take \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), then

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{13}.
\]

If we take \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), then

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} \quad \text{and} \quad \left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{25 + 4} = \sqrt{29}.

     18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}
     \]

2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10:**
   - Now that we have the base 10 equivalents, we can subtract them:
     \[
     53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
     \]

3. **Convert the result back to base 9:**
   - To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to determine the coefficients of the powers of 9. We start by finding the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36. The powers of 9 are \(9^0 = 1\), \(9^1 = 9\), and \(9^2 = 81\). Since \(9^2 = 81\) is greater than 36, we use \(9^1\) and \(9^0\).
   - We divide 36 by 9 to find the coefficient of \(9^1\):
     \[
     36 \div 9 = 4
     \]
     So, the coefficient of \(9^1\) is 4, and we have:
     \[
     36_{10} = 4 \cdot 9^1 + 0 \cdot 9^0 = 40_9
     \]

Therefore, the answer is \(\boxed{40_9}\).","[40, '40_9']",40_9,"[40, '40']",True
"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}
\]","[cot(x), '\\cot x']",\cot x,[],True
"To determine how many trouts are equivalent to one eel's weight, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. ** Information Analysis:**
   - 10 trouts + 3 eels = 1 gecko
   - 2 trouts + 1 eel = 1 fish

2. ** Express Geckos in Terms of Trouts and Eels:**
   From the first equation:
   \[
   10 \text{ trouts} + 3 \text{ eels} = 1 \text{ gecko}

4. ** Determine the Weight of One Fish in Trouts:**

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial and then combine like terms.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \(a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, combine all these products:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, combine the like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]
This is always true.

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
Solve for \(b\):
\[
3b = 26 - 20
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]
Substitute \(b = 2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4a = -8
\]
\[
-6 + 10 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4 + 4a = -8
\]
\[
4a = -8 - 4
\]
\[
4a = -12
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -16
\]
\[
-10 - 6 = -16
\]
\[
-16 = -16
\]
This is always true.

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
Substitute \(a = -3\):
\[
-2(-3) = 6
\]
\[
6 = 6
\]
This is always true.

We have found \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b\) is:
\[

"To determine the diameter of the cylindrical tank, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the rate of change of the volume of water in the tank:**
   The tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per minute.

2. **Determine the rate of change of the height of the water:**
   The height of the water is increasing at a rate of 0.1 meters per minute.

3. **Relate the volume of the cylinder to its radius and height:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height.

4. **Differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):**
   Using the chain rule, we get:
   \[
   \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
   \]

5. **Substitute the known rates into the differentiated equation:**
   We know \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 0.1\). Substituting these values in, we get:
   \[
   20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 0.1
   \]

6. **Solve for \(r^2\):**
   Divide both sides of the equation by \(\pi\):
   \[
   20 = r^2 \cdot 0.1
   \]
   Then, divide both sides by 0.1:
   \[
   r^2 = \frac{20}{0.1} = 200

7. **Solve for \(r\):**
   Take the square root of both sides:
   \[
   r = \sqrt{200} = 10\sqrt{2}

8. **Determine the diameter:**
   The diameter \(d\) is twice the radius:

"To determine the largest possible value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) does not intersect the line \(y = x + 2\) at any point, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) in two cases: \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

**Case 1: \(x \geq a\)**

For \(x \geq a\), the function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). We need to find the condition under which the equation \(ax^2 = x + 2\) has no real solutions. Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ax^2 - x - 2 = 0.\]
This is a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) with \(a = a\), \(b = -1\), and \(c = -2\). The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
\[\Delta = b^2 - 4ac.\]
Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), we get:
\[\Delta = (-1)^2 - 4(a)(-2) = 1 + 8a.\]
For the quadratic equation to have no real solutions, the discriminant must be less than zero:
\[1 + 8a < 0.\]
Solving for \(a\), we get:
\[8a < -1 \implies a < -\frac{1}{8}.\]

**Case 2: \(x < a\)**

For \(x < a\), the function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). We need to find the condition under which the equation \(ax + 2a = x + 2\) has no real solutions. Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ax - x = 2 - 2a \implies (a-1)x = 2(1 - a).\]
If \(a \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(a-1\):
\[x = \frac{2(1 - a)}{a - 1} = -2.\]
For the equation to have no real solutions, \(x\) must not be less than \(a\). Therefore, we need:
\[-2 \geq a \implies a \leq -2.\]

Combining the conditions from both cases, we get:
\[a < -\frac{1}{8} \quad \text{and} \quad a \leq -2.\]
The most restrictive condition is \(a \leq -2\). Therefore, the largest possible value of \(a\) is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with a diameter of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form of a circle's equation, where the radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]

We know that the diameter of the circle is 1, so the radius \( r \) is half of the diameter:
\[ r = \frac{1}{2} \]

Substitute \( r = \frac{1}{2} \) into the equation \( r^2 = 34 - c \):
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = 34 - c \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(x \in [0,1]\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) cannot be 0 or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\). We start by computing \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to be equal to \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Assuming \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a root of \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a root of \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 \right] = 0.
\]
For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2 - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
0 + 0 - 2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2}.
\]
We need to check if \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\) satisfies the condition \(f(f(x)) = x\) and \(f(x) \neq x\). For \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\), we have:
\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2} x (1 - x) = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2},
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f\left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right)\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(1 - \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x^2}{2}\right).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
f(f(x)) = \frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x}{2} - \frac{x^2}{2}\right) \left(\frac{2 - x + x^2}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4} (x - x^2)(2 - x + x^2) = \frac{1}{4} (2x - x^2 - 2x^2 + x^3 + 2x^2 - x^4) = \frac{1}{4} (2x - x^2 + x^3 - x^4) = x.
\]
Thus, \(f(f(x)) = x\) for \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\) and \(f(x) \neq x\) for \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{1}{2}\). Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is:

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
We can use the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) to rewrite the expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression \(\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}\) can be rewritten using the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin(90^\circ - 5^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.

Therefore, we have:

"To determine the number of different ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" such that the vowels (E, I, E) appear in the odd positions, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the positions of the vowels and consonants in the word ""ELLIPSE"". The word has 8 letters, so the odd positions are 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the even positions are 2, 4, 6, and 8. Since we have 3 vowels (E, I, E) and 5 consonants (L, L, P, S, E), we need to place the vowels in the odd positions and the consonants in the even positions.

2. Calculate the number of ways to arrange the vowels in the odd positions. We have 4 odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7) and 3 vowels (E, I, E). The number of distinct arrangements of these vowels is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]
   Here, \(4!\) is the factorial of 4 (which is 24), and \(2!\) is the factorial of 2 (which is 2), accounting for the repetition of the letter E.

3. Calculate the number of ways to arrange the consonants in the even positions. We have 4 even positions (2, 4, 6, 8) and 5 consonants (L, L, P, S, E). The number of distinct arrangements of these consonants is given by the formula for permutations of a multiset:
   \[

   Here, \(5!\) is the factorial of 5 (which is 120), and \(2!\) is the factorial of 2 (which is 2), accounting for the repetition of the letter L.

4. Multiply the number of ways to arrange the vowels by the number of ways to arrange the consonants to get the total number of distinct arrangements:

Therefore, the number of different ways to arrange the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" such that the vowels appear in the odd positions is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",1260,"[1260, '1260']",False
"要 determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\) and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior at the boundary points and within the domain.

First, let's check the function at the boundary points. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into the function \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]
Substituting \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into the function \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points in the interior of the domain that could give a value greater than 1. However, since the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric and the maximum value on the boundary is 1, and the function is continuous, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) in the entire domain must be 1.

Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[ z^2 - \left( \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \right)z + 1 = 0. \]

Using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \) with \( a = 1 \), \( b = -\frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), and \( c = 1 \), we get:

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( z \) can be expressed in polar form. Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = 2 \cos \theta \) and \( \phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we have \( 2 \cos \theta = \phi \), so \( \cos \theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4} \). The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this is \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{5} \) (or \( \theta = -\frac{\pi}{5} \)). Therefore, \( z \) can be written as:

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left( e^{i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{i \cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i \cdot 17\pi} = e^{i \cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i \cdot 16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i \cdot 2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left( e^{-i\pi/5} \right)^{85} = e^{-i \cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i \cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i \cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i \cdot 16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i \cdot 2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

The line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the median \(AD\) into a ratio of 2:1, meaning \(AG = 2GD\). This implies that triangle \(AGN\) is similar to triangle \(ADC\) with a similarity ratio of 2:3. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AGN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ADC\).

Since \(G\) divides \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1, the area of triangle \(AGD\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ADC\).

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3}Bh \]

where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone. We are given that the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]

First, we multiply 30 by 6.5:

\[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{1}{3}\):

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]

Therefore, the volume of the cone is:

\[ \boxed{65} \] cubic units.","[65, '65']",65,"[65, '65']",True
"Given that the sixth term of an arithmetic sequence is 200 and the eleventh term is 500, we need to find the 21st term of the sequence. Let's denote the first term of the sequence by \(a\) and the common difference by \(d\).

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

For the sixth term (\(a_6\)):
\[a + 5d = 200\]

For the eleventh term (\(a_{11}\)):
\[a + 10d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + 5d = 200\)
2. \(a + 10d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[(a + 10d) - (a + 5d) = 500 - 200\]
\[5d = 300\]
\[d = 60\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[a + 5(60) = 200\]
\[a + 300 = 200\]
\[a = 200 - 300\]
\[a = -100\]

Now that we have \(a = -100\) and \(d = 60\), we can find the 21st term (\(a_{21}\)) using the general formula:
\[a_{21} = a + 20d\]
\[a_{21} = -100 + 20(60)\]
\[a_{21} = -100 + 1200\]

"To determine how many three-digit numbers between 100 and 150 are divisible by 2, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the smallest three-digit number in the range that is divisible by 2. This number is 100.
2. Identify the largest three-digit number in the range that is divisible by 2. This number is 150.
3. Determine the sequence of these numbers. Since they are divisible by 2, they form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 100\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).
4. Use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence to find the number of terms in the sequence. The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a + (n-1)d

   Here, \(a_n = 150\), \(a = 100\), and \(d = 2\). Plugging in these values, we get:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the numbers on the two cards drawn from a standard deck of 52 cards is even. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the types of cards in the deck:**
   - There are 26 red cards (13 hearts and 13 diamonds).
   - There are 26 black cards (13 spades and 13 clubs).

2. **Determine the conditions for the sum to be even:**
   - The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are even or both numbers are odd.
   - Therefore, we need to calculate the probability of drawing two red cards or two black cards.

3. **Calculate the probability of drawing two red cards:**
   - The probability of drawing the first red card is \( \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - After drawing the first red card, there are 25 red cards left and 51 cards in total. So, the probability of drawing the second red card is \( \frac{25}{51} \).
   - The combined probability of drawing two red cards is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{25}{51} = \frac{25}{102} \).

4. **Calculate the probability of drawing two black cards:**
   - The probability of drawing the first black card is \( \frac{26}{52} = \frac{1}{2} \).
   - After drawing the first black card, there are 25 black cards left and 51 cards in total. So, the probability of drawing the second black card is \( \frac{25}{51} \).
   - The combined probability of drawing two black cards is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{25}{51} = \frac{25}{102} \).

"To determine the total area of the shaded regions in the given diagram, we need to analyze the two shaded triangles separately and then sum their areas.

### Step 1: Analyze the first shaded triangle
The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).

- **Base**: The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is \(2\) units.
- **Height**: The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is \(4\) units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the second shaded triangle
The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((2, 0)\).

- **Base**: The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((2, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\). To find this distance, we use the distance formula:
\[
\text{Base} = \sqrt{(3 - 2)^2 + (4 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{1 + 16} = \sqrt{17} \text{ units}
\]

- **Height**: The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to the line segment from \((2, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\). Since \((3, 4)\) is directly above \((2, 4)\), the height is the vertical distance from \((0, 4)\) to \((2, 4)\), which is \(4\) units.

The area \(A_2\) of this triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \sqrt{17} \times 4 = 2\sqrt{17} \text{ square units}

The total area \(A\) of the shaded regions is the sum of \(A_1\) and \(A_2\):
\[
A = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 2\sqrt{17}

Thus, the total area of the shaded regions is:

"To solve the problem, we need to find a four-digit number that meets the following criteria:
1. It is a multiple of 450.
2. It has exactly one digit that is zero.
3. The remaining three digits are non-zero and distinct.

First, let's factorize 450:
\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must be divisible by 2, 9, and 25. Let's consider these conditions one by one.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: The number must end in an even digit.
2. **Divisibility by 25**: The number must end in 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the number has exactly one digit that is zero, it must end in 50.
3. **Divisibility by 9**: The sum of the digits of the number must be a multiple of 9.

Given that the number ends in 50, let's represent it as \( \overline{ab50} \), where \( a \) and \( b \) are non-zero and distinct digits. The sum of the digits is \( a + b + 5 + 0 = a + b + 5 \). For the number to be divisible by 9, \( a + b + 5 \) must be a multiple of 9.

We need to find pairs of digits \( (a, b) \) such that \( a + b + 5 \) is a multiple of 9. Let's check the possible values:

- If \( a + b + 5 = 9 \), then \( a + b = 4 \). The possible pairs are (1, 3) and (3, 1).
- If \( a + b + 5 = 18 \), then \( a + b = 13 \). The possible pairs are (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), and (9, 4).
- If \( a + b + 5 = 27 \), then \( a + b = 22 \). This is not possible since the maximum sum of two digits is 18.

So, the possible pairs of digits are (1, 3), (3, 1), (4, 9), (5, 8), (6, 7), (7, 6), (8, 5), and (9, 4). We can form the numbers 1350, 3150, 4950, 5850, 6750, 7650, 8550, and 9450. All these numbers are multiples of 450 and have exactly one digit that is zero.

Therefore, the possible four-digit numbers are 1350, 3150, 4950, 5850, 6750, 7650, 8550, and 9450. Since the problem does not specify a unique solution, we can choose any one of these numbers. For the sake of providing a specific answer, we can choose the smallest number:

"To determine the probability that a checker placed on a checkerboard's central square will land on a square of the same color, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the color of the central square:**
   - A standard 8x8 checkerboard has alternating black and white squares.
   - The central square of an 8x8 checkerboard is at position (4, 4).
   - Since the checkerboard starts with a black square in the top-left corner, the central square (4, 4) will also be black.

2. **Count the total number of squares on the checkerboard:**
   - A standard 8x8 checkerboard has \(8 \times 8 = 64\) squares.

3. **Count the number of black squares:**
   - In a standard 8x8 checkerboard, half of the squares are black and half are white.
   - Therefore, the number of black squares is \( \frac{64}{2} = 32 \).

4. **Determine the probability of landing on a black square:**
   - The probability \(P\) of landing on a black square is the ratio of the number of black squares to the total number of squares.
   - Thus, \( P = \frac{\text{Number of black squares}}{\text{Total number of squares}} = \frac{32}{64} = \frac{1}{2} \).

Therefore, the probability that a checker placed on a checkerboard's central square will land on a square of the same color is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
" first, we simplify the given fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\). We can rewrite the denominator as \(5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Thus, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape of the surface given by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

1. **Understanding Cylindrical Coordinates:**
   - In cylindrical coordinates, a point in space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\).
   - \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis.
   - \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
   - \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

2. **Interpreting the Equation \(z = c\):**
   - The equation \(z = c\) means that for any point on this surface, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\).
   - This implies that the surface is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

3. **Shape of the Surface:**
   - Since \(r\) and \(\theta\) can take any value, the surface extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions.
   - The only constraint is that \(z\) is fixed at \(c\).
   - Therefore, the surface is a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\).

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[

The sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots is:

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of the interior angles of all but one of its angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of the interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all but one of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the sum of all interior angles in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for the single angle:**
   Since each interior angle of a polygon is less than \(180^\circ\), the single angle must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Set up the inequality:**
   Using the inequality for the single angle, we can write:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

7. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is:
   \[
   n = 8

Therefore, the polygon has \(\boxed{8}\) sides.","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the equation:
\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]
We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}

\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the expression for \( t \), we get:
\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4
\]
\[
t = -1 - 5 = -6
\]
Since \( t \) must satisfy \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). To verify, we check if \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23:
\[
t+2 = 4+2 = 6

\[

"To determine the total surface area of a cube in square inches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the dimensions of the cube:**
   - The cube has a side length of 1 foot.

2. **Convert the side length to inches:**
   - Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the side length in inches is:

Next, we multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

"To determine how many odd numbers are in the sequence from 1 to 2003, we first recognize that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2. The general form of the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

We need to find the value of \(n\) for which \(a_n = 2003\). Substituting the known values into the formula, we get:

First, we simplify the right side of the equation:

\[2003 = 1 + 2(n-1)\]
\[2003 = 1 + 2n - 2\]
\[2003 = 2n - 1\]

Next, we solve for \(n\) by isolating it on one side of the equation:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).

Now, we move to step 3. We need to evaluate \( g \) at \( x = 6 \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we can use the formula for the distance between two skew lines. The distance \(d\) between two skew lines given by \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}_1\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}_2\) is:
\[
d = \frac{|\mathbf{b}_1 \times \mathbf{b}_2 \cdot (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)|}{\|\mathbf{b}_1 \times \mathbf{b}_2\|}.
\]

First, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times \mathbf{b}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{b}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}.

\]

Since \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times \mathbf{b}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are parallel. The distance between two parallel lines is the perpendicular distance from any point on one line to the other line. We can use the formula for the distance between a point and a line in 3D space. The distance \(d\) from a point \(\mathbf{a}_2\) to a line \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}_1\) is:
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}_1\|}.

First, we find \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the cross product \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[

\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}_1\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b}_1 \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}_1\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of any point inside the rectangle must satisfy:

This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. The number of possible integer values for \(x\) is:

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a},
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}).

We can use the scalar multiplication property of the cross product, which states that for any scalar \(k\) and vectors \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{v}\),

\[
(k \mathbf{u}) \times \mathbf{v} = k (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (k \mathbf{v}) = k (\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v}).

Applying this property, we get:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these into the expression, we have:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

We know from the problem statement that:

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar by the Angle Bisector Theorem.

Given that \([ABCD] = 42\), we can substitute this into the equation:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]

Using the ratio of the areas, we can express \([\triangle ABC]\) in terms of \([\triangle ACD]\):
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} [\triangle ACD]
\]

Substituting this into the area equation, we get:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + \frac{b}{a} [\triangle ACD]
\]

Factoring out \([\triangle ACD]\) from the right-hand side, we have:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right)
\]

Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
1 + \frac{b}{a} = \frac{a + b}{a}
\]

Thus, the equation becomes:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] \cdot \frac{a + b}{a}
\]

Solving for \([\triangle ACD]\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{a}{a + b}\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 \cdot \frac{a}{a + b}
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle. The area of a right triangle is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

We need to find the value of \(c\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle ACD\), we use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d^2 = a^2 + c^2
\]

However, we do not have the exact value of \(d\). Instead, we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of the area of the trapezoid and the ratio of the sides. From the earlier equation:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = 42 \cdot \frac{a}{a + b}
\]

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we can use the properties of similar triangles and the area ratio to find the specific value of \(\frac{a}{a + b}\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid when \(a = b\). However, since \(a \neq b\), we need to find the specific ratio.

Given the problem constraints and the properties of the trapezoid, we find that:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 42 = 28
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation. We substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

Since the left side equals the right side, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \(x\) is:

\[

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given operation \( \frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right) \) and apply it to the fractions \( \frac{7}{30} \) and \( \frac{10}{21} \).

First, identify the values of \( m \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( q \) from the given fractions:
- For \( \frac{7}{30} \), \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 30 \).
- For \( \frac{10}{21} \), \( p = 10 \) and \( q = 21 \).

Next, substitute these values into the operation formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Now, perform the multiplication step by step:
1. Multiply \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

2. Simplify the fraction \( \frac{21}{30} \):
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{7 \times 3}{10 \times 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

3. Multiply \( 70 \) by \( \frac{7}{10} \):
\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 70 \times 0.7 = 49
\]

Thus, the result of \( \frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} \) is:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen at random on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that two line segments formed by four points on a circle intersect. For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged in an alternating pattern when traversed around the circle. That is, if we list the points in the order they appear when moving around the circle, they must be in the form \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: As mentioned earlier, the favorable arrangements are those where the points are in the form \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). There are 2 such arrangements.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve for the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the two circles and the area of the overlapping region.

The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\text{Area of larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The total area of the two circles is:
\[
\text{Total area of two circles} = \pi + 4\pi = 5\pi
\]

According to the problem, the area of the overlapping region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the overlapping region is:
\[
\text{Area of overlapping region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The area of the overlapping region can also be expressed as the sum of the areas of the two circular segments formed by the intersection of the circles. The area of a circular segment is given by the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points of intersection.

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of sector of larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of sector of smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
\]

The area of the triangle formed by the radii and the chord connecting the points of intersection can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides and the included angle:
\[
\text{Area of triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \sin(\theta)
\]

Therefore, the area of the overlapping region is:
\[
\text{Area of overlapping region} = 2\theta - \sin(\theta) + \frac{1}{2}\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{5}{2}\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
\]

We know that this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5}{2}\theta - 2\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve this equation, we can use numerical methods or recognize that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution. Let's verify:
\[
\frac{5}{2} \times \frac{2\pi}{3} - 2\sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{5\pi}{3} - 2 \times \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - \sqrt{3}
\]

However, we need to recheck the problem statement and correct the logical steps to find the correct value of

"To determine how many 6 cm diameter spheres can fit into a spherical tank with a diameter of 8 cm, we need to compare the volumes of the two spheres. The volume \( V \) of a sphere is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]

First, we calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The radius \( r \) of the tank is half of its diameter, so:

\[ r = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ cm} \]

The volume of the tank is:

\[ V_{\text{tank}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (4)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (64) = \frac{256}{3} \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, we calculate the volume of one of the smaller spheres. The radius \( r \) of each smaller sphere is half of its diameter, so:

\[ r = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ cm} \]

The volume of one smaller sphere is:

\[ V_{\text{small sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (3)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi (27) = 36 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a subset of 5 elements from a set of 8 rice balls and 6 dice such that each subset contains exactly one rice ball and one die from each of the three pairs of rice balls and dice, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the pairs**: We have 3 pairs of rice balls and dice. Let's denote the rice balls as \( R_1, R_2, R_3 \) and the dice as \( D_1, D_2, D_3 \).

2. **Choose one rice ball from each pair**: For each pair, we have 2 choices (either \( R_1 \) or \( R_2 \) or \( R_3 \)). However, since we need exactly one rice ball from each pair, we have 2 choices for the first pair, 2 choices for the second pair, and 2 choices for the third pair. Therefore, the number of ways to choose one rice ball from each pair is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
   \]

3. **Choose one die from each pair**: Similarly, for each pair, we have 2 choices (either \( D_1 \) or \( D_2 \) or \( D_3 \)). However, since we need exactly one die from each pair, we have 2 choices for the first pair, 2 choices for the second pair, and 2 choices for the third pair. Therefore, the number of ways to choose one die from each pair is:
   \[
   2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8
   \]

4. **Combine the choices**: Since the choice of rice balls is independent of the choice of dice, the total number of ways to form a subset of 5 elements (one rice ball and one die from each pair) is the product of the number of ways to choose the rice balls and the number of ways to choose the dice:
   \[
   8 \times 8 = 64

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26
\]

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000
\]

Now, we multiply these two results together:

\[

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

"Let the three consecutive whole numbers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). According to the problem, their product is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[

\]

We also know that the sum of these three numbers divided by 3 is 24. So, we can write:

\[

\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[

Now that we have \( n = 24 \), the three consecutive whole numbers are \( 23 \), \( 24 \), and \( 25 \). To find the greatest of these three numbers, we simply identify the largest one, which is \( 25 \).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result. Therefore, we have:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we can substitute this value in:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

We need to check if both solutions are valid by substituting them back into the original equation. First, let's check \(x = 66\):

\[
\sqrt[3]{66^2 - 4 \cdot 66 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4356 - 264 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4100} = \sqrt[3]{4096} = 16
\]

So, \(x = 66\) is a valid solution. Next, let's check \(x = -62\):

\[
\sqrt[3]{(-62)^2 - 4 \cdot (-62) + 4} = \sqrt[3]{3844 + 248 + 4} = \sqrt[3]{4096} = 16
\]

So, \(x = -62\) is also a valid solution. However, the problem asks for the value of \(x\) that gives a positive square root. Since both solutions are valid, we need to consider the context of the problem. If we are looking for the positive root of the square root expression, we should consider the positive root of the original equation. But if we are looking for the positive value of \(x\) that satisfies the equation, we should consider the positive value of \(x\).

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. Notice that:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) \right) \left( \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) \right).
\]

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\), \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\), \(\cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right)\), and \(\cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\]

Using the identity \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) = \frac{1}{4}\) and \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we get:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{4} \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \left( -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{8} \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = -\frac{1}{8} \cos^2 \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right).

Therefore, we have:

\[
\left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2^{14}} \cdot \frac{1}{8} = \frac{1}{2^{17}}.

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we know that \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

We are also given that \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), since \( D \) lies on \( AM \), \( \angle BDC \) is an external angle to \( \triangle BDM \). Therefore, \( \angle BDC = \angle BDM + \angle CDM \). Since \( \triangle BDM \) and \( \triangle CDM \) are congruent (by symmetry), \( \angle BDM = \angle CDM \). Thus, \( \angle BDC = 2\angle BDM \). Given that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \), we have \( 2\angle BDM = 3\theta \), so \( \angle BDM = \frac{3\theta}{2} \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), \( \angle BDM = \frac{3\theta}{2} \), \( \angle BMD = 90^\circ \), and \( \angle DBM = 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2} \). Using the tangent function in \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\tan \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x.
\]
We also know that in \( \triangle ABM \), \( \angle ABM = \angle ACM = \frac{\theta}{2} \) and \( \angle AMB = 90^\circ \). Using the tangent function in \( \triangle ABM \), we have:
\[
\tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = \frac{BM}{AM} = \frac{x}{11}.
\]
We use the triple angle identity for tangent, which states:
\[
\tan \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = \frac{3\tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) - \tan^3 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}{1 - 3\tan^2 \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right)}.
\]
Substituting \( \tan \left( \frac{3\theta}{2} \right) = x \) and \( \tan \left( \frac{\theta}{2} \right) = \frac{x}{11} \) into the identity, we get:
\[
x = \frac{3 \cdot \frac{x}{11} - \left( \frac{x}{11} \right)^3}{1 - 3 \left( \frac{x}{11} \right)^2} = \frac{\frac{3x}{11} - \frac{x^3}{1331}}{1 - \frac{3x^2}{121}} = \frac{\frac{3x \cdot 121 - x^3}{1331}}{\frac{121 - 3x^2}{121}} = \frac{363x - x^3}{1331} \cdot \frac{121}{121 - 3x^2} = \frac{363x - x^3}{11(121 - 3x^2)}.
\]
Multiplying both sides by \( 11(121 - 3x^2) \), we get:
\[
11x(121 - 3x^2) = 363x - x^3.
\]
Assuming \( x \neq 0 \), we can divide both sides by \( x \):
\[
11(121 - 3x^2) = 363 - x^2.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
1331 - 33x^2 = 363 - x^2.

Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
1331 - 363 = 33x^2 - x^2,

\[
x^2 = \frac{968}{32} = 30.25,

\[
x = \sqrt{30.25} = 5.5.

Therefore, \( BC = 2x = 2 \cdot 5.5 = 11 \).

In \( \triangle ABM \), using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + 5.5^2 = 121 + 30.25 = 151.25,

\[
AB = \sqrt{151.25} = 11\sqrt{1.25} = 11 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2} = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}.

This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a = 3^1 = 3\) and the common ratio \(r = 3\). The median of a sequence with an odd number of terms is the middle term. Since there are 27 terms, the middle term is the 14th term in the sequence.

"To solve the inequality \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \)

First, observe that \( x^4 \) and \( 4x^2 \) are both non-negative for all real numbers \( x \). Therefore, \( x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0 \). Since \( 0 > -4 \), the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 > -4 \) is always true for all real numbers \( x \).

### Step 2: Solve \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \( x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \( y = x^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:

\[
y^2 + 4y < 21
\]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[
y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
\]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \( y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic equation:

\[
y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[
y + 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -7
\]
\[
y - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 3
\]

Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we discard \( y = -7 \) because it is not in the domain of \( y \). Therefore, we only consider \( y = 3 \).

Next, we determine the intervals where \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \). The critical point \( y = 3 \) divides the number line into two intervals: \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \). We test a point from each interval in the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[
  0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0
  \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is true for \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \).

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[
  4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0
  \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is false for \( y \in (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is:

\[
y \in (-\infty, 3)
\]

Since \( y = x^2 \) and \( x^2 \geq 0 \), we combine these conditions to get:

\[
0 \leq x^2 < 3
\]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:

\[
-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

Combining the solutions from both parts of the original inequality, we find that the values of \( x \) that satisfy \( -4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21 \) are:

将给定的值 \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) 和 \(xyz = 4\) 代入恒等式，我们得到：
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
这简化为：
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
或
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

接下来，我们使用平方和的恒等式：
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
设 \(s = x+y+z\) 和 \(p = xy + yz + zx\)。那么方程变为：
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = s^2 - 2p.
\]
将此代入立方和的恒等式，我们得到：
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

我们还从给定的方程中知道：
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]
这可以重写为：
\[
xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = 12.
\]
使用 \(x+y+z = s\)，我们可以将此表达式重写为：
\[
xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = 12.
\]
展开并简化，我们得到：
\[
xyz - xyz + xys + xz^2 + yxz + yz^2 + yzx + yz^2 + zxy + z^2x - xyz = 12,
\]
这简化为：
\[
3xyz + s(xy + yz + zx) = 12.
\]
将 \(xyz = 4\) 代入此方程，我们得到：
\[
3 \cdot 4 + s p = 12,
\]
或
\[
12 + sp = 12,
\]
这简化为：
\[
sp = 0.
\]
由于 \(s = x+y+z\) 且 \(p = xy + yz + zx\)，且 \(s\) 和 \(p\) 不能同时为零（因为 \(xyz = 4\)），我们得出结论 \(s = 0\)。将 \(s = 0\) 代入方程 \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\)，我们得到：
\[
-8 = 0(0^2 - 3p) = 0,
\]
这是不正确的。因此，我们得出结论 \(s = 0\)。

将 \(s = 0\) 代入方程 \(sp = 0\)，我们得到：
\[
sp = 0.
]

由于 \(s = 0\) and \(sp = 0\), we conclude that \(s = 0 and sp = 0.

"To determine which grade has a greater difference between the number of students who passed and the number of students who failed, we need to calculate the difference for each grade and then compare these differences.

First, let's calculate the number of students who passed and failed in each grade, given that there are 300 students in each grade.

**9th Grade:**
- Percentage of students who passed: \(41.1\%\)
- Number of students who passed: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3 \approx 123\) (since the number of students must be a whole number)
- Percentage of students who failed: \(39.4\%\)
- Number of students who failed: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
- Difference: \(123 - 118 = 5\)

**10th Grade:**
- Percentage of students who passed: \(34.4\%\)
- Number of students who passed: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
- Percentage of students who failed: \(33.1\%\)
- Number of students who failed: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
- Difference: \(103 - 99 = 4\)

**11th Grade:**
- Percentage of students who passed: \(20.6\%\)
- Number of students who passed: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
- Percentage of students who failed: \(13.8\%\)
- Number of students who failed: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
- Difference: \(62 - 41 = 21\)

**12th Grade:**
- Percentage of students who passed: \(11.6\%\)
- Number of students who passed: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
- Percentage of students who failed: \(8.6\%\)
- Number of students who failed: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
- Difference: \(35 - 26 = 9\)

Now, we compare the differences:
- 9th Grade: \(5\)
- 10th Grade: \(4\)
- 11th Grade: \(21\)
- 12th Grade: \(9\)

The greatest difference is \(21\), which occurs in the 11th grade. Therefore, the grade with the greatest difference between the number of students who passed and the number of students who failed is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the roots of the numerator and the denominator, which are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-10)^2 - 36(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-1)^2 - 36(-1) = 1 + 36 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 1^2 - 36(1) = 1 - 36 = -35.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 10^2 - 36(10) = 100 - 360 = -260.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 37^2 - 36(37) = 1369 - 1332 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[\boxed{(0, 9) \cup (9, 36)}.\]","[Union(Interval.open(0, 9), Interval.open(9, 36)), '(0, 9) \\cup (9, 36)']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"To determine the maximum possible area of the field, we need to analyze the given constraints and the shape of the field. The field is composed of a rectangle with two semicircles on its top and bottom sides. The total length of the track is 400 meters, which includes the lengths of the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width of the rectangle by \( W \). The circumference of each semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with radius \( W/2 \), which is \( \pi W/2 \). Therefore, the total length of the track is given by:
\[ L + L + \frac{\pi W}{2} + \frac{\pi W}{2} = 2L + \pi W. \]
We know that this total length is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[ 2L + \pi W = 400. \]
Solving for \( L \), we get:
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}. \]

The area \( A \) of the field is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times W \), and the area of each semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi \left( \frac{W}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2} \pi \frac{W^2}{4} = \frac{\pi W^2}{8} \). Therefore, the total area of the field is:
\[ A = L W + 2 \cdot \frac{\pi W^2}{8} = L W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4}. \]
Substituting \( L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ A = \left( 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} \right) W + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{2\pi W^2}{4} + \frac{\pi W^2}{4} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{4}. \]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2} = 0, \]
\[ \frac{\pi W}{2} = 200, \]
\[ W = \frac{400}{\pi}. \]

Now, we substitute \( W = \frac{400}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[ L = 200 - \frac{\pi}{2} \cdot \frac{400}{\pi} = 200 - 200 = 0. \]
This result is incorrect because it implies \( L = 0 \), which is not possible. Let's recheck the calculations.

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(ST\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Recall the definition of sine again:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we need to minimize the distance function \( d \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance \( d \) is given by:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
d = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To minimize \( d \), it is equivalent to minimize \( d^2 \) (since the square root function is increasing). Let \( f(x) = d^2 \):

\[
f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Find the critical points by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set \( f'(x) = 0 \):

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( d \) is:

\[
d = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that the minimum distance is \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we identify \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Therefore, \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \).

"To determine the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the cube, we first need to understand the structure of the cube and the given distances. Let's denote the vertices of the cube as follows: \( A = (1,0,0) \), \( B = (-1,0,0) \), \( C = (0,1,0) \), \( D = (0,-1,0) \), \( E = (0,0,1) \), \( F = (0,0,-1) \), and let \( P = (x,y,z) \).

The distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, \) and \( F \) are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 11. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to the seventh vertex, which is the opposite vertex of \( A \), denoted as \( A' = (-1,0,0) \).

First, we use the distance formula to express the given distances:
\[
PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
PC = \sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
PD = \sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
\[
PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]
\[
PF = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2} = 11
\]

We square each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2 = 121
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Now, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) - y^2 = 55
\]
\[
-2y + 2x = 55
\]
\[
x - y = \frac{55}{2}
\]
\[
10 - y = \frac{55}{2}
\]
\[
y = 10 - \frac{55}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{20}{2} - \frac{55}{2}
\]
\[
y = -\frac{35}{2}
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 - y^2 = 72
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) - y^2 = 72
\]
\[
2y + 2x = 72
\]
\[
x + y = 36
\]
\[
10 + y = 36
\]
\[
y = 26

"To determine the ratio of the rate of growth of the sooty black cat to the rate of growth of the black cat, we need to use the information given about their initial weights and the fact that they grow at the same rate.

Let's denote the rate of growth of both cats as \( r \) grams per unit time. The initial weight of the sooty black cat is 200 grams, and the initial weight of the black cat is 150 grams. After some time \( t \), the weight of the sooty black cat will be \( 200 + rt \) grams, and the weight of the black cat will be \( 150 + rt \) grams.

The problem states that after some time, the weight of the sooty black cat is equal to the weight of the black cat plus the weight of the black cat's body. This means that the weight of the sooty black cat is twice the weight of the black cat at that time. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 200 + rt = 2(150 + rt) \]

Now, let's solve this equation step by step.

First, expand the right side of the equation:

\[ 200 + rt = 300 + 2rt \]

Next, isolate the terms involving \( rt \) on one side of the equation by subtracting \( rt \) from both sides:

\[ 200 = 300 + rt \]

Then, isolate \( rt \) by subtracting 300 from both sides:

\[ -100 = rt \]

This equation tells us that the rate of growth \( r \) is such that the weight difference between the sooty black cat and the black cat is always 50 grams, and the black cat grows at a rate that keeps this difference constant. However, we need to find the ratio of the rate of growth of the sooty black cat to the rate of growth of the black cat, which is simply 1 because they grow at the same rate.

Therefore, the ratio of the rate of growth of the sooty black cat to the rate of growth of the black cat is:

"Given the polynomial equation \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) with roots \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\), we need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which relate the coefficients of the polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:
\[
a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\). The sum of the roots of this polynomial is:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
and the product of the roots is:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^3 = 2^3 = 8.
\]

The polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is the quadratic polynomial whose roots are the sums of the roots taken two at a time. The sum of the roots of this polynomial is \(a + b + c = 0\), and the product of the roots is \(ab + bc + ca\). We can find \(ab + bc + ca\) using the identity:
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
0^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2),
\]
\[
0 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 - 8,
\]
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 8.
\]
Since \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2\), we have:
\[
a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 8.
\]
We also know that:
\[
(a + b + c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),
\]
\[
0^2 = 8 + 2(ab + bc + ca),
\]
\[
0 = 8 + 2(ab + bc + ca),
\]
\[
2(ab + bc + ca) = -8,
\]
\[
ab + bc + ca = -4.
\]

Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
\[
t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = t^3 - 0 \cdot t^2 - 4t - (-2) = t^3 - 4t + 2.
\]

The roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 4t + 2 = 0\) are the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots \(\pm 1, \pm 2\). Testing \(t = 1\):
\[
1^3 - 4 \cdot 1 + 2 = 1 - 4 + 2 = -1 \neq 0,
\]
so \(t = 1\) is not a root. Testing \(t = -1\):
\[
(-1)^3 - 4 \cdot (-1) + 2 = -1 + 4 + 2 = 5 \neq 0,
\]
so \(t = -1\) is not a root. Testing \(t = 2\):
\[
2^3 - 4 \cdot 2 + 2 = 8 - 8 + 2 = 2 \neq 0,
\]
so \(t = 2\) is not a root. Testing \(t = -2\):
\[
(-2)^3 - 4 \cdot (-2) + 2 = -8 + 8 + 2 = 2 \neq 0,
\]
so \(t = -2\) is not a root. However, we can use numerical methods or factorization to find the roots. By factorization, we find that the roots are approximately \(\sqrt{2}\), \(-\sqrt{2}\), and \(\sqrt{2} - 2\).

Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"Let's define the cost of one eraser as \( e \) dollars and the cost of one pencil as \( p \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

2. The cost of five erasers and one pencil is $1.82:

To find the cost of one eraser, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( p \):
\[

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's do the division step by step.

1. **Set up the division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. Since 137 is less than 500, we will add a decimal point and some zeros to 137 to make the division possible.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - \(500\) goes into \(1370\) (which is \(137\) with an added zero) \(2\) times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\).
   - Subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
   - Bring down another zero to make it \(3700\).
   - \(500\) goes into \(3700\) \(7\) times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\).
   - Subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
   - Bring down another zero to make it \(2000\).
   - \(500\) goes into \(2000\) \(4\) times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\).
   - Subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

So, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

3. **Identify the digits in the decimal**: The decimal \(0.274\) has three digits after the decimal point: \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\).

4. **Determine the sum of these digits**:
   \[
   2 + 7 + 4 = 13

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the square \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices of the square. Let's start by analyzing the geometric conditions.

1. **Identify the regions of interest:**
   - The center \(O\) of the square is equidistant from all four vertices.
   - The locus of points that are equidistant from a vertex and the center \(O\) is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining the vertex and \(O\).

2. **Determine the perpendicular bisectors:**
   - For vertex \(A\), the perpendicular bisector of \(AO\) is a line passing through the midpoint of \(AO\) and perpendicular to \(AO\).
   - Similarly, we can find the perpendicular bisectors for vertices \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\).

3. **Intersection of perpendicular bisectors:**
   - The perpendicular bisectors of the segments \(AO\), \(BO\), \(CO\), and \(DO\) will intersect at the center \(O\) and form four congruent right triangles within the square.

4. **Area of the regions:**
   - Each of these four right triangles has an equal area.
   - The area of one right triangle is \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the area of the square.

5. **Probability calculation:**
   - Since there are four such right triangles, the total area of the regions where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any vertex is the sum of the areas of these four triangles.
   - Therefore, the total area of the regions where a point is closer to \(O\) is \(4 \times \frac{1}{4} = 1\) times the area of the square.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the square is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the regions closer to \(O\) to the area of the square.
   - Since the area of the regions closer to \(O\) is equal to the area of the square, the probability is \(\frac{1}{2}\).

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the square \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",True
"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that:

\[a = bq + r\]

where \(0 \leq r < b\).

In this problem, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:

\[54 = 6q + r\]

and \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]

1. Calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \):
   \[ \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472. \]
2. Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
   \[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
1. Calculate \( \sqrt{45} \):
   \[ \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708. \]
2. Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
   \[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
1. Calculate \( 8^{2/3} \):
   \[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^{3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4. \]

(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + n + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Now, let's calculate the sum of the first column:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = n - 3 + n + 2 + 2 = 2n + 1
\]

Next, let's calculate the sum of the second column:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + 2n - 9 + n = 3n - 6
\]

Then, let's calculate the sum of the third column:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = n + 1 + 1 + n - 1 = 2n + 1
\]

Finally, let's calculate the sum of the main diagonal (top-left to bottom-right):
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = n - 3 + 2n - 9 + n - 1 = 4n - 13
\]

And the sum of the other diagonal (top-right to bottom-left):
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = n + 1 + 2n - 9 + 2 = 3n - 6
\]

Since the sum of each row, each column, and each diagonal must be the same, we can set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6
\]

Solving for \( n \):
\[
2n + 1 = 3n - 6 \implies 1 + 6 = 3n - 2n \implies 7 = n
\]

We can verify this value by checking the sums:
- Sum of the first row: \( 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second row: \( 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third row: \( 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the first column: \( 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the second column: \( 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \)
- Sum of the third column: \( 2(7) + 1 = 14 + 1 = 15 \)
- Sum of the main diagonal: \( 4(7) - 13 = 28 - 13 = 15 \)
- Sum of the other diagonal: \( 3(7) - 6 = 21 - 6 = 15 \)

All the sums are equal to 15, confirming that \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet Jifiera Matora will walk, we need to consider the path she takes. She starts at the bottom-left corner of the square and walks along the perimeter to return to the same point.

The square has a length of 400 feet and a width of 300 feet. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
\text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ feet}
\]
Therefore, Jifiera Matora will walk \(\boxed{1400}\) feet.","[1400, '1400']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), and they satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) and \(\omega = -1 - \omega^2\).

We need to find the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). Let's start by finding a common denominator for the two fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Using the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we can simplify the numerator:

\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

So the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

Therefore, the value is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the minimum possible distance between any two points among four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) on a plane such that no three points are collinear, we can consider the geometric configuration that minimizes the maximum distance between any two points. This configuration is a regular tetrahedron, but since we are dealing with points on a plane, the next best configuration is a square.

Let's assume the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) form a square with side length \(s\). In a square, the distance between any two adjacent points (i.e., the side length) is \(s\), and the distance between any two opposite points (i.e., the diagonal) is \(s\sqrt{2}\). The maximum distance between any two points in a square is the length of the diagonal, which is \(s\sqrt{2}\).

To minimize the maximum distance, we need to minimize \(s\sqrt{2}\). However, since we are asked for the minimum possible distance between any two points, we need to consider the side length \(s\) itself. The minimum possible distance between any two points in a square is the side length \(s\).

Therefore, the minimum possible distance between any two points among four points on a plane such that no three points are collinear is \(\boxed{1}\). This assumes that the points are arranged in such a way that the minimum distance between any two points is 1, which is the side length of the smallest possible square that can be formed with integer coordinates. However, if we consider the actual minimum distance in a more general sense without integer constraints, the answer would be \(\boxed{1}\) if we assume the points are arranged in a configuration that minimizes the maximum distance between any two points.","[1, '1']",13,"[13, '13']",True
