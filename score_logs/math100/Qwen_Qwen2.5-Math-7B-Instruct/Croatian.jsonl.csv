"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) around the origin:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 lude can sit around a round table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 lude) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 positions to fill and the number of permutations of 3 items is \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 lude around the table with Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sitting together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 lude can sit around a round table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}

Now multiply these reduced factors together:

\[

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[

"To determine the minimal number of degrees by which Pravilni peterokut must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to consider the properties of a regular pentagon. A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When it is rotated, it will return to its original position after a certain angle of rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the pentagon.

The angle of rotation for each side of the pentagon is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram given vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\). We need to find the coordinates of \(D\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, we need to consider the possibility that \(D\) is not the fourth vertex but rather the vertex that makes \(AC\) and \(BD\) the diagonals in a different order. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the possibility that \(D\) is the fourth vertex such that \(AB\) and \(CD\) are parallel and equal.

Let's calculate the vector \(\overrightarrow{AB}\):
\[
\overrightarrow{AB} = (6-5, 8-3) = (1, 5)
\]

Since \(AB\) is parallel to \(CD\), the vector \(\overrightarrow{CD}\) must also be \((1, 5)\):
\[
\overrightarrow{CD} = (x-7, y-4) = (1, 5)
\]

Solving for \(x\) and \(y\):
\[
x-7 = 1 \implies x = 8
\]
\[
y-4 = 5 \implies y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of \(D\) are \((8, 9)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) that make the denominator zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[

\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

We need to find the weight of one treeksa in terms of the weight of one squig, so we will solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
10t = 4s - 2t
\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( t \) on one side:
\[
12t = 4s
\]
Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( t \):
\[
t = \frac{s}{3}
\]

Now we know that the weight of one treeksa is \( \frac{s}{3} \). To find the weight of one treeksa in terms of the weight of one squig, we simply use the expression we found:
\[
t = \frac{s}{3}
\]

Therefore, the weight of one treeksa is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\) of the weight of one squig.","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical spremnik, we start by using the given information about the rate at which the spremnik is being filled with water and the rate at which the water level rises.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We know that the spremnik is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per second, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per second. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The rate of change of the volume with respect to time can also be expressed in terms of the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We are given that \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \) meters per second. Substituting this into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the spremnik is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of the function \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both intervals \( x \geq a \) and \( x < a \).

1. **For \( x \geq a \):**
   The function is given by \( f(x) = ax^2 \). This is a parabola opening upwards if \( a > 0 \) and downwards if \( a < 0 \). If \( a = 0 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \geq a \), which means the function only intersects the horizontal line \( y = 0 \).

2. **For \( x < a \):**
   The function is given by \( f(x) = ax + 2a \). This is a straight line with slope \( a \). If \( a > 0 \), the line is increasing, and if \( a < 0 \), the line is decreasing. If \( a = 0 \), then \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x < a \), which means the function only intersects the horizontal line \( y = 0 \).

To ensure that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of \( f(x) \) in both intervals.

- **If \( a > 0 \):**
  - For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \) takes all values from \( a^3 \) to \( \infty \).
  - For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) takes all values from \( -\infty \) to \( a^2 + 2a \).
  - For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of \( f(x) \) must cover all real numbers. This means \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \). Solving this inequality:
    \[
    a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0 \implies a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0 \implies a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0.
    \]
    The roots of the equation \( a(a-2)(a+1) = 0 \) are \( a = 0 \), \( a = 2 \), and \( a = -1 \). Testing intervals around these roots, we find that the inequality \( a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0 \) holds for \( -1 \leq a \leq 2 \). Since \( a > 0 \), we have \( 0 < a \leq 2 \).

- **If \( a < 0 \):**
  - For \( x \geq a \), \( f(x) = ax^2 \) takes all values from \( a^3 \) to \( 0 \).
  - For \( x < a \), \( f(x) = ax + 2a \) takes all values from \( a^2 + 2a \) to \( \infty \).
  - For the function to intersect every horizontal line, the range of \( f(x) \) must cover all real numbers. This means \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \). However, since \( a < 0 \), \( a^3 \) is negative and \( a^2 + 2a \) is negative or zero, so \( a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a \) is always true. Therefore, \( a < 0 \) is always valid.

- **If \( a = 0 \):**
  - For \( x \geq 0 \), \( f(x) = 0 \).
  - For \( x < 0 \), \( f(x) = 0 \).
  - The function only intersects the horizontal line \( y = 0 \).

From the above analysis, the largest value of \( a \) such that the graph of \( f(x) \) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \( a = 2 \).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation that are not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots of the cubic equation are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\). Testing \(x = 1\):
\[
-\lambda^4 (1)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(1)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)(1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 - \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^3 - 1.
\]
For \(x = 1\) to be a root, we need:
\[
\lambda^3 - 1 = 0 \implies \lambda = 1.
\]
If \(\lambda = 1\), then \(f(x) = x(1 - x)\) and \(f(f(x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x(1 - x)) = x(1 - x)(1 - x + x^2) = x(1 - x + x^2 - x + x^2) = x(1 + x^2 - 2x) = x(1 - x)^2\). The equation \(f(f(x)) = x\) becomes:
\[
x(1 - x)^2 = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
(1 - x)^2 = 1 \implies 1 - x = \pm 1.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
1 - x = 1 \implies x = 0 \quad \text{(not valid since \(x \neq 0\))},
\]
\[
1 - x = -1 \implies x = 2 \quad \text{(not valid since \(x \in [0,1]\)}.
\]
Therefore, there are no solutions for \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) when \(\lambda = 1\).

Next, we test \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\):
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda + (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda + 2\lambda + \lambda^2 - 1 - \lambda + \lambda^2 - 1 = 2\lambda^2 - 2.
\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda}\) to be a root, we need:
\[
2\lambda^2 - 2 = 0 \implies \lambda^2 = 1 \implies \lambda = 1 \quad \text{(not valid since we already know \(\lambda = 1\) does not work)}.
\]
Therefore, there are no rational roots other than \(\lambda = 1\). However, we need to check if there are any other real roots for the cubic equation. By numerical methods or graphing, we find that there is a real root \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the cubic equation becomes:
\[
-8x^3 + 12x^2 - 6x + 3 = 0.
\]
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{8}\). Testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 6\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 12 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 6 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + 3 - 3 + 3 = 2.
\]
Therefore, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is not a root. However, we can use numerical methods to find that there is a real root \(x \approx 0.5\). Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is:

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]

By symmetry and trigonometric identities, we find that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \tan 35^\circ.

- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.

First, let's consider the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y)
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_x = \frac{(1 - y^2) - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Similarly, for the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule again:

\[
f_y = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2}

Simplifying the first term:

\[
f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_y = \frac{-xy + (1 - x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{1 - x^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]

To find the critical points, we set both partial derivatives to zero:

\[
f_x = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad f_y = 0

This gives us the system of equations:

\[
\frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{1 - x^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0

Simplifying these equations:

\[
1 - y^2 - xy = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 1 - x^2 - xy = 0

Subtracting the second equation from the first:

\[
(1 - y^2 - xy) - (1 - x^2 - xy) = 0
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - y^2 = 0

Factoring the difference of squares:

\[
(x - y)(x + y) = 0

Thus, we have two cases:

\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - x^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2x) \right)
\]

Simplifying the derivative:

\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \left( \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]

Setting the derivative to zero:

\[
2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) and \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) back into \( f(x, x) \):

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1
\]

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1
\]

**Case 2: \( x = -y \)**

Substitute \( x = -y \) into the function \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(x, -x) = x \sqrt{1 - (-x)^2} + (-x) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} - x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0
\]

Thus, \( f(x, -x) = 0 \) for all \( x \).

** boundary points:**

We also need to check the boundary points where \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \):

- If \( x = 1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = \sqrt{1 - y^2}
  \]
  The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 1 when \( y = 0 \).

- If \( x = -1 \) and \( -1 \le y \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} + 0 = -\sqrt{1 - y^2}
  \]
  The minimum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is -1 when \( y = 0 \).

- If \( y = 1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2}
  \]
  The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1 when \( x = 0 \).

- If \( y = -1 \) and \( -1 \le x \le 1 \):
  \[
  f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0 - \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2}
  \]
  The minimum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is -1 when \( x = 0 \).

From all these cases, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is:

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we start by determining the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). We are given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) can be found using the magnitude of the cross product of vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}
\]

We expand this determinant along the first row:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:
\[
\mathbf{i} (2 + 6) - \mathbf{j} (1 + 9) + \mathbf{k} (-2 + 6) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8 - \mathbf{j} \cdot 10 + \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2}
\]

Calculate each term inside the square root:
\[
8^2 = 64, \quad (-10)^2 = 100, \quad 4^2 = 16
\]

Add these values together:
\[
64 + 100 + 16 = 180
\]

Take the square root of the sum:
\[
\sqrt{180} = \sqrt{36 \cdot 5} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the area of triangle \(OAB\) is:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), it intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\). By the properties of similar triangles, \(\triangle AMN\) is similar to \(\triangle ABC\) and the ratio of the corresponding sides is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangle to the full height from the vertices to the opposite sides. Specifically, since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of \(\triangle AMN\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Given that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is 144, the area of \(\triangle AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ENG\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides \(\triangle AMN\) into three smaller triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ENG\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of \(\triangle AMN\):
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{3} \times 64 = \frac{64}{3}.

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ENG\) is \(\boxed{\frac{64}{3}}\).","[64/3, '\\frac{64}{3}']",8,"[8, '8']",False

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]

1. **Simplify the denominator:**
   The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). We can rewrite this as:
   \[
   2^2 = 4

   \[
   5^7 = 78125

2. **Calculate the product of the denominator:**

   Let's do the division step-by-step:
   - \(312500\) goes into \(21\) zero times.
   - Add a decimal point and a zero to make it \(210\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(210\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(2100\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(21000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(21000\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(210000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(210000\) zero times.
   - Add another zero to make it \(2100000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2100000\) six times (since \(312500 \times 6 = 1875000\)).
   - Subtract \(1875000\) from \(2100000\) to get a remainder of \(225000\).
   - Add another zero to make it \(2250000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(2250000\) seven times (since \(312500 \times 7 = 2187500\)).
   - Subtract \(2187500\) from \(2250000\) to get a remainder of \(62500\).
   - Add another zero to make it \(625000\).
   - \(312500\) goes into \(625000\) two times (since \(312500 \times 2 = 625000\)).

"To determine the probability that the sum of two numbers chosen at random from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. These are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Now, we calculate the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from the 1 even number available. This is:

\[
\binom{1}{2} = 0
\]

Since it is not possible to choose 2 even numbers from only 1 even number, we consider the number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the 5 odd numbers available. This is:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10
\]

The total number of favorable outcomes (choosing 2 odd numbers) is 10. Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}

"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

2. Solve the resulting equation for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Now, we need to isolate \( b \). We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Finally, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

"To determine the total area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the two shaded triangles.

First, let's identify the coordinates of the vertices of the triangles:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Area of the First Triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

### Area of the Second Triangle
The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units.
The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_2\) of a triangle is given by the formula:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

Substituting the values:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ square units}

### Total Area of the Shaded Region
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0s and 1s, we start by analyzing the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must end in ""00"".

Next, we need to ensure that the number has at least one factor of 2. Since the number ends in ""00"", it already satisfies this condition.

Now, we need to ensure that the number has at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the number must contain at least two 1s to have a sum of digits that is divisible by 3.

Combining these conditions, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 1100. Let's verify:

- The number 1100 ends in ""00"", so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- The number 1100 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 1100 is \(1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 2\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 1100 is not a valid solution.

We need to find a larger number. Let's try 11100. Let's verify:

- The number 11100 ends in ""00"", so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- The number 11100 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 11100 is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.

Since 11100 meets all the criteria, it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are only 0s and 1s. Therefore, the answer is:

"To determine the probability that the figure is postavлena na zasjugjeno polje шahovske ploče, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of possible outcomes.
2. Identify the number of favorable outcomes.
3. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.

**Step 1: Identify the total number of possible outcomes.**

The first broj is obtained by dividing a randomly chosen number from the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} by 4 and considering the remainder. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, and 0. However, since the problem specifies that the remainder must be one of 1, 2, or 3, there are 3 possible outcomes for the first broj.

The second broj is obtained by dividing a randomly chosen number from the set \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\} by 5 and considering the remainder. The possible remainders are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 0. However, since the problem specifies that the remainder must be one of 1, 2, 3, or 4, there are 4 possible outcomes for the second broj.

Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:
\[ 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

**Step 2: Identify the number of favorable outcomes.**

The probability that the figure is postavlena na zasjugjeno polje шahovske ploče is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[

"To determine the shape described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis,
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane,
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\). This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(c\) in the \(z\)-direction.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]
\[
49(x + 5)^2 = 49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = 49x^2 + 490x + 1225
\]
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]

Substituting these expanded forms back into the expression for \( g(x) \), we get:

\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) - (49x^2 + 490x + 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015

Now, we combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015

\[

\[

\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[

\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

However, we already know that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\), so we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

This implies that \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\).

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the missing interior angle. Therefore, the total sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A
   \]

3. **Relate the total sum to the formula:**
   According to the formula, the total sum of the interior angles is also:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Set up the equation:**
   Equate the two expressions for the total sum:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We need to find \(A\) such that:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Isolate \(n\):**
   First, solve the inequality for \(n\):
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the smallest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

   Next, solve the inequality:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \(n\) is 8.

7. **Conclusion:**
   The only integer value for \(n\) that satisfies both inequalities is \(n = 8\).

Therefore, the number of sides of the convex polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the definition of the inverse. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, \( x = t+2 \), so we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can test values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (23-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\
4^2 &\equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \\

10^2 &\equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}, \\
11^2 &\equiv 121 \equiv 6 \pmod{23}.
\end{aligned}
\]

From the above calculations, we see that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since we are looking for a positive odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = -6 \). To convert \(-6\) to a positive equivalent modulo 23, we add 23:

\[ -6 + 23 = 17 \]

Thus, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the surface area using the side length.

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
To find \( s \), we take the cube root of both sides:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \]
So, the side length of the cube is 1 foot.

**Step 2: Calculate the surface area using the side length.**

The surface area \( A \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = 6s^2 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We already know that \( s = 1 \) foot, so we substitute this value into the formula:
\[ A = 6 \times 1^2 = 6 \times 1 = 6 \]
So, the surface area of the cube is 6 square feet.

Since the problem asks for the surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, we multiply the surface area in square feet by 144:
\[ 6 \times 144 = 864 \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

"To determine the position of the number 2003 in the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that the sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]
Substituting the values for \(a_1\) and \(d\) into the formula, we get:

a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 1 + 2n - 2 = 2n - 1

We need to find the value of \(n\) for which \(a_n = 2003\). Therefore, we set up the equation:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the interior of the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that satisfy the conditions for being inside the rectangle.

The rectangle spans from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). However, since we are looking for points strictly within the interior, we exclude the boundary points. Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates must satisfy \(-5 < x < 5\), and the \(y\)-coordinates must satisfy \(-4 < y < 4\).

The integer values for \(x\) that satisfy \(-5 < x < 5\) are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

and

\[

We can further distribute each term:

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar triangles by the Angle Bisector Theorem. This means that the ratio of the corresponding sides of these triangles is equal. Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{CD}{CD + AB}
\]
However, since \(CD = h\) and \(AB\) is the other base of the trapezoid, we can simplify this to:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{h}{h + AB}
\]
Since \(AB\) is not directly given, we can use the area of the trapezoid to find a relationship between \(a\), \(b\), and \(h\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b)h = 84
\]

Now, let's find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

We need to express \(h\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\). From the similarity of the triangles, we have:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{h}{h + AB}
\]
Since \(AB\) is not directly given, we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AB = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times AB
\]
The total area of the trapezoid is:
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times AB = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Let \([\triangle ACD] = x\). Then \([\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} x\). Substituting these into the area equation, we get:
\[
x + \frac{b}{a} x = 42
\]
\[
x \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{a + b}
\]
Since \(a + b = \frac{84}{h}\), we have:
\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{\frac{84}{h}} = 42 \times \frac{a \times h}{84} = \frac{42 \times a \times h}{84} = \frac{a \times h}{2}
\]
Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
Since we already know that \((a + b)h = 84\), we can use the fact that the area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), and the ratio of their areas is the ratio of their bases. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid because the height is the same and the base \(a\) is half of the sum of the bases \(a + b\) when considering the angle bisector. Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation. We substitute \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{18}}{\sqrt{8}} = \frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2\sqrt{2}} = \frac{3}{2}

Let's start by identifying the values:
- For \(\frac{7}{30}\), \(m = 7\) and \(n = 30\).
- For \(\frac{10}{21}\), \(p = 10\) and \(q = 21\).

Now, substitute these values into the operation formula:

\[

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must appear in the order \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (or any cyclic permutation of these orders).

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (the number of ways to rotate the circle) to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting (the orders \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\)). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the combined area of the shaded regions in the two circles is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the combined area of the shaded regions is:
\[
\text{Combined area of the shaded regions} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine the area of the shaded region in each circle separately. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the central angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians.

### Area of the shaded region in the smaller circle
The area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi \times (1)^2 = \frac{\theta}{2}

The area of the shaded region in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Shaded area in the larger circle} = \text{Area of the sector} - \text{Area of the triangle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta) = 2(\theta - \sin(\theta))

### Combined area of the shaded regions
The combined area of the shaded regions in both circles is:
\[
\text{Combined area of the shaded regions} = \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin(\theta)) + 2(\theta - \sin(\theta)) = \frac{1}{2} (\theta - \sin(\theta)) + \frac{4}{2} (\theta - \sin(\theta)) = \frac{5}{2} (\theta - \sin(\theta))

We know this combined area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):

"To determine how many cylindrical mugs are needed to fill a spherical cistern, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical mug and the spherical cistern, and then find the ratio of the volume of the cistern to the volume of the mug.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mug. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical cistern. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical cistern, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical mugs are required to fill the spherical cistern. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical cistern by the volume of the cylindrical mug:

"To find the value of \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.
\]
Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta).
\]
This expression is a difference of squares:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2.

We know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\), and similarly, \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2 = \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}.

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[

This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., subcommittees with only Republicans or only Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 republicans and 6 Democrats):

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Republicans. Since there are 8 republicans, the number of ways to choose 5 Republicans is:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5!3!} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee with only Democrats. Since there are 6 Democrats, the number of ways to choose 5 Democrats is:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\), so:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
Since \(BC = 2BM = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2}\), we substitute \(BC\) into the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and the properties of the triangle. By symmetry and trigonometric identities, we find that \(\theta = 30^\circ\). Therefore:
\[
AB = AC = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + \left(\frac{2 \cdot 11 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{121 + 333} = \sqrt{454} = 11\sqrt{3}
\]
The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{3} + 11\sqrt{3} + 2 \cdot 11 \sqrt{3} = 44\sqrt{3}

"To find the median of the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers that equals \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers is then \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of these 27 consecutive integers can be expressed as:
\[
a + (a+1) + (a+2) + \cdots + (a+26)
\]
This is an arithmetic series with the first term \(a\), the last term \(a+26\), and the number of terms 27. The sum \(S\) of an arithmetic series is given by:
\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
Substituting the values, we get:
\[
3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a+26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
2187 = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real \(x\). So, this part of the inequality does not restrict the values of \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \pm\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which gives us:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by using the given equations and some algebraic identities. The equations are:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use another identity to express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]

Now, let's denote \(x+y+z\) by \(s\) and \(xy + yz + zx\) by \(p\). The equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

We also know from the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) into this equation, we get:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(sp = 24\), we get:
\[
4p = 24,
\]
so
\[
p = 6.

"To determine which razred has the number of male bus riders closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders for each razred and then compare it to the number of male bus riders.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders for each razred. Since there are 300 female bus riders in each razred, we have:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 300 = 1.35 \times 300 = 405 \]

Now, we will compare the number of male bus riders in each razred to 405.

1. For the \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred:
   - Number of male bus riders: \(41.1\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 123.3 = 281.7\)

2. For the \(10^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred:
   - Number of male bus riders: \(34.4\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 103.2 = 301.8\)

3. For the \(11^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred:
   - Number of male bus riders: \(20.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)

4. For the \(12^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred:
   - Number of male bus riders: \(11.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 34.8 = 370.2\)

The smallest difference is 281.7, which corresponds to the \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred. Therefore, the number of male bus riders in the \(9^{\mathrm{th}}\) razred is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus riders.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:
\[|x^2 - 81| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-\infty, -9) \cup (9, \infty), \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \in (-9, 9).
\end{cases}\]

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

We need to find the intervals where the quotient \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative. We will consider each case for the numerator and the denominator separately.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:

   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight rubos and two semicircles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

First, let's denote the length of the rectangular field by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The two straight rubos each have a length equal to the width \( w \) of the rectangle. The two semicircles each have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The circumference of a full circle with radius \( r \) is given by \( 2\pi r \). Therefore, the circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi r \). Since the radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \), the circumference of one semicircle is:
\[
\pi \left( \frac{w}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi w}{2}
\]

Since there are two semicircles, the total length of the semicircles is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight rubos and the two semicircles:
\[
2w + \pi w = (2 + \pi)w
\]

We know that the total length of the track is 400 meters, so we can set up the following equation:
\[
(2 + \pi)w = 400
\]

To find the width \( w \), we solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 2 + \pi \):
\[
w = \frac{400}{2 + \pi}
\]

Next, we need to find the length \( l \) of the rectangle. The length \( l \) is given by the length of the straight rubos, which is \( l \). However, we need to express \( l \) in terms of \( w \). Since the track is a closed path around the rectangle, the length \( l \) is not directly given by the track length equation. Instead, we use the fact that the track length equation already includes the straight rubos.

To find the area \( A \) of the rectangle, we use the formula:
\[
A = l \times w
\]

Since \( l \) is not directly given, we need to express \( l \) in terms of \( w \). However, we can use the fact that the track length equation already includes the straight rubos. Therefore, we need to find the area of the rectangle in terms of \( w \).

Finally, we use the given track length equation to find the area of the rectangle. The area of the rectangle is:
\[
A = l \times w = w \times w = w^2

We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\). In a right triangle, the sine of an angle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\) and the side opposite angle \(R\) is \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression \( x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). Let \( u = x^2 \). Then the expression becomes a quadratic function in terms of \( u \):

\[
f(u) = u^2 - 4u + 9
\]

This is a quadratic function in the form \( f(u) = au^2 + bu + c \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -4 \), and \( c = 9 \). The minimum value of a quadratic function occurs at \( u = -\frac{b}{2a} \):

\[
u = -\frac{-4}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
\]

Substitute \( u = 2 \) back into the function \( f(u) \):

\[
f(2) = 2^2 - 4 \cdot 2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

Thus, the minimum value of \( x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum value of \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The minimum distance is expressed as \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Therefore, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]
 So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices and 12 edges, and it can be visualized as two pyramids with a square base joined at their bases.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) such that \(A, B, C, D\) form a square in the \(xy\)-plane and \(E\) and \(F\) are the vertices above and below the center of the square, respectively. The coordinates of the vertices can be taken as follows:
- \(A = (1, 1, 0)\)
- \(B = (-1, 1, 0)\)
- \(C = (-1, -1, 0)\)
- \(D = (1, -1, 0)\)
- \(E = (0, 0, 1)\)
- \(F = (0, 0, -1)\)

Let the coordinates of point \(P\) be \((x, y, z)\). The distances from \(P\) to the vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex, which is \(F = (0, 0, -1)\).

The distance from \(P\) to any vertex can be calculated using the distance formula:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x - x_1)^2 + (y - y_1)^2 + (z - z_1)^2}
\]

We will use the given distances to set up equations. Let's assume the distances to \(A, B, C, D, E\) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11 in some order. We need to find the distance to \(F\).

First, we write the equations for the distances to \(A, B, C, D\):
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]

We square each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 49
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]
\[
(x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second, third, and fourth equations to eliminate \(z^2\):
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2 = 55
\]
\[
4x + 4y = 55
\]
\[
4(10) + 4y = 55
\]
\[
40 + 4y = 55
\]
\[
4y = 15
\]
\[
y = \frac{15}{4}
\]

\[
(x - 1)^2 - (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2 = 81 - 9
\]
\[
(x - 1)^2 - (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2 - (y - 1)^2 = 72
\]
\[
-4x + 4y = 72
\]
\[
-4(10) + 4y = 72
\]
\[
-40 + 4y = 72
\]
\[
4y = 112
\]
\[
y = 28
\]

We have a contradiction in the value of \(y\). Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Given the symmetry and properties of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to its vertices is constant.

Given the distances to five vertices, we can use the property:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2)
\]

where \(a, b, c\) are the edge lengths of the octahedron. For a regular octahedron with edge length \(a\), the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices is:
\[
4(a^2 + b^2 + c^2) = 4 \times 3a^2 = 12a^2
\]

Given the distances 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we calculate:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Let \(d_6\) be the distance from \(P\) to \(F\). Then:
\[
324 + d_6^2 = 4a^2
\]

Since \(a = 2\), we have:
\[
4a^2 = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

Thus:
\[
d_6^2 = 16
\]
\[
d_6 = \sqrt{16}
\]
\[
d_6 = 4
\]

Therefore, the distance from \(P\) to the sixth vertex is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",\sqrt{66},[],False
"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the softball with the same force as Jack throws the baseball, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softball}} = F_{\text{baseball}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each object, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softball}} \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = m_{\text{baseball}} \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

We know the masses of the softball and the baseball:
\[ m_{\text{softball}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{baseball}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softball}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseball}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softball to the acceleration of the baseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softball}}}{a_{\text{baseball}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's baseball is:

"To determine how many common digits are in the representations of the number \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8, we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both bases.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
The digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. There are 3 common digits.

   - There are 10čarobnyakas.

2. **Determine the handshakes between vješice andčarobnyakas:**
   - Each vješica shakes hands with eachčarobnyakas.

     \[
     6 \text{ vješice} \times 10 \text{čarobnyakas} = 60 \text{ handshakes}

3. **Determine the handshakes among the vješice:**

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). The standard form is:

\[
2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10

So the numerator is \(|10| = 10\). Now, simplify the denominator:

From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\).

2. The cost of one olovka and one velika gumica is \$1.82:

\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274
\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). In this decimal, the digits to the right of the decimal point are 2, 7, and 4. The last non-zero digit is 4.

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\). The center \(O\) of the rectangle is at the origin \((0, 0)\).

A point \((x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A = (-a, b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B = (a, b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C = (a, -b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle:
1. \(ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
2. \(ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
3. \(ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
4. \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

The intersection of these regions forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of smaller rectangle} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \times \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of original rectangle} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}
\]

Given \(k = \frac{a}{b}\), we substitute \(a = kb\):
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4(kb)^2} = \frac{k^2b^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4k^2b^2} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}}

First, we perform the division:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
The quotient is 9. Now, we can express 54 as:
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + 0\]
Here, the remainder \(r\) is 0. Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is:

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, is left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie convert their kopecks into dollars, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert each person's kopecks to dollars:**
   - Linda: \( \$27.47 \)
   - Sherry: \( \$35.23 \)
   - June: \( \$37.37 \)
   - Connie: \( \$26.52 \)

2. **Sum the amounts in dollars:**
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

3. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   - First, add Linda and Sherry's amounts:
     \[
     27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
     \]
   - Next, add June's amount to the result:
     \[
     62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
     \]
   - Finally, add Connie's amount to the result:
     \[
     100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
     \]

4. **Determine the total amount in cents:**
   - Since \( \$126.59 \) is equivalent to \( 12659 \) cents (because \( 1 \) dollar = \( 100 \) cents), we need to find the remainder when \( 12659 \) is divided by \( 100 \):
     \[
     12659 \mod 100 = 59

Therefore, the amount of money left after converting the kopecks into dollars is \(\boxed{59}\) cents.","[59, '59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total sum of all the scores and then divide that sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score for each group of students:
- The 20 students who scored 80 points have a total score of \(20 \times 80 = 1600\) points.
- The 8 students who scored 90 points have a total score of \(8 \times 90 = 720\) points.
- The 2 students who scored 100 points have a total score of \(2 \times 100 = 200\) points.

Next, we add up all these total scores to get the overall total score for the class:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

Now, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score:
\[2520 \div 30 = 84\]

Therefore, the average score of the class is \(\boxed{84}\).","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sums of the numbers in the third row, the columns, and the diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the numbers in the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 14 - 9 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-3) = 8 + 5 + 4 = 15
\]

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Jim walks than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim covers. Jim walks diagonally across the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} \]

Substituting the given values (length = 400 feet and width = 300 feet):
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim covers 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha covers. Martha walks along the length and the width of the field, so she covers the length plus the width:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{length} + \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha covers 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference in the distances covered by Jim and Martha:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance covered by Martha} - \text{Distance covered by Jim} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Jim walks \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real root.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega^3 = 1\) implies \(\omega^3 - 1 = 0\), which can be factored as:
\[
\omega^3 - 1 = (\omega - 1)(\omega^2 + \omega + 1) = 0.
\]
Since \(\omega \neq 1\), it follows that \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 + (-1) = 1.
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.

"To determine the shortest distance that can be traveled by starting at any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum of these distances.

Let's consider each starting point and calculate the total distance for all possible routes.

**Starting at point \(A\):**
1. Route \(A \to B \to C \to D\):
   \[
   AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
2. Route \(A \to B \to D \to C\):
   \[
   AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13
   \]
3. Route \(A \to C \to B \to D\):
   \[
   AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
4. Route \(A \to C \to D \to B\):
   \[
   AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
   \]
5. Route \(A \to D \to B \to C\):
   \[
   AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
6. Route \(A \to D \to C \to B\):
   \[
   AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]

The minimum distance starting at \(A\) is 13.

**Starting at point \(B\):**
1. Route \(B \to A \to C \to D\):
   \[
   BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16
   \]
2. Route \(B \to A \to D \to C\):
   \[
   BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15
   \]
3. Route \(B \to C \to A \to D\):
   \[
   BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \(B \to C \to D \to A\):
   \[
   BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14
   \]
5. Route \(B \to D \to A \to C\):
   \[
   BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
6. Route \(B \to D \to C \to A\):
   \[
   BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting at \(B\) is 13.

**Starting at point \(C\):**
1. Route \(C \to A \to B \to D\):
   \[
   CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15
   \]
2. Route \(C \to A \to D \to B\):
   \[
   CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14
   \]
3. Route \(C \to B \to A \to D\):
   \[
   CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
4. Route \(C \to B \to D \to A\):
   \[
   CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
   \]
5. Route \(C \to D \to A \to B\):
   \[
   CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]
6. Route \(C \to D \to B \to A\):
   \[
   CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13
   \]

The minimum distance starting at \(C\) is 13.

**Starting at point \(D\):**
1. Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\):
   \[
   DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
2. Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\):
   \[
   DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16
   \]
3. Route \(D \to B \to A \to C\):
   \[
   DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15
   \]
4. Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\):
   \[
   DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14
   \]
5. Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\):
   \[
   DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16
   \]
6. Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\):
   \[
   DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
   \]

The minimum distance starting at \(D\) is 14.

From the calculations above, the shortest distance that can be traveled by starting at any of the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visiting the other three points exactly once is \(\boxed{13}\).","[13, '13']",13,"[13, '13']",True
