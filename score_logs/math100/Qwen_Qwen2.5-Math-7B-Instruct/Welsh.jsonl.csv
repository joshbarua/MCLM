"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) such that \( z \) is rotated \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise around \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Express the rotation as a complex multiplication:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise around a point \( c \) can be achieved by first translating \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin, then rotating the result by \( \theta \), and finally translating back to the original position. Mathematically, this is given by:
   \[
   w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta}
   \]
   Here, \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) + i\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

2. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

3. **Rotate \( z - c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \):**
   \[
   (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can use the distributive property to expand this product:
   \[
   (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

4. **Translate back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine how many bobl eistered by Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the total number of bobl eistered by all three.
2. Determine how many bobl eistered by each individual.

From the problem, we know:
- The total number of bobl eistered is 8.
- Pierre eistered 3 bobl.
- Rosa eistered 3 bobl.
- Thomas eistered the remaining bobl.

First, we calculate the total number of bobl eistered by Pierre and Rosa:
\[ 3 \text{ (Pierre)} + 3 \text{ (Rosa)} = 6 \text{ bobl} \]

Next, we subtract the number of bobl eistered by Pierre and Rosa from the total number of bobl eistered to find out how many bobl eistered by Thomas:
\[ 8 \text{ (total)} - 6 \text{ (Pierre and Rosa)} = 2 \text{ bobl} \]

"To find the coefficient of the \(x^5\) term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). We need to find the term in the expansion that contains \(x^5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to determine the value of \(k\) such that the exponent of \(x\) in this term is 5. The exponent of \(x\) in \((10x^3)^{5-k}\) is \(3(5-k)\), and the exponent of \(x\) in \(\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k\) is \(-2k\). Therefore, the total exponent of \(x\) in the term is:

\[
3(5-k) - 2k = 15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to 5 to find \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 5
\]

Solving for \(k\), we get:

\[
15 - 5 = 5k \implies 10 = 5k \implies k = 2
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 2\) into the general term to find the coefficient of the \(x^5\) term:

\[
\binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^{5-2} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = \binom{5}{2} (10x^3)^3 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2
\]

We calculate each part separately:

\[
\binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^3 = 10^3 (x^3)^3 = 1000x^9
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^2 = \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 (x^{-2})^2 = \frac{1}{4} x^{-4}
\]

Combining these, we get:

\[
10 \cdot 1000x^9 \cdot \frac{1}{4} x^{-4} = 10 \cdot 1000 \cdot \frac{1}{4} \cdot x^{9-4} = 10 \cdot 250 \cdot x^5 = 2500x^5

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to determine the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Now, substitute these congruences back into the original expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[

\[

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we set this equal to the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[

\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Since \(x > 7\) is satisfied, we can find \(x + y\):
\[

First, recall the definition of the tangent function:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\sin A}{\cos A}
\]
We are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). Substituting this into the tangent formula, we get:

"To determine the asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze both the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but with a slight modification. Instead of \(99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot 1 + 1^2\), we have \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). However, we can still use a similar approach by recognizing that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

This is a known algebraic identity for the sum of a geometric series. The expression \(100^3 - 1\) can be factored as:
\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1) = 99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1).\]

By dividing both sides of the equation by 99, we get:
\[100^2 + 100 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

Since \(100^3 = 1000000\), we have:
\[100^2 + 100 + 1 = \frac{1000000 - 1}{99} = \frac{999999}{99} = 10101.\]

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{10101}\).","[10101, '10101']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False
"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for any vector \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we start by computing the left-hand side of the inequality. The matrix-vector product is given by

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to find the smallest \( C \) such that

\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le C \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides of the inequality, we get

\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le C^2 (x^2 + y^2).
\]

Rearranging terms, we have

\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 - C^2 x^2 - C^2 y^2 \le 0,
\]

which simplifies to

\[
(4 - C^2)x^2 + 12xy + (13 - C^2)y^2 \le 0.
\]

For this inequality to hold for all \( x \) and \( y \), the quadratic form \((4 - C^2)x^2 + 12xy + (13 - C^2)y^2\) must be negative semi-definite. This means that the discriminant of the quadratic form must be non-positive. The discriminant \(\Delta\) of the quadratic form \(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2\) is given by \(b^2 - 4ac\). Here, \(a = 4 - C^2\), \(b = 12\), and \(c = 13 - C^2\), so the discriminant is

\[
12^2 - 4(4 - C^2)(13 - C^2) = 144 - 4(52 - 17C^2 + C^4) = 144 - 208 + 68C^2 - 4C^4 = -64 + 68C^2 - 4C^4.
\]

Setting the discriminant less than or equal to zero, we get

\[
-4C^4 + 68C^2 - 64 \le 0.
\]

Dividing through by -4 (and reversing the inequality sign), we have

\[
C^4 - 17C^2 + 16 \ge 0.
\]

Let \( u = C^2 \). Then the inequality becomes

\[
u^2 - 17u + 16 \ge 0.
\]

We solve the quadratic equation \(u^2 - 17u + 16 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(u = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = -17\), and \(c = 16\):

\[
u = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 64}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{225}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm 15}{2}.
\]

This gives us the solutions \(u = 16\) and \(u = 1\). Therefore, the inequality \(u^2 - 17u + 16 \ge 0\) holds for \(u \le 1\) or \(u \ge 16\). Since \(u = C^2\) and \(C\) is a positive real number, we have \(C^2 \ge 16\) or \(C \ge 4\). The smallest possible value for \(C\) is 4.

To confirm that \(C = 4\) works, we substitute \(C = 4\) back into the inequality:

\[
\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2} \le 4 \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.
\]

Squaring both sides, we get

\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 \le 16(x^2 + y^2),
\]

which simplifies to

\[
4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2 - 16x^2 - 16y^2 \le 0,
\]

or

\[
-12x^2 + 12xy - 3y^2 \le 0,

which is equivalent to

\[
-3(4x^2 - 4xy + y^2) \le 0,
\]

or

\[
4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 \ge 0.
\]

Since \(4x^2 - 4xy + y^2 = (2x - y)^2 \ge 0\) for all \(x\) and \(y\), the inequality holds. Therefore, the smallest positive real number \(C\) is

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

     - \(9^2 = 81\) (which is greater than 36, so we use \(9^1\) and \(9^0\))
     - \(9^1 = 9\)

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}

"To solve the problem, let's define the variables for the number of pencils each person has:
- Let \( p \) be the number of pencils Mae deg treek.
- Let \( q \) be the number of pencils Mae deg squig.
- Let \( r \) be the number of pencils Mae deg goolee.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Mae deg treek yn pwyso cymaint â thri squig ac un goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   p = 3q + r
   \]
2. Mae deg treek ac un goolee yn hafal o ran pwysau i un squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   p + r = q
   \]
3. Mae pwysau cyfansawdd sawl treekyn hafal i bwysau un squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   p + q = r
   \]

We now have a system of three equations:
1. \( p = 3q + r \)
2. \( p + r = q \)
3. \( p + q = r \)

First, let's substitute the expression for \( p \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
(3q + r) + r = q
\]
Simplify this equation:
\[
3q + 2r = q
\]
Subtract \( q \) from both sides:
\[
2q + 2r = 0
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
q + r = 0
\]
This implies:
\[
r = -q
\]

Next, substitute \( r = -q \) into the third equation:
\[
p + q = -q
\]
Add \( q \) to both sides:
\[
p + 2q = 0
\]
This implies:
\[
p = -2q
\]

Now we have \( p = -2q \) and \( r = -q \). Substitute \( p = -2q \) and \( r = -q \) back into the first equation to verify:
\[
-2q = 3q + (-q)
\]
Simplify the right side:
\[
-2q = 3q - q
\]
\[
-2q = 2q
\]

"To solve for \(a\) and \(b\) in the given polynomial equation, we start by equating the coefficients of the corresponding terms on both sides of the equation. The given equation is:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

First, we expand the left-hand side of the equation:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2(4t^2 + bt - 2) + 5t(4t^2 + bt - 2) + a(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

This expands to:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Combining like terms, we get:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We now compare the coefficients of the expanded form with the coefficients of the right-hand side of the original equation, which is \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). This gives us the following system of equations:

1. \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

From the fifth equation, we solve for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the second equation to solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now that we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), we can find \(a + b\):

"To find the radius of the tandy, we start by using the formula for the circumference of a circle, which is given by:

where \( C \) is the circumference and \( r \) is the radius. According to the problem, the circumference of the tandy is \( 20\pi \) meters. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[ 2\pi r = 20\pi \]

To solve for \( r \), we divide both sides of the equation by \( 2\pi \):

\[ r = \frac{20\pi}{2\pi} = 10 \]

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects the line \(y = x\) at exactly one point, we need to analyze the function \(f(x)\) and the line \(y = x\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

We need to find the value of \(a\) such that the equation \(f(x) = x\) has exactly one solution. This means we need to solve the equation \(ax^2 = x\) for \(x \geq a\) and the equation \(ax + 2a = x\) for \(x < a\), and ensure that there is exactly one solution in total.

First, consider the equation \(ax^2 = x\) for \(x \geq a\):
\[ ax^2 - x = 0 \]
\[ x(ax - 1) = 0 \]
This gives us two solutions: \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{1}{a}\). For \(x = 0\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x \geq a\), so \(0 \geq a\). For \(x = \frac{1}{a}\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(\frac{1}{a} \geq a\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{1}{a} - a \geq 0 \]
\[ \frac{1 - a^2}{a} \geq 0 \]
This inequality holds when \(a\) is in the interval \([-1, 0)\).

Next, consider the equation \(ax + 2a = x\) for \(x < a\):
\[ ax - x = -2a \]
\[ x(a - 1) = -2a \]
This gives us one solution: \(x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}\). For \(x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}\) to be a valid solution, it must satisfy \(x < a\), so \(\frac{-2a}{a - 1} < a\). This inequality can be rewritten as:
\[ \frac{-2a}{a - 1} - a < 0 \]
\[ \frac{-2a - a(a - 1)}{a - 1} < 0 \]
\[ \frac{-2a - a^2 + a}{a - 1} < 0 \]
\[ \frac{-a^2 - a}{a - 1} < 0 \]
\[ \frac{-a(a + 1)}{a - 1} < 0 \]
This inequality holds when \(a\) is in the intervals \((-1, 0)\) or \((1, \infty)\).

To have exactly one solution, we need to consider the overlap of the intervals where each piece of the function can provide a solution. The interval \([-1, 0)\) from the first piece and the interval \((-1, 0)\) from the second piece overlap in the interval \((-1, 0)\). However, at \(a = -1\), the solution \(x = \frac{-2a}{a - 1}\) is undefined, so \(a = -1\) is not a valid solution. Therefore, the only value of \(a\) that ensures exactly one solution is \(a = 0\).

When \(a = 0\), the function \(f(x)\) becomes:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } x \geq 0,\\
0 & \text{if } x < 0.
\end{cases}
\]
In this case, \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x\), and the line \(y = x\) intersects the graph of \(f(x)\) at exactly one point, which is \((0, 0)\).

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the given equation of the circle \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

### Completing the square for \( x \):
1. Start with the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 25 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (x - 5)^2 - 25
   \]

### Completing the square for \( y \):
1. Start with the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \( 6 \), divide by 2 to get \( 3 \), and then square it to get \( 9 \).
3. Add and subtract \( 9 \) inside the equation:
   \[
   y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9
   \]
4. This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   (y + 3)^2 - 9
   \]

### Substitute back into the original equation:
Now, substitute the completed squares back into the original equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \):
\[
(x - 5)^2 - 25 + (y + 3)^2 - 9 + c = 0
\]

### Combine like terms:
Combine the constant terms \(-25\) and \(-9\):
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 - 34 + c = 0
\]

### Isolate the completed squares:
Add \( 34 \) to both sides of the equation to isolate the completed squares:
\[
(x - 5)^2 + (y + 3)^2 = 34 - c
\]

### Set the equation equal to the radius squared:
We know the radius \( r \) is 1, so \( r^2 = 1^2 = 1 \). Set the right-hand side of the equation equal to 1:
\[
34 - c = 1
\]

### Solve for \( c \):
Subtract 34 from both sides to solve for \( c \):
\[
-c = 1 - 34
\]
\[
-c = -33
\]
\[
c = 33
\]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To solve for the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) for some \(x \in [0,1]\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(x) \neq x\), \(x\) must not be 0 or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that \(f(f(x)) = x\) for some \(x \in [0,1]\) and \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

First, we compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We set \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

Since we are looking for \(x \neq 0\), we focus on the second case:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \lambda \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2\right) - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - (\lambda - 1) + \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = \lambda \left(1 - \lambda + 1 + \frac{\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = \lambda \left(2 - \lambda + \lambda - 2 + \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is indeed a solution. To find other solutions, we need to solve the cubic equation:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \(\pm 1\) and \(\pm \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\). Testing \(x = 1\), we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 (1)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(1)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)(1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^4 - \lambda^2 - \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^3 - 1.
\]
For \(x = 1\) to be a root, \(\lambda^3 - 1 = 0\), so \(\lambda = 1\). However, if \(\lambda = 1\), then \(f(x) = x\) for all \(x \in [0,1]\), so there are no solutions to \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\).

Next, we test \(x = -1\), but since \(x \in [0,1]\), \(x = -1\) is not a valid solution.

Finally, we test \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\):
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)\left(\frac{1}{\lambda^2}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda^6} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda^4} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{1}{\lambda^2} + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\frac{1}{\lambda^2} + \frac{2\lambda + \lambda^2}{\lambda^2} - (1 + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\frac{1}{\lambda^2} + \frac{2}{\lambda} + 1 - 1 - \lambda + \lambda^2 - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda + \frac{2}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} - 1.
\]
For \(x = \frac{1}{\lambda^2}\) to be a root, \(\lambda^2 - \lambda + \frac{2}{\lambda} - \frac{1}{\lambda^2} - 1 = 0\). Multiplying through by \(\lambda^2\), we get:
\[
\lambda^4 - \lambda^3 + 2\lambda - 1 - \lambda^2 = 0 \implies \lambda^4 - \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 2\lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
By the Rational Root Theorem, possible rational roots are \(\pm 1\). Testing \(\lambda = 2\), we get:
\[
2^4 - 2^3 - 2^2 + 2 \cdot 2 - 1 = 16 - 8 - 4 + 4 - 1 = 7 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \(\lambda = 3\), we get:
\[
3^4 - 3^3 - 3^2 + 2 \cdot 3 - 1 = 81 - 27 - 9 + 6 - 1 = 40 \neq 0.
\]
 testing \(\lambda = 4\), we get:
\[
4^4 - 4^3 - 4^2 + 2 \cdot 4 - 1 = 256 - 64 - 16 + 8 - 1 = 183 \neq 0.
\]
 testing \(\lambda = 2\), we get:
\[
\lambda^4 - \lambda^3 - \lambda^2 + 2\lambda - 1 = 2^4 - 2^3 - 2^2 + 2 \cdot [

"To solve the given expression for \(\theta\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Again, we can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
To simplify this, we can use the tangent addition formula in a different form. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]
However, a simpler approach is to use the tangent of a sum formula in reverse. We can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ}.
\]
This is the same form as the tangent of a sum formula in reverse. Therefore, we can use the tangent of a sum formula in reverse to find that:
\[
\tan \theta = \tan 40^\circ.
\]
Thus, \(\theta = 40^\circ\).

"To solve the problem of finding the equation of the ellipse given the foci and the length of the major axis, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the coordinates of the foci and the length of the major axis.
2. Determine the center of the ellipse.
3. Calculate the distance between the foci (which is \(2c\)).
4. Use the length of the major axis to find \(a\).
5. Use the relationship \(c^2 = a^2 - b^2\) to find \(b\).
6. Write the equation of the ellipse in standard form.

Let's assume the foci are at \((\pm c, 0)\) and the length of the major axis is \(2a\). The standard form of the equation of an ellipse centered at the origin with a horizontal major axis is:

\[
\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1
\]

For this problem, let's assume the foci are at \((\pm 3, 0)\) and the length of the major axis is 10. This means \(c = 3\) and \(2a = 10\), so \(a = 5\).

Next, we use the relationship \(c^2 = a^2 - b^2\) to find \(b\):

\[
3^2 = 5^2 - b^2
\]
\[
9 = 25 - b^2
\]
\[
b^2 = 25 - 9

\[
b^2 = 16

\[
\frac{x^2}{25} + \frac{y^2}{16} = 1

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior at the boundary points and within the domain.

First, consider the boundary points where \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \):
- If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).
- If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \).
- If \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).
- If \( y = -1 \), then \( f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, -1) = -1 \).

Next, we consider the interior points where \( -1 < x < 1 \) and \( -1 < y < 1 \). To find the critical points, we take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) and set them to zero:
\[ f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0, \]
\[ f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0. \]

From \( f_x = 0 \), we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}, \]
\[ 1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2}, \]
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2, \]
\[ 1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0, \]

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can parameterize \( x \) and \( y \) as \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function, we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1. \]

Therefore, the value of the function on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1. Since this is the highest value we have found on the boundary and within the domain, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}
\]

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the area of the triangle \(OAB\) is \(\boxed{3\sqrt{5}}\).","[3*sqrt(5), '3\\sqrt{5}']",3 \sqrt{5},"[3, '3']",False
"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \( z \) in polar form. Let \( z = re^{i\theta} \). Then \( \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1}{r} e^{-i\theta} \). Since \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi \) is a real number, \( r \) must be 1 (because the magnitudes of \( z \) and \( \frac{1}{z} \) must cancel each other out in the imaginary part). Thus, \( z = e^{i\theta} \) and \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \). This gives us:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Therefore,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Thus, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i(85\pi/5)} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i(85\pi/5)} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \( G \) of a triangle and the line passing through it parallel to one of its sides. The centroid \( G \) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that \( AD \), \( BE \), and \( CF \) are the medians of triangle \( ABC \) and they intersect at the centroid \( G \), we know that \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. This means that \( AG = \frac{2}{3}AD \), \( BG = \frac{2}{3}BE \), and \( CG = \frac{2}{3}CF \).

The line passing through \( G \) parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangle \( AMN \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid \( G \) to the sides of the triangle to the distances from the vertices to the sides of the triangle. Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the height from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height from \( A \) to \( BC \). Therefore, the similarity ratio of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area ratio of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

Given that the area of triangle \( ABC \) is 144, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64
\]

Since \( MN \parallel BC \) and \( G \) is the centroid, triangle \( Engel \) is congruent to triangle \( AMN \) (by the properties of the centroid and the parallel line). Therefore, the area of triangle \( Engel \) is also 64.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is divisible by \( n^{\text{th}} \), we start by considering the prime factorization of \( 2^{24} \).

For \( 2^{24} \) to be divisible by \( 2^{kn} \), it must be true that \( kn \leq 24 \). Since \( n = 2^k \), we substitute \( n \) with \( 2^k \) to get \( k \cdot 2^k \leq 24 \).

We now check the values of \( k \) to find the largest integer \( k \) that satisfies this inequality:
- For \( k = 1 \), \( k \cdot 2^k = 1 \cdot 2^1 = 2 \leq 24 \).

The value of the dimes can be expressed as \( 10d \) cents (since each dime is worth 10 cents), and the value of the nickels can be expressed as \( 5n \) cents (since each nickel is worth 5 cents). According to the problem, the total value of the coins is 75 cents, so we can write the equation:

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

This equation tells us that the number of nickels \( n \) is equal to 15 minus twice the number of dimes \( d \). Since \( d \) and \( n \) must be non-negative integers, we need to find a value for \( d \) that makes \( n \) a non-negative integer. Let's test some possible values for \( d \):

- If \( d = 0 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 0 = 15 \).
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 1 = 13 \).
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 2 = 11 \).
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 3 = 9 \).
- If \( d = 4 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 4 = 7 \).
- If \( d = 5 \), then \( n = 15 - 2 \cdot 5 = 5 \).

The grid is a 3x4 grid, meaning it has 3 rows and 4 columns. Beth starts at the top-left corner (0, 4) and wants to reach the bottom-right corner (3, 0). She can only move down or to the right.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of moves required:**
   - To move from (0, 4) to (3, 0), Beth needs to make 3 moves to the right (R) and 4 moves down (D).
   - Therefore, the total number of moves is \(3 + 4 = 7\).

"To determine the probability that the Gwenir ar the square cysodol of the bqrdd Gwenir will be placed in the square cysodol of the bqrdd Gwenir, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 possible positions for the Gwenir on the grid (one for each row).
   - There are 4 possible positions for the Gwenir on the grid (one for each column).
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is \(4 \times 4 = 16\).

2. **Identify the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - There is only 1 favorable outcome where the Gwenir is placed in the square cysodol of the bqrdd Gwenir.

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability \(P\) of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability that the Gwenir will be placed in the square cysodol of the bqrdd Gwenir is \(\frac{1}{16}\).

Thus, the probability that the Gwenir will be placed in the square cysodol of the bqrdd Gwenir is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{16}}\).","[1/16, '\\frac{1}{16}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To determine the number of digits in the decimal expansion of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Thus, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This gives us \(0.00021605\). To count the number of digits in the decimal expansion, we observe that \(0.00021605\) has 8 digits in total (including the leading zeros).

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

In this case, let \(x = 20^\circ\). Then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin (60^\circ - 20^\circ) \sin (60^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin (3 \cdot 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape of the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

1. **Cylindrical Coordinates**: In cylindrical coordinates, a point in space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
   - \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis.
   - \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane.
   - \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

2. **Equation \( z = c \)**: The equation \( z = c \) means that for any point on this surface, the \( z \)-coordinate is a constant value \( c \). This implies that the surface is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions.

3. **Shape of the Surface**: Since \( z \) is constant, the surface is a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions, forming a flat, two-dimensional surface.

Therefore, the shape of the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is:

\[
\theta = \sin^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 30^\circ

Therefore, the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is \(\boxed{30}\) degrees.","[30, '30']",30^\circ,"[30, '30']",True
"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by recalling that the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). This means that the roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x + 5) = 0 \). If \( r \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( x + 5 = s \) where \( s \) is a root of \( f(x) \). Therefore, the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( s - 5 \) where \( s \) is a root of \( f(x) \).

The sum of the roots of a polynomial \( f(x) = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\). For the polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), the sum of the roots is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]
Let the roots of \( f(x) \) be \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \). Then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Since \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.
\]

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\). Squaring both sides of the equation \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ) = (3\sqrt{3})^2\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(-\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}) = 27,

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 6 + \frac{2}{\tan^2 10^\circ} = 27,

\]

Since \(\tan^2 80^\circ = \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + 2 + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
4 + 2(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ) - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
2(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ) - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 29,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - \sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 14.5.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
2 + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 14.5,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 14.5 - 2 = 12.5.
\]

Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 12.5.
\]

Finally, we substitute this back into our expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 12.5 = 15.5.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}

Next, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = 5.9444\ldots

Since \(n-2\) must be an integer (because \(n\) is the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\ldots\) to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

"To determine the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]
we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found by determining the perpendicular distance from a point on one line to the other line. We can use the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and find the perpendicular distance to the second line.

The vector from the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) to a point on the second line is given by
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The distance between the two lines is the length of the projection of this vector onto a vector perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. The direction vector of the lines is \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), so we need to find the cross product of \(\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

The cross product is calculated as follows:
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix} \times \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2).
\]
Simplifying each component, we get:
\[
\mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14) = \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58) = \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]
The magnitude of this vector is:
\[
\sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]
The magnitude of the direction vector \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) is:
\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]
The distance between the two lines is the magnitude of the cross product divided by the magnitude of the direction vector:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]
Therefore, the distance between the two lines is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine which point does not lie within the rectangle defined by the vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to check the coordinates of each point to see if they fall within the range of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the rectangle.

The x-coordinates of the rectangle range from \(-5\) to \(5\), and the y-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\). Therefore, a point \((x,y)\) lies within the rectangle if and only if \(-5 \leq x \leq 5\) and \(-4 \leq y \leq 4\).

Let's check each point:

1. For the point \((5,4)\):
   - The x-coordinate is \(5\), which is within the range \([-5, 5]\).
   - The y-coordinate is \(4\), which is within the range \([-4, 4]\).
   - Therefore, the point \((5,4)\) lies within the rectangle.

2. For the point \((-5,4)\):
   - The x-coordinate is \(-5\), which is within the range \([-5, 5]\).
   - The y-coordinate is \(4\), which is within the range \([-4, 4]\).
   - Therefore, the point \((-5,4)\) lies within the rectangle.

3. For the point \((-5,-4)\):
   - The x-coordinate is \(-5\), which is within the range \([-5, 5]\).
   - The y-coordinate is \(-4\), which is within the range \([-4, 4]\).
   - Therefore, the point \((-5,-4)\) lies within the rectangle.

4. For the point \((5,-4)\):
   - The x-coordinate is \(5\), which is within the range \([-5, 5]\).
   - The y-coordinate is \(-4\), which is within the range \([-4, 4]\).
   - Therefore, the point \((5,-4)\) lies within the rectangle.

Since all the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\) lie within the rectangle, there is no point that does not lie within the rectangle. However, if we assume there was a typo and the problem meant to ask for a point outside the rectangle, we would need to re-evaluate the problem statement.

Given the problem statement and the points provided, the correct answer is:

\(\boxed{\text{No point does not lie within the rectangle}}\)

If there was a different set of points or a different problem statement, we would need to re-evaluate the problem. Based on the given problem statement and points, the answer is:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To determine the prisha of the stampial that Beth ooded, we need to find the total cost of the stampial she bought from the gasgliad. The gasgliad sells stampial in four different denominations: Brazil, Ffrainc, Periw, and Sbaen. The cost of each stampial is as follows:

- Brazil: $6$ cent per stampial
- Ffrainc: $4$ cent per stampial
- Periw: $4$ cent per stampial
- Sbaen: $5$ cent per stampial

Beth bought the following number of stampial from each country:

- Brazil: $12$
- Ffrainc: $15$
- Periw: $6$
- Sbaen: $13$

To find the total cost, we multiply the number of stampial bought from each country by the cost per stampial and then sum these amounts.

First, we calculate the cost of the stampial from Brazil:
\[ 12 \text{ stampial} \times 6 \text{ cent per stampial} = 72 \text{ cent} \]

Next, we calculate the cost of the stampial from Ffrainc:
\[ 15 \text{ stampial} \times 4 \text{ cent per stampial} = 60 \text{ cent} \]

Then, we calculate the cost of the stampial from Periw:
\[ 6 \text{ stampial} \times 4 \text{ cent per stampial} = 24 \text{ cent} \]

Finally, we calculate the cost of the stampial from Sbaen:
\[ 13 \text{ stampial} \times 5 \text{ cent per stampial} = 65 \text{ cent} \]

Now, we sum the costs from all four countries:
\[ 72 \text{ cent} + 60 \text{ cent} + 24 \text{ cent} + 65 \text{ cent} = 221 \text{ cent} \]

Therefore, the prisha of the stampial that Beth ooded is \(\boxed{221}\).","[221, '221']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\) and \(AC \perp CD\), we know that \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). This implies that \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD\) as the right angle. Let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows: \(AD = a\), \(BC = b\), \(CD = c\), and \(AC = d\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by the formula:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
Since \(AC\) is perpendicular to \(CD\), the height of the trapezoid is the length of \(CD\), which is \(c\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of a right triangle is given by:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Here, the base is \(AD = a\) and the height is \(CD = c\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We can express \(a \times c\) in terms of \(a + b\) and \(c\) using the equation \((a + b) \times c = 84\). Solving for \(a \times c\), we get:
\[
a \times c = 84 - b \times c
\]

However, we can also use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can be expressed in terms of the area of the trapezoid and the area of \(\triangle ABC\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) can be written as:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC]
\]
Substituting the known values, we get:
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

Since \(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = [\triangle ABC]\), we can substitute \(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times c\) with \(\frac{1}{2} \times (84 - a \times c)\) from the equation \(a \times c = 84 - b \times c\):
\[
42 = [\triangle ACD] + \frac{1}{2} \times (84 - a \times c)
\]

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid when the height is the same and the base is half the sum of the parallel sides. Therefore, we can directly find:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{a+b} \times [ABCD]
\]

Given that \(a + b = \frac{84}{c}\), we can substitute:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{a+b} \times 42 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{\frac{84}{c}} \times 42 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a \times c}{84} \times 42 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a \times c}{2} = \frac{a \times c}{4}
\]

Since \(a \times c = 84 - b \times c\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid when the height is the same and the base is half the sum of the parallel sides. Therefore, we can directly find:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{a+b} \times [ABCD]
\]

Given that \(a + b = \frac{84}{c}\), we can substitute:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{a+b} \times 42 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a}{\frac{84}{c}} \times 42 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a \times c}{84} \times 42 = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{a \times c}{2} = \frac{a \times c}{4}

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots.
2. **Solve the resulting equation** for \(x\).
3. **Check the solution** to ensure it satisfies the original equation and the domain constraints.

Let's start with the given equation:
\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

First, square both sides to eliminate the square roots:
\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, cross-multiply to clear the fraction:
\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

Now, isolate \(x\) by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:
\[
-19x = -9
\]

Divide both sides by \(-19\):
\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check if \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) satisfies the original equation and the domain constraints. The domain constraints are:
1. \(2x \geq 0\) (since we have \(\sqrt{2x}\))
2. \(3x - 1 > 0\) (since we have \(\sqrt{3x-1}\))

For \(x = \frac{9}{19}\):
1. \(2x = 2 \cdot \frac{9}{19} = \frac{18}{19} \geq 0\)
2. \(3x - 1 = 3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1 = \frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19} = \frac{8}{19} > 0\)

Both conditions are satisfied, so \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) is a valid solution.

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( \frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right) \) to the fractions \( \frac{7}{30} \) and \( \frac{10}{21} \).

First, identify the values of \( m \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( q \) from the fractions:
- For \( \frac{7}{30} \), \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 30 \).
- For \( \frac{10}{21} \), \( p = 10 \) and \( q = 21 \).

Next, substitute these values into the operation formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Now, perform the multiplication step by step:
1. Multiply \( 7 \) and \( 10 \):
\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

2. Simplify the fraction \( \frac{21}{30} \):
\[
\frac{21}{30} = \frac{21 \div 3}{30 \div 3} = \frac{7}{10}
\]

3. Multiply \( 70 \) by \( \frac{7}{10} \):
\[
70 \times \frac{7}{10} = 70 \times 0.7 = 49

Thus, the value of \( \frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} \) is \(\boxed{49}\).","[49, '49']",49,"[49, '49']",True
"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when the points are chosen randomly on a circle. For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (to account for the rotational symmetry) and by 2 (to account for the reflectional symmetry). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we should consider the linear arrangements and then divide by 2 for the reflectional symmetry. The correct approach is to consider the linear arrangements and then divide by 2 for the reflectional symmetry. The correct total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12
   \]

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following two ways: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\) (and their reflections). There are 2 such arrangements for each pair of points, so there are \(2 \times 2 = 4\) favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve for the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the area of the entire cylinder and the area of the sector of the cylinder that corresponds to the given fraction.

First, we calculate the area of the entire cylinder. The cylinder has two circular bases and a rectangular side. The area of one base is given by the formula for the area of a circle, \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius. Since the radius is 1, the area of one base is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
Since there are two bases, the total area of the bases is:
\[
2\pi
\]
The area of the rectangular side is the circumference of the base times the height of the cylinder. The circumference of the base is \(2\pi \times 1 = 2\pi\), and the height is 2, so the area of the rectangular side is:
\[
2\pi \times 2 = 4\pi
\]
Therefore, the total surface area of the cylinder is:
\[
2\pi + 4\pi = 6\pi
\]

Next, we know that the area of the sector of the cylinder is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the total surface area. So, we calculate the area of the sector:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 6\pi = \frac{30\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{2}
\]

The sector of the cylinder consists of a part of the lateral surface area and a part of the areas of the two bases. Since the sector is a fraction of the cylinder, the angle \(\angle ADC\) is a fraction of the full circle, which is \(360^\circ\). Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The fraction of the circle that the sector represents is \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ}\).

The area of the sector of the cylinder can also be expressed as the sum of the area of the part of the lateral surface and the area of the part of the bases. The area of the part of the lateral surface is \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi\), and the area of the part of the bases is \(\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi\). Therefore, the total area of the sector is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi + \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 2\pi = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 6\pi
\]
We know this area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{2}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 6\pi = \frac{5\pi}{2}
\]
We can cancel \(\pi\) from both sides of the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 6 = \frac{5}{2}
\]
Next, we solve for \(\theta\) by multiplying both sides by 360:
\[
\theta \times 6 = \frac{5}{2} \times 360
\]
\[
\theta \times 6 = 900
\]
\[
\theta = \frac{900}{6} = 150
\]
Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how much water will overflow when the conical beaker is filled and then placed into the cylindrical tank, we need to calculate the volume of water in the conical beaker and then compare it to the volume of the cylindrical tank.

First, let's calculate the volume of the conical beaker. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone is:
\[
V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone. For the conical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (8) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (9) (8) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (72) = 24 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. For the cylindrical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (6)^2 (8) = \pi (36) (8) = 288 \pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Since the volume of the conical beaker is \( 24 \pi \) cubic cm and the volume of the cylindrical tank is \( 288 \pi \) cubic cm, the conical beaker will not overflow when it is filled and placed into the cylindrical tank. The amount of water that will overflow is:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100:
\[
\frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{100}
\]
\[
\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}
\]

"To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many books Mae has after reading 20 books.
2. Determine how many books Beth has after reading 20 books.
3. Calculate the difference in the number of books between Beth and Mae.

Let's start with Mae:
- Mae starts with 50 books.
- She reads 20 books.
- Therefore, the number of books Mae has left is \(50 - 20 = 30\).

Next, let's consider Beth:
- Beth starts with 30 books.
- She reads 20 books.
- Therefore, the number of books Beth has left is \(30 - 20 = 10\).

Now, we need to find out how many more books Beth has than Mae:
- Beth has 10 books left.
- Mae has 30 books left.
- The difference is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

However, the problem asks how many more books Beth has than Mae after Beth has read 20 books and Mae has read 20 books. Since Beth has read fewer books than Mae, she will have more books left. The difference in the number of books between Beth and Mae is \(30 - 10 = 20\).

Therefore, Beth has \(\boxed{20}\) more books than Mae after they have both read 20 books.","[20, '20']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"To determine the total number of ways Mae can choose her representatives, we need to consider the choices for each state separately and then multiply the results together.

1. **Choosing representatives from Senedd:**
   - Mae can choose 8 representatives from 60.
   - The number of ways to choose 8 representatives from 60 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.
   - Here, \( n = 60 \) and \( k = 8 \), so the number of ways is \( \binom{60}{8} \).

2. **Choosing representatives from Democratia:**
   - Mae can choose 6 representatives from 40.
   - The number of ways to choose 6 representatives from 40 is \( \binom{40}{6} \).

3. **Choosing representatives from the new state:**
   - Mae can choose 5 representatives from 50.
   - The number of ways to choose 5 representatives from 50 is \( \binom{50}{5} \).

4. **Choosing representatives from the new state:**
   - Mae can choose 1 representative from 10.
   - The number of ways to choose 1 representative from 10 is \( \binom{10}{1} = 10 \).

To find the total number of ways Mae can choose all the representatives, we multiply the number of ways to choose representatives from each state:
\[
\binom{60}{8} \times \binom{40}{6} \times \binom{50}{5} \times 10

Therefore, the total number of ways Mae can choose her representatives is \(\boxed{\binom{60}{8} \times \binom{40}{6} \times \binom{50}{5} \times 10}\).","[2558620845*3838380*2118760*10, '\\binom{60}{8} \\times \\binom{40}{6} \\times \\binom{50}{5} \\times 10']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",False

First, we calculate \(a - b\):
\[a - b = 513 - 487 = 26\]

Next, we calculate \(a + b\):
\[a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000\]

Now, we substitute these values into the difference of squares formula:
\[513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000 = 26000\]

From the first condition, we have:
\[
a + b + c = 120
\]

From the second condition, the average of the three rhif cyfan is given by:
\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x - 2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62
\]

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we discard \(x = -62\) and keep \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the positive value of \(x\) is:

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{P(1)}{2^{15} (-1)} = \frac{2^{15} - 1}{-2^{15}} = -\frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. Notice that:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) \right) \left( \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) \right).
\]

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right)\), \(\cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}\), \(\cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right)\), and \(\cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\), we have:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{5} \right) \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{5} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right).
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\left( \cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) \right)^2 = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and \(AM = 11\), where \(D\) is a point on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(AM\) is the altitude and the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Since \(BD = CD\) (because \(D\) is on the altitude \(AM\)), we have:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - \cos(3\theta)).
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2BD^2 (1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)) = 2BD^2 (4\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^3(\theta)) = 8BD^2 \cos(\theta)(1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 8BD^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]

Next, we need to find \(BD\). Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) and \(AD = 10\), \(DM = 1\). In right triangle \(BDM\), we have:
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2.
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\), we can substitute \(BM\) with \(\frac{BC}{2}\):
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1.
\]
Substituting \(BD^2\) into the equation for \(BC^2\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 8 \left(\frac{BC^2}{4} + 1\right) \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 2BC^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) + 8 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]
Rearranging terms, we have:
\[
BC^2 - 2BC^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 8 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta),
\]
\[
BC^2 (1 - 2\cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)) = 8 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta).
\]
Solving for \(BC^2\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = \frac{8 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)}{1 - 2\cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)}.
\]

Now, we need to find \(\cos(\theta)\) and \(\sin(\theta)\). Since \(AM = 11\) and \(AD = 10\), \(DM = 1\). In right triangle \(AMD\), we have:
\[
AM^2 = AD^2 + DM^2,
\]
\[
11^2 = 10^2 + BM^2,
\]
\[
121 = 100 + BM^2,
\]
\[
BM^2 = 21,
\]
\[
BM = \sqrt{21}.
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\), we have:
\[
BC = 2\sqrt{21}.
\]

In right triangle \(AMD\), we also have:
\[
\cos(\theta) = \frac{DM}{AM} = \frac{1}{11}.
\]
Using the Pythagorean identity, \(\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta)\), we get:
\[
\sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{11}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{1}{121} = \frac{120}{121}.
\]

Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{1}{11}\) and \(\sin^2(\theta) = \frac{120}{121}\) into the equation for \(BC^2\), we get:
\[
BC^2 = \frac{8 \cdot \frac{1}{11} \cdot \frac{120}{121}}{1 - 2 \cdot \frac{1}{11} \cdot \frac{120}{121}} = \frac{\frac{960}{1331}}{1 - \frac{240}{1331}} = \frac{\frac{960}{1331}}{\frac{1091}{1331}} = \frac{960}{1091}.
\]
Since \(BC = 2\sqrt{21}\), we have:
\[
BC^2 = (2\sqrt{21})^2 = 84.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
84 = \frac{960}{1091}.
\]
This is a contradiction, so we need to recheck the calculations.

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

This is a quadratic inequality. First, we solve the corresponding quadratic equation:

\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0 \]

We can factor this quadratic equation:

\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the roots:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have:

\[ y < 3 \]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[ x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Combining the Results

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true. Therefore, the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is determined by the solution to \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), which is:

\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine the number of 11th graders who would have a theithwyr bwin at $135\%$ of the number of 11th graders who have a theithwyr bwin, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of 11th graders who have a theithwyr bwin.
2. Calculate 135% of that number.

First, let's find the number of 11th graders who have a theithwyr bwin. According to the table, 13.8% of the 11th graders have a theithwyr bwin. Since the total number of 11th graders is 300, we can calculate the number of 11th graders with a theithwyr bwin as follows:

Since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 41.4 to the nearest whole number, which is 41. Therefore, 41 11th graders have a theithwyr bwin.

Next, we need to find 135% of 41. To do this, we multiply 41 by 1.35:
\[

Again, since the number of students must be a whole number, we round 55.35 to the nearest whole number, which is 55.

So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) will be equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the intervals where the expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative. We will consider the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\) and test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative and \((x + 9)\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative and \((x + 9)\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[\boxed{(-9, 0) \cup (9, 36)}.\]","[Union(Interval.open(-9, 0), Interval.open(9, 36)), '(-9, 0) \\cup (9, 36)']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"To determine the maximum possible area of Mae's cae, we need to analyze the given trac and the shape of the cae. The trac is a rectangle with a semicircle at each end, and the total length of the trac is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the radius of the semicircles by \( r \). The total length of the trac consists of the length of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi r \), so the total length of the trac is:
\[ L + 2\pi r = 400 \]

We need to express the area of the cae in terms of \( r \). The area of the cae consists of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles. The area of the rectangle is \( L \times 2r \), and the area of one semicircle is \( \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 \), so the total area of the cae is:
\[ \text{Area} = L \times 2r + 2 \times \frac{1}{2} \pi r^2 = 2rL + \pi r^2 \]

From the equation \( L + 2\pi r = 400 \), we can solve for \( L \):
\[ L = 400 - 2\pi r \]

Substituting this expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[ \text{Area} = 2r(400 - 2\pi r) + \pi r^2 = 800r - 4\pi r^2 + \pi r^2 = 800r - 3\pi r^2 \]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of the area with respect to \( r \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dr}(800r - 3\pi r^2) = 800 - 6\pi r \]
\[ 800 - 6\pi r = 0 \]
\[ 6\pi r = 800 \]
\[ r = \frac{800}{6\pi} = \frac{400}{3\pi} \]

Now, we substitute \( r = \frac{400}{3\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[ L = 400 - 2\pi \left( \frac{400}{3\pi} \right) = 400 - \frac{800}{3} = \frac{1200}{3} - \frac{800}{3} = \frac{400}{3} \]

Finally, we substitute \( L = \frac{400}{3} \) and \( r = \frac{400}{3\pi} \) into the area formula:
\[ \text{Area} = 2 \left( \frac{400}{3} \right) \left( \frac{400}{3\pi} \right) + \pi \left( \frac{400}{3\pi} \right)^2 = \frac{800 \cdot 400}{9\pi} + \pi \left( \frac{160000}{9\pi^2} \right) = \frac{320000}{9\pi} + \frac{160000}{9\pi} = \frac{480000}{9\pi} = \frac{160000}{3\pi} \]

Therefore, the maximum possible area of Mae's cae is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{160000}{3\pi}} \]","[160000/((3*pi)), '\\frac{160000}{3\\pi}']",\frac{20000}{\pi},[],False
"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In \(\triangle RST\), the Pythagorean theorem gives:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}}\).","[sqrt(21)/5, '\\frac{\\sqrt{21}}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],True
"To find the minimum value of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by analyzing the expression inside the function. The term \( x^2 - 3 \) is a quadratic function in \( x \), and it achieves its minimum value when \( x^2 \) is minimized. Since \( x^2 \) is always non-negative and its minimum value is 0, the minimum value of \( x^2 - 3 \) is \( -3 \). Therefore, the minimum value of \( y \) is:

\[
y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(-3) = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \( \sqrt{2} \):

\[
y = -\frac{3}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}} = -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( y \) is \( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} \). In this expression, \( a = 18 \) and \( b = 2 \) because \( -\frac{3\sqrt{2}}{2} = -\frac{\sqrt{18}}{2} \). Therefore, the sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 18 + 2 = 20
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -2 \):

Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \neq 0 \]
Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0 \]
Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \neq 0 \]
Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \neq 0 \]
Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \neq 0 \]
Let's test \( x = 4 \):
\[ -(4)^3 + 2(4)^2 + 3(4) - 6 = -64 + 32 + 12 - 6 = -26 \neq 0 \]
Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \neq 0 \]

"To determine the length of the line segment from point \( P \) to the center of the octahedron, we first need to find the coordinates of the center of the octahedron. The octahedron has vertices at \( A = (1,0,0) \), \( B = (-1,0,0) \), \( C = (0,1,0) \), \( D = (0,-1,0) \), \( E = (0,0,1) \), and \( F = (0,0,-1) \). The center of the octahedron is the average of the coordinates of these vertices.

The coordinates of the center are:
\[
\left( \frac{1 + (-1) + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0}{6}, \frac{0 + 0 + 1 + (-1) + 0 + 0}{6}, \frac{0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + (-1)}{6} \right) = \left( \frac{0}{6}, \frac{0}{6}, \frac{0}{6} \right) = (0,0,0)
\]

Next, we need to find the distance from point \( P = (1.2, 1.5, 1) \) to the center \( (0,0,0) \). The distance formula in three dimensions is:
\[
\sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \( P \) and the center, we get:
\[
\sqrt{(1.2 - 0)^2 + (1.5 - 0)^2 + (1 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{1.2^2 + 1.5^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{1.44 + 2.25 + 1} = \sqrt{4.69} = \sqrt{\frac{469}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{469}}{10}

Therefore, the length of the line segment from point \( P \) to the center of the octahedron is:

"To determine the ratio of the amount of fish Jen caught to the amount of fish Jack caught, we start by identifying the amounts given in the problem. Jen caught 200 grams of fish, and Jack caught 150 grams of fish. The ratio of the amount of fish Jen caught to the amount of fish Jack caught is calculated by dividing the amount Jen caught by the amount Jack caught. This can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Amount Jen caught}}{\text{Amount Jack caught}} = \frac{200}{150}
\]

Next, we simplify the fraction \(\frac{200}{150}\). We do this by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200 and 150. The GCD of 200 and 150 is 50. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[
\frac{200 \div 50}{150 \div 50} = \frac{4}{3}

"To solve the problem, we need to convert the given numbers from their respective bases to base 10, perform the subtraction, and then convert the result back to the specified base.

First, let's convert \(629_{10}\) to base 10. Since it is already in base 10, it remains \(629_{10}\).

Next, we need to convert \(77_{8}\) to base 10. The number \(77_{8}\) can be expanded as:
\[77_{8} = 7 \cdot 8^1 + 7 \cdot 8^0 = 7 \cdot 8 + 7 \cdot 1 = 56 + 7 = 63_{10}\]

Now, we subtract \(63_{10}\) from \(629_{10}\):
\[629_{10} - 63_{10} = 566_{10}\]

Next, we need to convert \(566_{10}\) to base 7. To do this, we repeatedly divide by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[566 \div 7 = 80 \text{ remainder } 6\]
\[80 \div 7 = 11 \text{ remainder } 3\]
\[11 \div 7 = 1 \text{ remainder } 4\]
\[1 \div 7 = 0 \text{ remainder } 1\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(566_{10} = 1436_7\).

Therefore, the result of subtracting \(77_8\) from \(629_{10}\) in base 7 is \(\boxed{1436_7}\).","[1436, '1436_7']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine how many ysgwyd llaw a ddigwyddodd in the cyfarfod, let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of gurachodd:**
   - Mae chwe gurach odd a deg dewin yn cymysgu mwen cyfarfod arcanaidd.
   - Therefore, the total number of gurach odd is \(2 \times 10 = 20\).

2. **Determine how many gurach odd were pended:**
   - Mae r gurach odd wedi penderfynu ysgwyd llaw gyda phob un o r dewinaid.
   - Since there are 10 dewinaids, and each dewinaid has 2 gurach odd, the total number of gurach odd pended is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

3. **Determine how many gurach odd were traffic:**
   - Mae r un o r gurach odd eri traffic ysgwyd llaw â i gilydd.
   - Therefore, the number of gurach odd traffic is 1.

4. **Determine how many gurach odd were ffrindiau:**
   - Mae r dewinaid i gyd yn rhyw fath o gasáu ei gilydd.
   - Since there are 10 dewinaids, and each dewinaid has 2 gurach odd, the total number of gurach odd ffrindiau is \(10 \times 2 = 20\).

5. **Determine how many gurach odd were erill:**
   - Mae r dewinaid i gyd yn erill ysgwyd llaw.
   - Therefore, the number of gurach odd erill is 1.

6. **Calculate the number of ysgwyd llaw a ddigwyddodd:**
   - The total number of gurach odd is 20.
   - The number of gurach odd pended is 20.
   - The number of gurach odd traffic is 1.
   - The number of gurach odd ffrindiau is 20.
   - The number of gurach odd erill is 1.
   - The number of ysgwyd llaw a ddigwyddodd is the total number of gurach odd minus the number of gurach odd pended minus the number of gurach odd traffic minus the number of gurach odd ffrindiau minus the number of gurach odd erill.
   - Therefore, the number of ysgwyd llaw a ddigwyddodd is \(20 - 20 - 1 - 20 - 1 = -22\).

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we calculate \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line in standard form.

First, we need to convert the equation \(y = 2x - 2\) into standard form. We do this by subtracting \(y\) from both sides:

\[
0 = 2x - y - 2
\]

So, in standard form, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\).

Next, we substitute the coordinates of the point \((6, 0)\) into the formula. Here, \(x_1 = 6\) and \(y_1 = 0\).

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Now, simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the distance \(d\) is:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To rationalize the denominator, we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5}

Simplify the fraction:

\[

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots. For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:

1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)
2. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
3. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\)
4. \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\)

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) respectively. Then we have:

\[a + b + c = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0\]

We also know from Vieta's formulas that:

\[\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[\alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0\]

Using \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\), we can express \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4\) as \(-2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[\alpha_1\alpha_2(-2 - (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)) + \alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 0\]

This simplifies to:

\[-2\alpha_1\alpha_2 - \alpha_1^2\alpha_2 - \alpha_1\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_1 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\alpha_2 = 0\]

Rearranging terms, we get:

\[\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) - \alpha_1\alpha_2(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\]

Factoring out \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2\) on the left side, we get:

\[(\alpha_3\alpha_4 - \alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we can express \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\) as \(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[\left(\frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2} - \alpha_1\alpha_2\right)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\]

Dividing both sides by \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\), we get:

\[\left(\frac{2}{\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2} - 1\right)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2) = 2\]

This equation is symmetric in \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\), and similarly in \(\alpha_3\) and \(\alpha_4\). Therefore, the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) must be the same, except possibly in some order. Since \(a + b + c = 0\), the only possible values are \(a = b = c = 0\).

Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

   - The cost of pensil ac un rhwbiwr jumbo is $2.46.

2. **Understand the structure of the problem:**

   - Mae bought pensil ac un rhwbiwr jumbo, which means she bought one pen and one eraser.
   - Mae bought pensil ac un rhwbiwr jumbo, which means she bought one pen and one eraser.

3. **Set up the equations:**
   - Let \( p \) be the cost of pensil.
   - Let \( e \) be the cost of eraser.
   - From the first purchase: \( p + e = 1.24 \)
   - From the second purchase: \( p + e = 1.82 \)
   - From the third purchase: \( p + e = 2.46 \)

4. **Notice the contradiction:**
   - The problem states that Mae bought the same items each time, but the total cost is different. This suggests there might be a mistake in the problem statement or an additional context we are missing. However, if we assume the problem meant to say she bought different combinations of items each time, we can solve it by finding the average cost of pensil and eraser.

5. **Assume the problem meant different combinations:**
   - Let's assume she bought pensil and eraser in different combinations each time. We need to find the cost of pensil.

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) by adding zeros to 137 and continuing the division.

Let's do the division step by step:

- \(500\) goes into \(1370\) (which is \(137\) with an added zero) \(2\) times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). So, we write \(2\) after the decimal point.
- Subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
- Bring down another zero to make it \(3700\). Now, \(500\) goes into \(3700\) \(7\) times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). So, we write \(7\) next to the \(2\).
- Subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
- Bring down another zero to make it \(2000\). Now, \(500\) goes into \(2000\) \(4\) times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). So, we write \(4\) next to the \(7\).
- Subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

Given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb
\]

The equation of the perpendicular bisector of the line segment joining \(O\) and \(A\) is:
\[
y = \frac{b}{a}x = \frac{b}{kb}x = \frac{1}{k}x
\]

Similarly, the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments joining \(O\) and \(B\), \(O\) and \(C\), and \(O\) and \(D\) are:
\[
y = -\frac{1}{k}x, \quad y = \frac{1}{k}x, \quad y = -\frac{1}{k}x
\]

These bisectors form a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with vertices at:
\[
\left(\pm \frac{a}{2}, \pm \frac{b}{2}\right)
\]

The side lengths of this smaller rectangle are:
\[
\text{Length} = a = kb, \quad \text{Width} = b
\]

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = kb \times b = kb^2
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab = 4(kb) \times b = 4kb^2
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the original rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{kb^2}{4kb^2} = \frac{1}{4}

Thus, the probability is:

"To solve the problem \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Here are the steps to find the remainder:

1. Perform the division of 54 by 6.
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   This tells us that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9.

2. Multiply the quotient by the divisor to find the product.
   \[
   9 \times 6 = 54
   \]
   This tells us that 9 times 6 is 54.

3. Subtract the product from the original number to find the remainder.
   \[
   54 - 54 = 0

   This tells us that the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is 0.

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine the total amount of money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie spent on books, we need to add their individual expenses together. Let's break it down step by step.

First, we write down the amounts each person spent:
- Linda: \$27.47
- Sherry: \$35.23
- June: \$37.37
- Connie: \$26.52

Next, we add these amounts together. We can do this by adding them in pairs to make the calculation easier:

1. Add Linda's and Sherry's expenses:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]

2. Add June's and Connie's expenses:
   \[

Therefore, the total amount of money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie spent on books is \(\boxed{126.59}\).","[126.590000000000, '126.59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average number of fyfyrwyr sgôr that Cymer odd dosbarth, we need to follow these steps:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given grid, we need to use the information that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:

2. Calculate the total number of roedeffeddi Mae Martha has.
3. Find the difference between the total number of roedeffeddi Mae Jim has and the total number of roedeffeddi Mae Martha has.

First, let's calculate the total number of roedeffeddi Mae Jim has. Mae Jim has 300 roedeffeddi o led and 400 roedeffeddi o hyd. Therefore, the total number of roedeffeddi Mae Jim has is:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex cube root of unity, we know that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\). The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), and they satisfy the identity \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) and \(\omega = -1 - \omega^2\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). To do this, we first find a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Using the identity \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we substitute \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\) into the numerator:

\[
\frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 - 1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Next, we expand the denominator:

\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3
\]

Again, using the identity \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we substitute these values into the expression:

\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{1}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{1}{1} = 1
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the area of the quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we can break it down into two triangles: \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\). We will find the area of each triangle separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of \(\triangle ABD\)

The vertices of \(\triangle ABD\) are:
- \(A = (-3, 3)\)
- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(D = (0, 0)\)

We can use the formula for the area of a triangle given its vertices \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\):
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2 - y_3) + x_2(y_3 - y_1) + x_3(y_1 - y_2) \right|
\]

Substituting the coordinates of \(A\), \(B\), and \(D\):
\[
\text{Area}_{ABD} = \frac{1}{2} \left| (-3)(0 - 0) + 3(0 - 3) + 0(3 - 0) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 0 - 9 + 0 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| -9 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 9
\]
\[
= 4.5
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the area of \(\triangle BCD\)

The vertices of \(\triangle BCD\) are:
- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -4)\)
- \(D = (0, 0)\)

Using the same area formula:
\[
\text{Area}_{BCD} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 3(-4 - 0) + 0(0 - 0) + 0(0 - (-4)) \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| 3(-4) + 0 + 0 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \left| -12 \right|
\]
\[
= \frac{1}{2} \times 12
\]
\[
= 6
\]

### Step 3: Sum the areas of \(\triangle ABD\) and \(\triangle BCD\)

The total area of quadrilateral \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area}_{ABCD} = \text{Area}_{ABD} + \text{Area}_{BCD}

\[
