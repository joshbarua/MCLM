"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying this equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the value of \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the value of \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can stand in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas must all be next to each other, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) in a circle.

2. **Arrange the 6 units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who stands first, 2 choices for who stands next, and 1 choice for who stands last. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: To find the total number of ways to arrange the 8 people in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all next to each other, we multiply the number of ways to arrange the 6 units by the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can stand in a circle such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas are all next to each other is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}

\[

So, the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) becomes:

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[

Now, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

So, \( 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Therefore, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is:

"To determine the minimum number of moves required to return a regular pentagon to its original position after being rotated around its center, we need to consider the properties of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of order 5, which means it can be rotated by \( \frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ \) and still look the same. Therefore, the pentagon will return to its original position after a rotation of \( 72^\circ \times 5 = 360^\circ \).

If we start with the pentagon in its original position and rotate it by \( 72^\circ \), it will be in a new position. If we rotate it again by \( 72^\circ \), it will be in another new position, and so on. After 5 such rotations, the pentagon will have been rotated by \( 360^\circ \) and will be back in its original position.

Thus, the minimum number of moves required to return the pentagon to its original position is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of a parallelogram given three vertices, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). This means our initial assumption about the order of the vertices might be incorrect. Let's consider another pair of diagonals.

Let's assume \( A(5, 3) \) and \( D(x, y) \) are opposite vertices, and \( B(6, 8) \) and \( C(7, 4) \) are opposite vertices. The midpoint of \( BD \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

The midpoint of \( AC \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \implies 5+x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6 \implies 3+y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Since \( x = 8 \) satisfies \( x > 7 \), the coordinates of \( D \) are \( (8, 9) \).

Finally, we find \( x + y \):
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"To determine the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) for the function \(f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14}\), we need to analyze the vertical and horizontal asymptotes.

First, let's find the vertical asymptotes. Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. The denominator of the function is \(x^2 - 5x - 14\). We need to factorize this quadratic expression:

\[
x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
\]

So, the function can be rewritten as:

\[
f(x) = \frac{2x}{(x - 7)(x + 2)}
\]

The vertical asymptotes occur at the values of \(x\) that make the denominator zero, which are \(x = 7\) and \(x = -2\). Therefore, \(a = 7\) and \(b = -2\).

Next, let's find the horizontal asymptote. Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \(y = 0\). Therefore, \(c = 0\).

Now, we need to find the sum \(a + b + c\):

\[
a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5

Thus, the value of \(a + b + c\) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True

holds for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[

\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.

Thus, the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) is \(\sqrt{17}\), and the operator norm of \( A \) is \(\sqrt{17}\).

     - \(9^2 = 81\) (which is greater than 36, so we use \(9^1\) and \(9^0\))
     - \(9^1 = 9\)

\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

\[
\boxed{\cot x}
\]","[cot(x), '\\cot x']",\cot x,[],True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one treek in terms of the weight of one squig. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. One treek, three squigs, and one goolee weigh the same as three squigs and one goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   t + 3s + g = 3s + g
   \]
   Subtracting \( 3s + g \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   t = 0
   \]
   This equation is not useful in its current form, so let's re-evaluate the problem statement and correct it to:
   \[
   t + 3s + g = 3s + g
   \]
   correct form is:
   \]
   t + 3s + g = 3s + g

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial.

1. Multiply \(3t^2\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

2. Multiply \(5t\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

3. Multiply \(a\) by each term in \(4t^2 + bt - 2\):
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these products:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the change in the volume of water as it rolls down the slope. The volume of water decreases by the volume of water that flows out through the hole at the bottom of the tank.

First, let's calculate the volume of water that flows out in one hour. The rate of flow is given as \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour. Therefore, in one hour, the volume of water that flows out is:
\[
20\pi \text{ cubic meters}
\]

Next, we need to determine the volume of water that corresponds to a decrease in height of 4 meters. The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius of the base and \(h\) is the height. In this case, the height \(h\) is 4 meters. So, the volume of water that corresponds to a decrease in height of 4 meters is:
\[
V = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 = 4\pi r^2 \text{ cubic meters}
\]

Since the volume of water that flows out in one hour is equal to the volume of water that corresponds to a decrease in height of 4 meters, we can set up the following equation:
\[
4\pi r^2 = 20\pi
\]

To solve for \(r^2\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(4\pi\):
\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
r = \sqrt{5}
\]

Therefore, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{5}}

"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at most once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
- If \(a > 0\), the quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards.
- If \(a < 0\), the quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening downwards.
- If \(a = 0\), the quadratic function \(f(x) = 0\) is a horizontal line.

### Step 2: Analyze the linear piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
- If \(a > 0\), the linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a line with a positive slope.
- If \(a < 0\), the linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a line with a negative slope.
- If \(a = 0\), the linear function \(f(x) = 0\) is a horizontal line.

### Step 3: Determine the intersection points with horizontal lines
For \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at most once, the function must be strictly monotonic (either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing) over its entire domain.

#### Case 1: \(a > 0\)
- The quadratic piece \(ax^2\) is increasing for \(x \geq a\).
- The linear piece \(ax + 2a\) is increasing for \(x < a\).

To ensure \(f(x)\) is strictly increasing, we need to check the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

For \(x < a\), the value of \(f(x)\) is:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]

We need \(f(a) \leq f(x)\) for all \(x < a\):
\[ a^3 \leq ax + 2a. \]

Rearrange the inequality:
\[ a^3 - ax \leq 2a. \]

Factor out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - x) \leq 2a. \]

Since \(a > 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\):
\[ a^2 - x \leq 2. \]

Rearrange to solve for \(x\):
\[ x \geq a^2 - 2. \]

For \(f(x)\) to be strictly increasing, \(a^2 - 2\) must be less than or equal to \(a\):
\[ a^2 - a - 2 \leq 0. \]

Solve the quadratic inequality:
\[ (a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]

The roots of the equation \((a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\). The inequality \((a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for:
\[ -1 \leq a \leq 2. \]

Since \(a > 0\), we have:
\[ 0 < a \leq 2. \]

#### Case 2: \(a < 0\)
- The quadratic piece \(ax^2\) is decreasing for \(x \geq a\).
- The linear piece \(ax + 2a\) is decreasing for \(x < a\).

To ensure \(f(x)\) is strictly decreasing, we need to check the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

For \(x < a\), the value of \(f(x)\) is:
\[ f(x) = ax + 2a. \]

We need \(f(a) \geq f(x)\) for all \(x < a\):
\[ a^3 \geq ax + 2a. \]

Rearrange the inequality:
\[ a^3 - ax \geq 2a. \]

Factor out \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - x) \geq 2a. \]

Since \(a < 0\), we can divide both sides by \(a\) and reverse the inequality:
\[ a^2 - x \geq 2. \]

Rearrange to solve for \(x\):
\[ x \leq a^2 - 2. \]

For \(f(x)\) to be strictly decreasing, \(a^2 - 2\) must be greater than or equal to \(a\):
\[ a^2 - a - 2 \geq 0. \]

Solve the quadratic inequality:
\[ (a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0. \]

The roots of the equation \((a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 2\) and \(a = -1\). The inequality \((a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0\) holds for:
\[ a \leq -1 \quad \text{or} \quad a \geq 2. \]

Since \(a < 0\), we have:
\[ a \leq -1. \]

### Conclusion
Combining the results from both cases, the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at most once is:

"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To determine the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
The first part is equivalent to:
\[
\lambda - 1 \geq 0 \implies \lambda \geq 1.
\]
The second part is always true for \(\lambda > 0\). Therefore, the condition \(0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1\) is satisfied for \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2. We start by solving the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to be equal to \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = 0\) is a fixed point. We need to find the non-trivial solutions to the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be a solution, we substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left(-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1}\right) = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda \neq 1\), we need:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1} = 0.
\]
Simplifying the expression inside the parentheses, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda + 1 = -\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2 - \lambda + \lambda + 1 = 2\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 1.
\]
Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[
2\lambda^2 - 3\lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:
\[
(2\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us the solutions:
\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda = 1.
\]
Since we already know that \(\lambda = 1\) gives us a fixed point, the only value of \(\lambda\) that gives us a periodic point of period 2 is \(\lambda = \frac{1}{2}\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']","(3,4]",[],False
"To find the value of \(\theta\) such that \(\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
To simplify this, we can use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the angle subtraction formulas \(\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{1}{2} \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{3}{2} \sin 5^\circ}{-\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{-\cos 5^\circ - \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = -\frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 5^\circ + \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}.
\]
Therefore, \(\tan \theta = -\sqrt{3}\), and the angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this is:
\[
\theta = 120^\circ.
\]
The final answer is:
\[

"To determine the number of permutations of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider the fact that some of the letters are repeated. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter E appears 4 times, the letter L appears 2 times, and the letters I and P each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- \( n = 8 \) (total letters)
- \( n_1 = 4 \) (for E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for L)
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for I)
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for P)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{8!}{4! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320 \)
- \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[
\frac{40320}{24 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = \frac{40320}{48} = 840
\]

Therefore, the number of permutations of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( f(x, x) \) at these critical points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) that could give a value greater than 1. However, since the function \( f(x, y) \) is symmetric and the maximum value on the boundary and at the critical points inside the region is 1, we conclude that the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

The golden ratio satisfies the equation \( \phi^2 = \phi + 1 \). We will use this property to find a pattern in the powers of \( z \).

First, let's compute \( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \):

\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \left( z + \frac{1}{z} \right)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2 = (\phi + 1) - 2 = \phi - 1. \]

Next, let's compute \( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \):

\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = \left( z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \right)^2 - 2 = (\phi - 1)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2\phi + 1 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2\phi - 1 = (\phi + 1) - 2\phi - 1 = -\phi. \]

Next, let's compute \( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} \):

\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \left( z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} \right)^2 - 2 = (-\phi)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2 = (\phi + 1) - 2 = \phi - 1. \]

We observe that \( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). This suggests a periodicity in the sequence of \( z^{2^n} + \frac{1}{z^{2^n}} \) with a period of 6. To confirm, let's compute \( z^{16} + \frac{1}{z^{16}} \):

\[ z^{16} + \frac{1}{z^{16}} = \left( z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} \right)^2 - 2 = (\phi - 1)^2 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2\phi + 1 - 2 = \phi^2 - 2\phi - 1 = (\phi + 1) - 2\phi - 1 = -\phi. \]

Thus, we have:

\[ z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = \phi - 1, \]
\[ z^4 + \frac{1}{z^4} = -\phi, \]
\[ z^8 + \frac{1}{z^8} = \phi - 1, \]
\[ z^{16} + \frac{1}{z^{16}} = -\phi, \]
\[ z^{32} + \frac{1}{z^{32}} = \phi - 1, \]
\[ z^{64} + \frac{1}{z^{64}} = -\phi. \]

Since \( 85 \equiv 1 \pmod{6} \), we have:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = z^1 + \frac{1}{z^1} = \phi. \]

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \(G\) of a triangle and how it affects the areas of smaller triangles formed by lines parallel to the sides of the original triangle.

1. **Centroid Properties**: The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = BG:GE = CG:GF = 2:1\).

2. **Parallel Lines and Similar Triangles**: Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangle. Specifically, since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \(G\) to \(BC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

3. **Area Ratio**: The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the ratio of the area of triangle \(AMN\) to the area of triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10.

"To determine how many positive divisors the numbers 100 and 150 have in common, we first need to find their prime factorizations.

\[ 100 = 2^2 \times 5^2 \]

The prime factorization of 150 is:
\[ 150 = 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 \]

Next, we identify the common prime factors of 100 and 150. The common prime factors are 2 and 5. The lowest power of each common prime factor is 2^1 and 5^2.

Therefore, the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 100 and 150 is:

"To determine how many pentarides Η Χί尔αř has, we start by defining the variables for the number of each type of coin. Let's denote the number of dimes by \( d \) and the number of pentarides by \( p \). According to the problem, each dime is worth $10 and each pentaride is worth $5. The total value of all the coins combined is $75. This gives us the following equation:

\[ 10d + 5p = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

This equation tells us that the number of pentarides \( p \) can be expressed in terms of the number of dimes \( d \) as follows:

\[ p = 15 - 2d \]

Since \( d \) and \( p \) must be non-negative integers (you can't have a negative number of coins), we need to find the values of \( d \) that make \( p \) a non-negative integer. Let's test the possible values of \( d \):

- If \( d = 0 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(0) = 15 \).
- If \( d = 1 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(1) = 13 \).
- If \( d = 2 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(2) = 11 \).
- If \( d = 3 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(3) = 9 \).
- If \( d = 4 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(4) = 7 \).
- If \( d = 5 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(5) = 5 \).
- If \( d = 6 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(6) = 3 \).
- If \( d = 7 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(7) = 1 \).
- If \( d = 8 \), then \( p = 15 - 2(8) = -1 \) (which is not a valid solution since \( p \) must be non-negative).

Therefore, the possible values for \( p \) are 15, 13, 11, 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1. Since the problem does not specify the exact number of dimes, any of these values for \( p \) would satisfy the equation.

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen prime numbers from the first six prime numbers is even, we start by identifying the first six prime numbers. They are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of ways to choose 2 prime numbers out of 6. This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum of the two chosen prime numbers is even. This can happen in two ways:
1. Both numbers are even.
2. Both numbers are odd.

Since there is only one even number (2), the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers is:

\[

The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from the 5 odd numbers is:

\[

Therefore, the total number of favorable outcomes is:

"To determine the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) and the point \((a, b)\) lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\). This will give us an equation in terms of \( b \).
2. Solve the resulting equation for \( b \).

Let's start with the substitution:

\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Next, we perform the multiplication:

\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Now, we need to isolate \( b \). We do this by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Finally, we solve for \( b \) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]
\[ b = 0 \]

"To determine the total surface area of the shaded region, we need to analyze the given diagram and calculate the areas of the individual shaded triangles.

The diagram consists of two right triangles formed by the diagonals of a 3x4 rectangle. The vertices of the rectangle are at \((0,4)\), \((3,4)\), \((3,0)\), and \((0,0)\). The diagonals intersect at the point \((2,0)\).

Let's calculate the area of each triangle:

1. **First Triangle:**
   - Vertices: \((0,4)\), \((0,0)\), and \((2,0)\)
   - Base: The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0,0)\) to \((2,0)\), which is 2 units.
   - Height: The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((0,0)\) to \((0,4)\), which is 4 units.
   - Area: The area of a triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
     \[
     \text{Area of the first triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
     \]

2. **Second Triangle:**
   - Vertices: \((0,4)\), \((3,4)\), and \((2,0)\)
   - Base: The base of this triangle is the horizontal distance from \((2,0)\) to \((3,4)\), which is 1 unit (since the total width of the rectangle is 3 units and the base of the first triangle is 2 units).
   - Height: The height of this triangle is the vertical distance from \((2,0)\) to \((3,4)\), which is 4 units.
   - Area: The area of a triangle is given by \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\).
     \[
     \text{Area of the second triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2 \text{ square units}
     \]

To find the total surface area of the shaded region, we add the areas of the two triangles:

Thus, the total surface area of the shaded region is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",10,"[10, '10']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to find the smallest positive multiple of 450 such that all its digits are either 0 or 1. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Understand the constraints**: The number must be a multiple of 450, and it can only contain the digits 0 and 1. Since 450 = 2 × 3^2 × 5^2, the number must satisfy the divisibility rules for 2, 3, and 5.
   - Divisibility by 2: The number must end in 0.
   - Divisibility by 5: The number must end in 0.
   - Divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of the number must be divisible by 3.

2. **Form the number**: Since the number must end in 0 and can only contain the digits 0 and 1, we need to find a sequence of 1's and 0's such that the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. Let's start with the smallest possible numbers and check their sums.
   - 10: Sum = 1 (not divisible by 3)
   - 110: Sum = 2 (not divisible by 3)
   - 1110: Sum = 3 (divisible by 3)

   The number 1110 satisfies all the conditions. It is a multiple of 450, ends in 0, and the sum of its digits is 3, which is divisible by 3.

3. **Verify**: Let's verify that 1110 is indeed a multiple of 450.
   \[
   1110 \div 450 = 2.4667

   Since 1110 is not an integer multiple of 450, we need to find the next smallest number. Let's try a larger sequence.

   - 111110: Sum = 5 (not divisible by 3)
   - 1111110: Sum = 6 (divisible by 3)

   The number 1111110 satisfies all the conditions. It is a multiple of 450, ends in 0, and the sum of its digits is 6, which is divisible by 3.

4. **Verify**: Let's verify that 1111110 is indeed a multiple of 450.
   \[
   1111110 \div 450 = 2469

   Since 2469 is an integer, 1111110 is a multiple of 450.

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that a disk will land in a shaded square of a grid. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the grid and the shaded squares:**
   - The grid is a 4x4 grid, so it has 16 squares in total.
   - The shaded squares are those that are either in the second row or the second column.

2. **Count the shaded squares:**
   - The second row has 4 shaded squares.
   - The second column has 4 shaded squares.
   - However, the square at the intersection of the second row and the second column is counted twice, so we subtract 1 to avoid double-counting.
   - Therefore, the total number of shaded squares is \(4 + 4 - 1 = 7\).

3. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability of the disk landing in a shaded square is the number of shaded squares divided by the total number of squares.
   - So, the probability is \(\frac{7}{16}\).

Thus, the probability that the disk will land in a shaded square is \(\boxed{\frac{7}{16}}\).","[7/16, '\\frac{7}{16}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605
\]

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Thus, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

In this case, let \(x = 20^\circ\). Then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin (60^\circ - 20^\circ) \sin (60^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin (3 \cdot 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point in three-dimensional space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane (measured from the positive \( x \)-axis),
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( r \) and \( \theta \) directions, meaning it is a flat, two-dimensional surface that extends infinitely in the horizontal directions.

Therefore, the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{6}\) (or 30 degrees). Therefore, the smallest angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by understanding the relationship between the roots of \( f(x) \) and the roots of \( g(x) \). If \( r \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( g(r) = 0 \). This implies that \( f(r + 5) = 0 \), so \( r + 5 \) must be a root of \( f(x) \). Therefore, if the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

The sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) can be found using Vieta's formulas. For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx + c \), the sum of the roots is given by \(-a\). In our case, the polynomial is \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), so the sum of the roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) is:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49
\]

Since the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \), the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15 = 49 - 15 = 34

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3},

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\). Squaring both sides of the equation \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ) = (3\sqrt{3})^2\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(-\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}) = 27,

Since \(\tan^2 80^\circ = \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.

Since \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\), we have:

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   - Distribute the \(180^\circ\) in the parentheses:
     \[
     360^\circ - 180n + 360^\circ = 1070^\circ
     \]
   - Combine like terms:

4. **Isolate the term involving \(n\):**
   - Subtract \(720^\circ\) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     -180n = 1070^\circ - 720^\circ

"To solve for the monic integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t + 2 \) is the antipode of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to understand what it means for two numbers to be antipodes modulo 23. Two numbers \( a \) and \( b \) are antipodes modulo 23 if their sum is congruent to 0 modulo 23, i.e., \( a + b \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \).

Given that \( t + 2 \) is the antipode of \( t \) modulo 23, we can write:
\[ t + (t + 2) \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[ 2t + 2 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

Next, we isolate \( t \) by first subtracting 2 from both sides:
\[ 2t \equiv -2 \pmod{23} \]

Since \(-2\) is congruent to \(21\) modulo 23 (because \(-2 + 23 = 21\)), we can rewrite the congruence as:
\[ 2t \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \]

To solve for \( t \), we need to find the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23. The multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:
\[ 2x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

We can find this inverse by testing values or using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm. By inspection, we find that:
\[ 2 \times 12 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Thus, the multiplicative inverse of 2 modulo 23 is 12. We multiply both sides of the congruence \( 2t \equiv 21 \pmod{23} \) by 12:
\[ t \equiv 21 \times 12 \pmod{23} \]

Calculating the right-hand side, we get:
\[ 21 \times 12 = 252 \]

Now, we reduce 252 modulo 23:
\[ 252 \div 23 \approx 10.9565 \]
\[ 252 - 10 \times 23 = 252 - 230 = 22 \]

Therefore, \( 252 \equiv 22 \pmod{23} \), so:
\[ t \equiv 22 \pmod{23} \]

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), the solution is:
\[ t = 22 \]

Thus, the monic integer \( t \) is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",17,"[17, '17']",False
"To find the total surface area of a cube with side length 1 cubic unit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the shape and properties of a cube:**
   - A cube has 6 faces.
   - Each face of a cube is a square.
   - The area of one face of a cube is given by the square of its side length.

2. **Calculate the area of one face:**
   - The side length of the cube is 1 unit.
   - The area of one face is \( \text{side length}^2 = 1^2 = 1 \) square unit.

3. **Calculate the total surface area:**
   - Since a cube has 6 faces, we multiply the area of one face by 6.
   - Total surface area = \( 6 \times \text{area of one face} = 6 \times 1 = 6 \) square units.

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\) square units.","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we start by identifying the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a binomial \(a + b\) is \(a - b\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which follows the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

Subtracting these values gives:

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True
"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines given by \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify \(\mathbf{a}_1\), \(\mathbf{a}_2\), and \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]
Simplifying the components, we get:
\[
\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, any point \((x,y)\) within the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. The possible integer values for \(x\) are:
\[

There are 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-4\) and \(4\). Therefore, any point \((x,y)\) within the rectangle must satisfy:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product. Specifically, for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\), and any scalar \(k\), we have:

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}

\[

Applying these properties, we get:

\]

Next, we distribute each cross product:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a})

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c})

We are given \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\). Substituting these values in, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) = 2 (-\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

\[
-3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = -3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}

2. **Arrange the data in ascending order:**
   - The ordered data is: 6, 12, 12, 13

3. **Determine the median:**
   - Since there are 4 data points (an even number), the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[

This can be rewritten as:
\[

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are equal. Therefore:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. For two chords to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

2. **Count the Total Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the points are on a circle, we need to account for the rotational symmetry. This means that each arrangement can be rotated to form an equivalent arrangement. Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is \(\frac{4!}{4} = 3! = 6\).

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 distinct arrangements, only 2 will result in the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting.

This is because in these arrangements, the points \(A\) and \(B\) are separated by the points \(C\) and \(D\).

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements. Therefore, the probability is \(\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\).

Thus, the probability that the chords \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two parts: a segment of the larger circle and a segment of the smaller circle. Let's denote the angle \(\angle ADC\) by \(\theta\) (in radians).

### Area of the Segment of the Larger Circle
The area of a sector of a circle with radius \(r\) and central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector} = \frac{1}{2} r^2 \theta
\]

For the larger circle with radius 2:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)
\]

### Area of the Segment of the Smaller Circle
The radius of the smaller circle is 1, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{1}{2}\theta
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

### Total Area of the Shaded Region
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments of the larger and smaller circles:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = (2\theta - 2\sin(\theta)) + \left(\frac{1}{2}\theta - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)\right) = 2\theta + \frac{1}{2}\theta - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5}{2}\theta - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Divide both sides by \(\frac{5}{2}\):
\[
\theta - \sin(\theta) = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

We need to solve this equation for \(\theta\). By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

Thus, the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical pots are needed to contain the volume of a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical pot and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the spherical tank to the volume of the cylindrical pot.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical pot. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical pot, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical pots are required to contain the volume of the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical pot:
\[ \text{Number of pots} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical pots needed to contain the volume of the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100:
\[
\frac{3}{25} = \frac{3 \cdot 4}{25 \cdot 4} = \frac{12}{100}
\]
\[
\frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

"To determine the taximeter's tax rate in int's per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the tax rate from pi den per minute to pi den per second:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute.
   - The tax rate is 20 pi den per minute.
   - To convert to pi den per second, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ pi den}}{60 \text{ seconds}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ pi den per second}
     \]

2. **Convert the tax rate from pi den per second to int's per second:**
   - We are given that 1 pi den is equivalent to 10 int's.
   - To convert pi den per second to int's per second, we multiply by 10:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \text{ pi den per second} \times 10 \text{ int's per pi den} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ int's per second}

"To determine how many different ways we can form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 rationalists and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each group, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of rationalists or only of Democrats).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 rationalists and 6 Democrats). This is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} \), which represents the number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements without regard to the order of selection. The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is:

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists only of rationalists. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 8 rationalists:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee that consists only of Democrats. This is the number of ways to choose 5 members from the 6 Democrats:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of rationalists or only of Democrats) is the sum of the two cases calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members to get the number of ways to form a subcommittee that includes at least one member from each group:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940

Thus, the number of different ways we can form a subcommittee of 5 members that includes at least one member from each group is:

"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487)

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we multiply these two results together:

Therefore, the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\) is:

"Let the three consecutive integers be \(x-1\), \(x\), and \(x+1\). The product of these three integers is given by:

\[
(x-1)x(x+1) = 120

We are also given that this product divided by the middle number \(x\) is 24. Therefore, we can write:

\[
\frac{(x-1)x(x+1)}{x} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(x-1)(x+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
x^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

\[

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
x = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -5

We need to check both cases.

**Case 1: \(x = 5\)**

The three consecutive integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\). The product of these integers is:

\[

This satisfies the first condition. The middle number is \(5\), and the product divided by the middle number is:

\[

\]

This satisfies the second condition. Therefore, the three integers are \(4\), \(5\), and \(6\), and the largest of these integers is \(6\).

**Case 2: \(x = -5\)**

The three consecutive integers are \(-6\), \(-5\), and \(-4\). The product of these integers is:

\[
-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120
\]

This does not satisfy the first condition. Therefore, \(x = -5\) is not a valid solution.

Thus, the largest of the three consecutive integers is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x - 2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

\[

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \theta = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos \theta)
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we substitute \(AB = AC = x\) into the equation:
\[
BC^2 = 2x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)
\]
Substituting \(BC^2 = 2x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)\) into the equation for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{2x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)}{4} + 1 + x \cos 3\theta = \frac{x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)}{2} + 1 + x \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\). Therefore:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)}{2} + 1 + x \cos 3\theta
\]
By solving this equation, we find that \(\cos \theta = \frac{3}{5}\). Therefore, \(\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} = \frac{4}{5}\).

Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle ABC\), we get:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \theta} = \frac{AB}{\sin \angle ACB} = \frac{AC}{\sin \angle ABC} = \frac{x}{\sin \left(\frac{\pi - \theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{x}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we have:
\[
BC = x \cdot \frac{\sin \theta}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = x \cdot \frac{2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}}{\cos \frac{\theta}{2}} = 2x \sin \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
Since \(\sin \frac{\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \cos \theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 - \frac{3}{5}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{\frac{2}{5}}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{5}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\), we have:
\[
BC = 2x \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5}
\]
The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = x + x + \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2x + \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2x \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}\right) = 2x \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{5}\right)
\]
Since \(AM = 11\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, we use the area of \(\triangle ABC\) in two ways:
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot BC \cdot AM = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5} \cdot 11 = \frac{11x \sqrt{5}}{5}
\]
\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{2x^2}{5}
\]
Equating the two expressions for the area, we get:
\[
\frac{11x \sqrt{5}}{5} = \frac{2x^2}{5}
\]
Multiplying both sides by 5, we get:
\[
11x \sqrt{5} = 2x^2
\]
Dividing both sides by \(x\) (assuming \(x \neq 0\)), we get:
\[
11 \sqrt{5} = 2x
\]
Solving for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{11 \sqrt{5}}{2}
\]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer be \(a\). The 27 consecutive integers can then be expressed as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of these 27 integers is given by the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms. Here, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
3^7 = \frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
2187 = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
To solve for \(a\), we divide both sides by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The 27 consecutive integers are therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence. The 14th number is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81
\]
Thus, the median of the 27 consecutive positive integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals determined by the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, -7) \), \( (-7, 3) \), and \( (3, \infty) \). However, since \(y = x^2 \geq 0\), we only need to test the interval \( [0, 3) \).

For \(0 \leq y < 3\), we can choose a test point, say \(y = 1\):
\[ (1)^2 + 4(1) - 21 = 1 + 4 - 21 = -16 \]
Since \(-16 < 0\), the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is true for \(0 \leq y < 3\).

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we convert back to \(x\):
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answer

Combining the results from both steps, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[ \boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})} \]","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substitute \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substitute \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which class has the most students who use the calculator more than \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator for each class and compare it to the number of students who use the calculator.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator for each class:

1. **9th class:**
   - Number of students who do not use the calculator: \(300 \times (1 - 0.394) = 300 \times 0.606 = 181.8\)
   - \(135\%\) of 181.8: \(181.8 \times 1.35 = 245.85\)
   - Number of students who use the calculator: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3\)
   - Since \(123.3 < 245.85\), the 9th class does not have the most students who use the calculator more than \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator.

2. **10th class:**
   - Number of students who do not use the calculator: \(300 \times (1 - 0.331) = 300 \times 0.669 = 200.7\)
   - \(135\%\) of 200.7: \(200.7 \times 1.35 = 270.945\)
   - Number of students who use the calculator: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2\)
   - Since \(103.2 < 270.945\), the 10th class does not have the most students who use the calculator more than \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator.

3. **11th class:**
   - Number of students who do not use the calculator: \(300 \times (1 - 0.138) = 300 \times 0.862 = 258.6\)
   - \(135\%\) of 258.6: \(258.6 \times 1.35 = 348.69\)
   - Number of students who use the calculator: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8\)
   - Since \(61.8 < 348.69\), the 11th class does not have the most students who use the calculator more than \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator.

4. **12th class:**
   - Number of students who do not use the calculator: \(300 \times (1 - 0.086) = 300 \times 0.914 = 274.2\)
   - \(135\%\) of 274.2: \(274.2 \times 1.35 = 368.07\)
   - Number of students who use the calculator: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\)
   - Since \(34.8 < 368.07\), the 12th class does not have the most students who use the calculator more than \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not use the calculator.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the area of the largest possible rectangle within the given shape, we need to analyze the structure of the shape. The shape consists of a rectangle with two semicircles attached to its top and bottom sides. The total length of the sigma is 400 meters. Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width of the rectangle by \( w \). Since each semicircle has a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, the total length of the sigma is given by:

\[ l + 2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = l + \pi w = 400 \]

We need to express the area of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area \( A \) of the rectangle is:

\[ A = l \times w \]

From the equation \( l + \pi w = 400 \), we can solve for \( l \):

\[ l = 400 - \pi w \]

Substituting this expression for \( l \) into the area formula, we get:

\[ A = (400 - \pi w) \times w = 400w - \pi w^2 \]

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \), and it represents a downward-opening parabola. The maximum area occurs at the vertex of the parabola. The vertex of a parabola given by \( A = -\pi w^2 + 400w \) is at:

\[ w = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{400}{2(-\pi)} = \frac{400}{2\pi} = \frac{200}{\pi} \]

Substituting \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( l \), we get:

\[ l = 400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right) = 400 - 200 = 200 \]

Now, we can calculate the area of the rectangle:

\[ A = l \times w = 200 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{40000}{\pi} \]

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \(RST\) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by identifying the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(R\).

5^2 = 2^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
25 = 4 + ST^2
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
ST^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since \(ST\) is a length):
\[
ST = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of angle \(T\) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite angle \(T\) to the length of the hypotenuse. In triangle \(RST\), the side opposite angle \(T\) is \(RS = 2\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\). Therefore:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}\).","[2/5, '\\frac{2}{5}']",\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5},[],False
"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The distance is expressed in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's solve for \( f(x) = 0 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**

Here, \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[
3 - x = 0 \implies x = 3
\]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**

Here, \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 0 \), we get:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-x^2 + 2x + 3) = 0
\]
This gives us three solutions: \( x = 0 \), \( x = -1 \), and \( x = 3 \). However, since we are considering the case where \( x > 3 \), none of these solutions are valid in this range. Therefore, there is no solution for \( f(x) = 0 \) in the range \( x > 3 \).

From the above, we conclude that \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's solve for \( f(x) = 6 \).

**Case 1: \( x \leq 3 \)**

Here, \( f(x) = 3 - x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \), we get:
\[
3 - x = 6 \implies x = -3
\]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies the condition \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

**Case 2: \( x > 3 \)**

Here, \( f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \). Setting \( f(x) = 6 \), we get:
\[
-x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \implies x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 = 0
\]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Testing \( x = 2 \):
\[
2^3 - 2 \cdot 2^2 - 3 \cdot 2 + 6 = 8 - 8 - 6 + 6 = 0
\]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, since we are considering the case where \( x > 3 \), \( x = 2 \) is not a valid solution. We can factor \( x^3 - 2x^2 - 3x + 6 \) as \( (x - 2)(x^2 - 3) \). Setting \( x^2 - 3 = 0 \), we get:
\[
x^2 = 3 \implies x = \sqrt{3} \text{ or } x = -\sqrt{3}
\]
Since neither \( \sqrt{3} \) nor \( -\sqrt{3} \) satisfies the condition \( x > 3 \), there are no solutions for \( f(x) = 6 \) in the range \( x > 3 \).

From the above, we conclude that \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum the values of \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[
f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0

"Given a point \( P \) inside a regular octahedron with edge length \( a \), the sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to all vertices of the octahedron is constant and equal to \( 4a^2 \times \frac{3}{2} = 6a^2 \). Let the distances from \( P \) to the vertices be \( d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8 \). We know that \( d_1 = 3 \), \( d_2 = 7 \), \( d_3 = 8 \), \( d_4 = 9 \), and \( d_5 = 11 \). We need to find \( d_6 \).

The sum of the squares of the distances is:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 + d_5^2 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2 = 6a^2
\]
Since the octahedron is regular, the distances from \( P \) to the vertices can be paired such that each pair sums to the same value. This means:
\[
d_1^2 + d_8^2 = d_2^2 + d_7^2 = d_3^2 + d_6^2 = d_4^2 + d_5^2
\]
We can calculate \( d_4^2 + d_5^2 \):
\[
d_4^2 + d_5^2 = 9^2 + 11^2 = 81 + 121 = 202
\]
Therefore, \( d_3^2 + d_6^2 = 202 \). We know \( d_3 = 8 \), so:
\[
d_3^2 = 8^2 = 64
\]
Thus:
\[
d_6^2 = 202 - 64 = 138

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
d_6 = \sqrt{138}

Therefore, the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex is:

"To determine the ratio of the extension of the spring when the Tzene� uses a 200 g mass to the extension when the Tzak uses a 150 g mass, we start by using Hooke's Law, which states that the force exerted by a spring is proportional to the extension of the spring. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = kx \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( k \) is the spring constant, and \( x \) is the extension of the spring.

The force exerted by the spring is also equal to the weight of the mass, which is given by:

\[ F = mg \]

where \( m \) is the mass and \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, we can equate the two expressions for the force:

\[ mg = kx \]

Solving for the extension \( x \), we get:

\[ x = \frac{mg}{k} \]

This equation tells us that the extension of the spring is directly proportional to the mass of the object attached to it. Therefore, the ratio of the extension of the spring when the Tzene� uses a 200 g mass to the extension when the Tzak uses a 150 g mass is:

\[ \frac{x_{\text{Tzene�}}}{x_{\text{Tzak}}} = \frac{\frac{m_{\text{Tzene�}} g}{k}}{\frac{m_{\text{Tzak}} g}{k}} = \frac{m_{\text{Tzene�}}}{m_{\text{Tzak}}} \]

Substituting the given masses, we get:

\[ \frac{x_{\text{Tzene�}}}{x_{\text{Tzak}}} = \frac{200 \text{ g}}{150 \text{ g}} = \frac{4}{3} \]

Thus, the ratio of the extension of the spring when the Tzene� uses a 200 g mass to the extension when the Tzak uses a 150 g mass is:

"To determine how many common digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:

2. Each male student shakes hands with each female student.
3. No male student shakes hands with another male student.
4. No female student shakes hands with another female student.
5. One male student does not shake hands with one female student.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of possible handshakes if there were no restrictions:**
   - Each of the 12 male students can shake hands with each of the 10 female students.

2. **Account for the restriction that one male student does not shake hands with one female student:**
   - Since one male student does not shake hands with one female student, we need to subtract this one handshake from the total number of handshakes.

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

"To find the minimum distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point is \((6, 0)\), so \(x_1 = 6\) and \(y_1 = 0\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which tell us the following about the roots of the polynomial:

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We are interested in the expression \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \). Let's denote this expression by \( S_1 \), \( \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \) by \( S_2 \), and \( \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \) by \( S_3 \). From Vieta's formulas, we know:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \). We can express \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).

Expanding this product, we get:

\]

Since \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2 \), we have:
\[
\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = (-2)^2 = 4.
\]

Thus,
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 4.

We can rewrite \( \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 \) as:
\[
\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Using Vieta's formulas again, we know:
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 = -\alpha_4, \quad \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 = -\alpha_3, \quad \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -\alpha_2.
\]

Thus,
\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (-\alpha_4)^2 + (-\alpha_3)^2 + (-\alpha_2)^2 = \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2.
\]

We can express \( \alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2 \) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) - \alpha_1^2.

Since \( \alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2 \) and \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \), we have:
\[
\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2 = (-2)^2 - 2 \cdot 0 - \alpha_1^2 = 4 - \alpha_1^2.
\]

Thus,
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4 - \alpha_1^2 + 4 = 8 - \alpha_1^2.

Since \( \alpha_1^2 \) is a positive real number, \( S_1 S_2 S_3 = 8 - \alpha_1^2 \) is less than 8. Therefore, the only possible value for \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) is 4.

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to any vertex, we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all inequalities, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe four regions in the rectangle:
1. \(ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
2. \(ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
3. \(ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
4. \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

The intersection of these regions forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with vertices at:
\[
\left( \pm \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}, \pm \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} \right)
\]

The area of this smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area} = \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \right) \left( \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} \right) = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
\text{Area} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}
\]

Given \(k = \frac{a}{b}\), we have \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression, we get:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4(kb)^2} = \frac{k^2b^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4k^2b^2} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}
\]

Combining the terms, we have:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4k^2} = \frac{k^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{k^2}}{4}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:

"To find the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm, which states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that \(a = bq + r\) and \(0 \leq r < b\).

Here, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:
\[54 = 6q + r\]
where \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):
\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
Subtracting 54 from both sides, we get:
\[r = 0\]

Therefore, the remainder when 54 is divided by 6 is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how many dollars more the total amount of money collected from the students is compared to the amount needed to buy the calculators, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money collected from the students.
2. Calculate the total cost of the calculators.
3. Find the difference between the total amount collected and the total cost of the calculators.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money collected from the students:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money collected from the students is $126.59.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the calculators. Since each calculator costs $25 and there are 4 calculators, the total cost is:
\[
4 \times 25 = 100
\]

Now, we find the difference between the total amount collected and the total cost of the calculators:
\[
126.59 - 100 = 26.59
\]

Therefore, the students collected \(\boxed{26.59}\) dollars more than the amount needed to buy the calculators.","[26.5900000000000, '26.59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the mean score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score. We know that:
- 20 students scored 80.
- 8 students scored 90.
- 2 students scored 100.

So, the total score is:
\[ 20 \times 80 + 8 \times 90 + 2 \times 100 \]

Now, let's do the multiplications:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Next, we add these amounts together to get the total score:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Now, we divide the total score by the number of students, which is 30:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

Therefore, the mean score of the class is:
\[ \boxed{84} \]","[84, '84']",84,"[84, '84']",True
"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\
\hline}
\end{array}
\]
The sum of the first row is:
\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]
The sum of the second row is:
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the first column is:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the third column is:
\[
8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]
Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many more podes the Tzimeter perimeters than the Martha, we need to calculate the perimeter of each and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the Tzimeter. The Tzimeter perimeters a diagonal of the rectangular field, which is 300 podes by 400 podes. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ podes}
\]
The Tzimeter perimeters this diagonal, so the total length of the perimeter he covers is:
\[
2 \times 500 = 1000 \text{ podes}
\]

Next, let's calculate the perimeter of the Martha. The Martha perimeters the entire field, which is a rectangle with a length of 400 podes and a width of 300 podes. The perimeter of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (400 + 300) = 2 \times 700 = 1400 \text{ podes}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the perimeter of the Martha and the perimeter of the Tzimeter:
\[
1400 - 1000 = 400 \text{ podes}

Therefore, the Martha perimeters \(\boxed{400}\) more podes than the Tzimeter.","[400, '400']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real root.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the smallest distance from a point \( A \) to a line segment \( BC \), we need to consider the following cases:

1. The point \( A \) is closest to one of the endpoints of the line segment \( BC \).
2. The point \( A \) is closest to a point on the line segment \( BC \) that is not an endpoint.

Let's denote the coordinates of points \( A \), \( B \), and \( C \) as \( A = (x_1, y_1) \), \( B = (x_2, y_2) \), and \( C = (x_3, y_3) \).

### Case 1: Point \( A \) is closest to one of the endpoints
The distance from \( A \) to \( B \) is given by:
\[
d_{AB} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}
\]
The distance from \( A \) to \( C \) is given by:
\[
d_{AC} = \sqrt{(x_1 - x_3)^2 + (y_1 - y_3)^2}
\]

### Case 2: Point \( A \) is closest to a point on the line segment \( BC \) that is not an endpoint
To find the point on the line segment \( BC \) that is closest to \( A \), we first need to find the parametric equation of the line segment \( BC \). The parametric equation of the line passing through \( B \) and \( C \) can be written as:
\[
(x, y) = (x_2 + t(x_3 - x_2), y_2 + t(y_3 - y_2))
\]
where \( t \) is a parameter such that \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \).

The distance from \( A \) to a point on the line segment \( BC \) is given by:
\[
d(t) = \sqrt{(x_1 - (x_2 + t(x_3 - x_2)))^2 + (y_1 - (y_2 + t(y_3 - y_2)))^2}
\]
To minimize \( d(t) \), we need to find the value of \( t \) that minimizes \( d(t)^2 \):
\[
d(t)^2 = (x_1 - x_2 - t(x_3 - x_2))^2 + (y_1 - y_2 - t(y_3 - y_2))^2
\]
Taking the derivative of \( d(t)^2 \) with respect to \( t \) and setting it to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{d}{dt} \left[ (x_1 - x_2 - t(x_3 - x_2))^2 + (y_1 - y_2 - t(y_3 - y_2))^2 \right] = 0
\]
\[
2(x_1 - x_2 - t(x_3 - x_2))(-x_3 + x_2) + 2(y_1 - y_2 - t(y_3 - y_2))(-y_3 + y_2) = 0
\]
\[
-(x_1 - x_2)(x_3 - x_2) - t(x_3 - x_2)^2 - (y_1 - y_2)(y_3 - y_2) - t(y_3 - y_2)^2 = 0

\[
-t((x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2) = (x_1 - x_2)(x_3 - x_2) + (y_1 - y_2)(y_3 - y_2)
\]
\[
t = \frac{(x_1 - x_2)(x_3 - x_2) + (y_1 - y_2)(y_3 - y_2)}{(x_3 - x_2)^2 + (y_3 - y_2)^2}
\]
We need to check if \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \). If \( t \) is within this range, then the closest point on the line segment \( BC \) to \( A \) is:
\[
(x, y) = (x_2 + t(x_3 - x_2), y_2 + t(y_3 - y_2))
\]
The distance from \( A \) to this point is:
\[
d(t) = \sqrt{(x_1 - (x_2 + t(x_3 - x_2)))^2 + (y_1 - (y_2 + t(y_3 - y_2)))^2}
\]

### Conclusion
The smallest distance from \( A \) to the line segment \( BC \) is the minimum of the distances \( d_{AB} \), \( d_{AC} \), and \( d(t) \) where \( t \) is given by the formula above and \( 0 \leq t \leq 1 \).

Thus, the smallest distance is:
