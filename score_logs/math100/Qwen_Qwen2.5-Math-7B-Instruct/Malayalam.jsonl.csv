"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying this equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians around the point \( c \), we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   Multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method), we have:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

\[\boxed{11\sqrt{2}}\]","[11*sqrt(2), '11\\sqrt{2}']",11\sqrt2,"[11, '11']",False
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a line such that 3 specific people (let's call them A, B, and C) are not next to each other. We will use the principle of complementary counting, which means we will first calculate the total number of arrangements and then subtract the number of arrangements where A, B, and C are next to each other.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of arrangements of 8 people.**

The total number of ways to arrange 8 people in a line is given by the factorial of 8, denoted as \(8!\):
\[
8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of arrangements where A, B, and C are next to each other.**

To treat A, B, and C as a single ""block,"" we can think of this block as a single unit along with the other 5 people. This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) in a line, which can be done in \(6!\) ways:
\[
6! = 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 720
\]
Within the block, A, B, and C can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways:
\[
3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6
\]
Therefore, the total number of arrangements where A, B, and C are next to each other is:
\[
6! \times 3! = 720 \times 6 = 4320
\]

**Step 3: Subtract the number of arrangements where A, B, and C are next to each other from the total number of arrangements.**

The number of arrangements where A, B, and C are not next to each other is:
\[
8! - 6! \times 3! = 40320 - 4320 = 36000
\]

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people in a line such that A, B, and C are not next to each other is:
\[
\boxed{36000}

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. For a term to be constant, the exponent of \(x\) must be zero. Let's determine the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\) is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

For the term to be constant, we set the exponent of \(x\) to zero:

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

Solving for \(k\):

\[
15 = 5k
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]

Simplify each part:

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10
\]

\[
(10x^3)^2 = 10^2 x^{3 \cdot 2} = 100 x^6
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = (-1)^3 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-2 \cdot 3} = -\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}
\]

Combining these results:

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 x^6 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8} x^{-6}\right) = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) \cdot x^6 \cdot x^{-6}
\]

Since \(x^6 \cdot x^{-6} = 1\):

\[
T_3 = 10 \cdot 100 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = 1000 \cdot \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right) = -125
\]

Therefore, the constant term in the expansion is:

\boxed{-125}

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, substitute these values back into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]
\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24
\]

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3
\]

Thus, the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the number of degrees in the interior angle of a regular pentagon, we can use the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon. The formula is:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

where \( n \) is the number of sides of the polygon. For a pentagon, \( n = 5 \). Plugging in the value of \( n \), we get:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

Since a regular pentagon has all interior angles equal, we can find the measure of each interior angle by dividing the sum of the interior angles by the number of sides:

\[
\text{Measure of each interior angle} = \frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
\]

Therefore, the number of degrees in the interior angle of a regular pentagon is \(\boxed{108}\).","[108, '108']",72,"[72, '72']",False
"Given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\), and then determine the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \(A(5, 3)\), \(B(6, 8)\), \(C(7, 4)\), and \(D(x, y)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2} \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, the midpoint of \(AC\) is not the midpoint of \(BD\). Let's consider the other possibility where \(B\) and \(C\) are opposite vertices.

The midpoint of the diagonal \(AB\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal \(CD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = \frac{11}{2} \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

This does not satisfy \(x > 7\).

Finally, let's consider the possibility where \(A\) and \(C\) are opposite vertices.

The midpoint of the diagonal \(AC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal \(BD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = \left( 6, \frac{7}{2} \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = \frac{7}{2}
\]

Solving the first equation:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation:
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = \指出 \implies 8+y = 7 \implJKLM y = -1

We are given:
\[
\sin A = 2\cos A
\]

Substitute \(\sin A\) in the tangent formula:

"To find the vertical asymptotes and the horizontal asymptote of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the vertical asymptotes:**
   Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator is zero, as long as the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \).

   The quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x - 14 \) can be factored as:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x - 7)(x + 2)
   \]
   Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
   \[
   x - 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 2 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -2
   \]
   Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

2. **Find the horizontal asymptote:**
   Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1 and the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

3. **Calculate \( a + b + c \):**
   Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
   \[
   a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5
   \]

Therefore, the value of \( a + b + c \) is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",5,"[5, '5']",True
"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but with a slight modification. Instead of \(99^2 + 2 \cdot 99 \cdot 1 + 1^2\), we have \(99^2 + 99 + 1\). However, we can still use a similar approach by recognizing that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\]

This is a known algebraic identity for the sum of a geometric series. The expression \(100^3 - 1\) can be factored as:
\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1)\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{(100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99} = \frac{99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1)}{99} = 100^2 + 100 + 1\]

Now, we just need to calculate \(100^2 + 100 + 1\):
\[100^2 + 100 + 1 = 10000 + 100 + 1 = 10101\]

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{10101}\).","[10101, '10101']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False
"To find the smallest positive constant \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we start by letting \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then, the matrix-vector product is

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of this vector is

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of the expression \(\frac{\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}\). This is equivalent to finding the maximum value of

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}{x^2 + y^2}}.
\]

Let \( t = \frac{x}{y} \). Then, the expression becomes

\[
\sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}}.
\]

We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \). To do this, we take the derivative of \( f(t) \) and set it to zero. The derivative is

\[
f'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get

\[
-12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0.
\]

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):

\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \). We evaluate \( f(t) \) at these points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{4\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{2} \right) + 13}{\left( \frac{1}{2} \right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,
\]

\[
f(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,

\[
\lim_{t \to \pm \infty} f(t) = \lim_{t \to \pm \infty} \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} = 4.

In this problem, the base is 1 and the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will always be 1 regardless of the value of the exponent.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert both numbers from base 9 to base 10.**
2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10.**
3. **Convert the result back to base 9.**

### Step 1: Convert \(58_9\) to base 10

The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
5 \cdot 9^1 = 5 \cdot 9 = 45
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Add these values together:
\[
45 + 8 = 53
\]

So, \(58_9\) in base 10 is \(53_{10}\).

### Step 2: Convert \(18_9\) to base 10

The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be expanded as follows:
\[
18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0
\]

Calculate each term:
\[
1 \cdot 9^1 = 1 \cdot 9 = 9
\]
\[
8 \cdot 9^0 = 8 \cdot 1 = 8
\]

Add these values together:
\[
9 + 8 = 17
\]

So, \(18_9\) in base 10 is \(17_{10}\).

### Step 3: Perform the subtraction in base 10

Subtract the base 10 equivalents:
\[
53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
\]

### Step 4: Convert \(36_{10}\) back to base 9

To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we repeatedly divide by 9 and keep track of the remainders:

\[
36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{with a remainder of} \quad 0
\]

Since the quotient is 4 and the remainder is 0, we write the remainders in reverse order to get the base 9 number:
\[
36_{10} = 40_9

Thus, the final answer is:

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"Let's denote the weight of a tree as \( T \), the weight of a fish as \( F \), and the weight of a bird as \( B \). According to the problem, we have the following equations:

1. \( 3T + 2F + B = 2T + 3F + B \)
2. \( 2T + F + F = T + B + B \)

First, let's simplify the first equation:
\[ 3T + 2F + B = 2T + 3F + B \]
Subtract \( B \) from both sides:
\[ 3T + 2F = 2T + 3F \]
Subtract \( 2T \) from both sides:
\[ T = F \]
So, the weight of a tree is equal to the weight of a fish. We can substitute \( F \) with \( T \) in the second equation:
\[ 2T + T + T = T + B + B \]
Simplify the left side:
\[ 4T = T + 2B \]
Subtract \( T \) from both sides:
\[ 3T = 2B \]
Solve for \( B \):
\[ B = \frac{3T}{2} \]
So, the weight of a bird is \( \frac{3T}{2} \).

Now, we need to find out how many trees are equivalent to the weight of one bird and one fish. The weight of one bird and one fish is:
\[ B + F = \frac{3T}{2} + T = \frac{3T}{2} + \frac{2T}{2} = \frac{5T}{2} \]
We need to find how many trees, \( x \), have the same weight as \( \frac{5T}{2} \):
\[ xT = \frac{5T}{2} \]
Divide both sides by \( T \):
\[ x = \frac{5}{2} \]
So, the weight of one bird and one fish is equivalent to the weight of \( \frac{5}{2} \) trees. Therefore, the number of trees that have the same weight as one bird and one fish is:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

We will expand the left-hand side and then compare the coefficients with the right-hand side.

First, expand the product:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

Using the distributive property (FOIL method for polynomials), we get:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)

Combine like terms:

Now, compare the coefficients of the expanded polynomial with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\):

1. For \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12

2. For \(t^3\):
\[

3. For \(t^2\):
\[

\]

4. For \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. For the constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

Solve each equation step by step:

1. From \(-2a = 6\):
\[
a = \frac{6}{-2} = -3
\]

2. Substitute \(a = -3\) into \(3b + 20 = 26\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 26 - 20
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = \frac{6}{3} = 2

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). Therefore, \(a + b\) is:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

To isolate \( r^2 \), we can divide both sides of the equation by \( 4\pi \):

"To determine the value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has no vertical asymptotes and is continuous at \(x = a\), we need to analyze the behavior of the function at \(x = a\).

The function \(f(x)\) is defined piecewise as:
\[ f(x) = \begin{cases} ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\ ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a. \end{cases} \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\) must equal the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\), and both must equal \(f(a)\). Therefore, we need:
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = f(a). \]

First, we find the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^-} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^-} (ax + 2a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a. \]

Next, we find the right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(a\):
\[ \lim_{x \to a^+} f(x) = \lim_{x \to a^+} (ax^2) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]

For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two limits must be equal:
\[ a^2 + 2a = a^3. \]

Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a = 0. \]

Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) = 0. \]

Next, we factor the quadratic expression \(a^2 - a - 2\):
\[ a^2 - a - 2 = (a - 2)(a + 1). \]

So the equation becomes:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0. \]

The solutions to this equation are:
\[ a = 0, \quad a = 2, \quad a = -1. \]

We need to check which of these values of \(a\) ensures that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) has no vertical asymptotes. A vertical asymptote occurs where the function approaches infinity or negative infinity as \(x\) approaches some value. Since \(f(x)\) is a polynomial in each piece, it does not approach infinity or negative infinity at any finite value of \(x\). Therefore, the function has no vertical asymptotes for any value of \(a\).

However, we are asked to find the value of \(a\) such that the function is continuous at \(x = a\). From our solutions, we see that \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\) all make the function continuous at \(x = a\). The problem asks for the greatest value of \(a\), so we choose:

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:

Solving for \( c \):

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[

This gives us two cases:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).
For \(x = 0\) to be a solution, it must not be a fixed point of period 2, so we need to check if \(f(0) = 0\), which is true. Therefore, \(x = 0\) is not a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\).

Now, we need to solve the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\). Let's expand and simplify:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda x^3).
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 - 1 = 0.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^3 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which this equation has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\). By inspection, we can see that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\), so it cannot be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) with \(f(x) \neq x\). Therefore, we need to check if there are other solutions.

By analyzing the behavior of the function and the polynomial, we find that the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\) has a solution \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) if and only if \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the function becomes \(f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2\), and we can verify that \(f(f(x)) = x\) has a solution \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) such that \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2}\), but \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \neq \frac{1}{2}\) is not true. Therefore, the correct value is \(\lambda = 2\).

Thus, the value of \(\lambda\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']","(3,4]",[],False
"To solve the given expression for \(\theta\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get:
\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ
\]
So the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ
\]
We can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get:
\[
\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ
\]
So the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]
We can use the tangent addition formula, \(\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}\), to express the right-hand side in a different form. Notice that:
\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ \quad \text{and} \quad \sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ
\]
So we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}
\]
Using the sum-to-product identities, \(\sin A + \sin B = 2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)\) and \(\cos A - \cos B = -2 \sin\left(\frac{A+B}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{A-B}{2}\right)\), we get:
\[
\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ = 2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \cos\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cos 30^\circ = 2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ
\]
\[
\cos 65^\circ - \cos 5^\circ = -2 \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ + 5^\circ}{2}\right) \sin\left(\frac{65^\circ - 5^\circ}{2}\right) = -2 \sin 35^\circ \sin 30^\circ = -2 \sin 35^\circ \cdot \frac{1}{2} = -\sin 35^\circ
\]
So the expression becomes:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sqrt{3} \sin 35^\circ}{-\sin 35^\circ} = -\sqrt{3}
\]
The angle \(\theta\) whose tangent is \(-\sqrt{3}\) is \(120^\circ\) (since \(\tan 120^\circ = -\sqrt{3}\) and we are asked for the positive angle less than \(180^\circ\)).

"To determine the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE,"" we need to consider the fact that some of the letters are repeated. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter E appears 4 times, the letter L appears 2 times, the letter I appears 1 time, and the letter P appears 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- \( n = 8 \) (total letters)
- \( n_1 = 4 \) (for E)
- \( n_2 = 2 \) (for L)
- \( n_3 = 1 \) (for I)
- \( n_4 = 1 \) (for P)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{8!}{4! \cdot 2! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40320 \)
- \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \)
- \( 2! = 2 \times 1 = 2 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \)

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[
\frac{40320}{24 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1} = \frac{40320}{48} = 840
\]

Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). The function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \]
\[ 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \]
\[ 4x^2 = 2 \]
\[ x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \]
\[ x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into the function \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1 \]
Similarly, substituting \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into the function \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1 \]
Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is 1.

To confirm that 1 is indeed the maximum value, we can use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le (x^2 + y^2)(1 - y^2 + 1 - x^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(2 - x^2 - y^2) \]
Let \( u = x^2 + y^2 \). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le u(2 - u) \]
The function \( u(2 - u) \) is a quadratic function that opens downwards and reaches its maximum value at \( u = 1 \). Therefore:
\[ u(2 - u) \le 1 \cdot (2 - 1) = 1 \]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \le 1 \]
Thus, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) is indeed 1.

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) divided by 2. The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is given by the determinant of the following matrix:

We can expand this determinant along the first row:

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = re^{i\theta} \). Since \(z\) is a complex number and \(z + \frac{1}{z}\) is real, \(z\) must lie on the unit circle, so \(r = 1\). Thus, we can write \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Therefore,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Thus, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i(85\pi/5)} = e^{i17\pi} = e^{i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i(85\pi/5)} = e^{-i17\pi} = e^{-i(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \), so:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

We are given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 square units. We need to find the area of triangle \(.EG\), where \(M\) and \(N\) are points on \(AB\) and \(AC\) respectively, such that \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through \(G\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) with a similarity ratio of 2:3 (because the centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, and \(G\) is the centroid).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\).

Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144 square units, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64 \text{ square units}

Now, we need to find the area of triangle \(EGN\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the median \(CF\) into a ratio of 2:1, with \(CG = \frac{2}{3}CF\) and \(GF = \frac{1}{3}CF\). This means that triangle \(EGN\) is similar to triangle \(AMN\) with a similarity ratio of 1:2 (because \(G\) divides \(CF\) in the ratio 2:1, and \(EG\) is half of \(CG\)).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of triangle \(EGN\) to triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{4}\).

Since the area of triangle \(AMN\) is 64 square units, the area of triangle \(EGN\) is:

We now have a system of linear equations:

To eliminate \(a_1\), subtract the first equation from the second:

"To determine how many positive integers between 100 and 150 are even and have exactly two distinct digits, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the range of even numbers between 100 and 150.
2. Check each even number to see if it has exactly two distinct digits.

The even numbers between 100 and 150 are: 100, 102, 104, 106, 108, 110, 112, 114, 116, 118, 120, 122, 124, 126, 128, 130, 132, 134, 136, 138, 140, 142, 144, 146, 148, 150.

"To determine how many positive integers \( n > 1 \) make \( 2^{24} \) a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:

There are 7 divisors in this list. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

"To determine how many five cent coins are there, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let:
- \( x \) be the number of five cent coins.
- \( y \) be the number of ten cent coins.

We are given two pieces of information:
1. The total number of coins is 100.
2. The total value of the coins is 750 cents.

We can translate these pieces of information into the following system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 100 \)
2. \( 5x + 10y = 750 \)

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + 2y = 150 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
1. \( x + y = 100 \)
2. \( x + 2y = 150 \)

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( x \):
\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 150 - 100 \]
\[ x + 2y - x - y = 50 \]
\[ y = 50 \]

Now that we know \( y = 50 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to solve for \( x \):
\[ x + 50 = 100 \]
\[ x = 100 - 50 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

Therefore, the number of five cent coins is \(\boxed{50}\).","[50, '50']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"Let's denote the four numbers as \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). According to the problem, each number is distinct and none of them is zero. The condition given is that the sum of the four numbers is equal to the sum of the products of each pair of numbers. This can be written as:

\[a + b + c + d = ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd\]

To solve this equation, we can rearrange it to:

\[a + b + c + d - ab - ac - ad - bc - bd - cd = 0\]

We can add 1 to both sides of the equation and then factor the left side:

\[1 + a + b + c + d - ab - ac - ad - bc - bd - cd = 1\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[1 - ab - ac - ad - bc - bd - cd + a + b + c + d = 1\]

"To determine the area of the shaded region in the given grid, we need to analyze the two shaded triangles and calculate their areas separately before summing them up.

### Step 1: Identify the vertices of the triangles
The grid is a 4x5 grid, with each square having a side length of 1 unit.

- The first shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\).
- The second shaded triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\).

### Step 2: Calculate the area of the first triangle
The base of the first triangle is the horizontal distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((2, 0)\), which is 2 units.
The height of the first triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_1\) of a triangle is given by:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the area of the second triangle
The base of the second triangle is the horizontal distance from \((3, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\), which is 3 units.
The height of the second triangle is the vertical distance from \((0, 0)\) to \((3, 0)\), which is 4 units.

The area \(A_2\) of a triangle is given by:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6 \text{ square units}
\]

### Step 4: Sum the areas of the two triangles
The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two triangles:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 6 = 10 \text{ square units}

"To solve the problem, we need to find a number such that when it is multiplied by 450, the result is a number with the same digits in the same order, but with each digit increased by 1 (with the digit 9 increasing to 0 and the digit 0 increasing to 9).

Let's denote the original number by \( x \). The condition given is:
\[ 450x = y \]
where \( y \) is the number formed by increasing each digit of \( x \) by 1.

First, let's consider the possible range of \( x \). Since \( y \) is formed by increasing each digit of \( x \) by 1, \( y \) must be at least 10 times \( x \) (if \( x \) is a single-digit number) and at most 9 times \( x \) plus a few more (if \( x \) is a multi-digit number). However, since \( y \) is exactly 450 times \( x \), \( x \) must be a number such that \( 450x \) is also a number with the same digits in the same order but increased by 1.

Let's test some possible values of \( x \):

1. If \( x = 2025 \):
   \[ 450 \times 2025 = 911250 \]
   The digits of 911250 are 9, 1, 1, 2, 5, 0, which are the digits of 2025 increased by 1. Therefore, \( x = 2025 \) satisfies the condition.

To confirm that there are no other possible values of \( x \), we need to check if there are any other numbers that satisfy the condition. Since \( y \) must be exactly 450 times \( x \) and the digits of \( y \) must be the digits of \( x \) increased by 1, \( x \) must be a number that, when multiplied by 450, results in a number with the same digits in the same order but increased by 1. The only number that satisfies this condition is \( x = 2025 \).

\[5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000.\]
So the fraction becomes:
\[\frac{4321}{20000000}.\]

Next, we convert this fraction into a decimal by performing the division:
\[4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605.\]

Now, we need to identify the last three digits of the decimal. The decimal \(0.00021605\) has the last three digits \(005\).

Finally, we sum these last three digits:
\[0 + 0 + 5 = 5.\]

Thus, the sum of the last three digits is \(\boxed{5}\).","[5, '5']",14,"[14, '14']",False
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

\[
\frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape of the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, \( r \) represents the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis, \( \theta \) represents the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, and \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane. The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is constant for all points on the surface. This describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

Therefore, the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we can use the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Therefore, the angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\) is:

"Given the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we need to find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \).

First, let's recall the relationship between the roots of a polynomial and its coefficients. For a cubic polynomial \( f(x) = a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \) is given by:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{a_2}{a_3}
\]

For the given polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we identify the coefficients:
\[
a_3 = 1, \quad a_2 = -49, \quad a_1 = 623, \quad a_0 = -2015
\]

Using the formula for the sum of the roots, we find:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = -\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Next, we consider the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the values of \( x \) for which \( g(x) = 0 \). This means:
\[
f(x + 5) = 0
\]

If \( r \) is a root of \( g(x) \), then \( x + 5 = r_i \) for some root \( r_i \) of \( f(x) \). Therefore, \( x = r_i - 5 \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \).

To find the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we sum these roots:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5)
\]

Distribute the summation:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 5 - 5 - 5
\]

Simplify the expression:
\[
r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 15
\]

We already know that \( r_1 + r_2 + r_3 = 49 \). Substitute this value in:
\[
49 - 15 = 34

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\).

For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 40^\circ = \tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \sqrt{3} \tan 20^\circ}\). For \(x = 10^\circ\), we have \(\tan 30^\circ = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\), so:

\[
\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ,

\[
\tan^3 10^\circ - 3\tan^2 10^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan 10^\circ + 1 = 0.

Using the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of its exterior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we need to understand a fundamental property of polygons: the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always \(360^\circ\).

Given:
\[
\text{Sum of exterior angles} = 1070^\circ
\]

However, this seems incorrect because the sum of exterior angles should always be \(360^\circ\). Let's re-evaluate the problem statement. It might be a misinterpretation or a different context. Let's consider the sum of interior angles instead.

The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

Given:
\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = 1070^\circ
\]

We set up the equation:
\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To solve for \(n\), we first divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
n-2 = 5.944444444444444

"Given the conditions \(0 < t < 23\) and \(t+2 \equiv t^{-1} \pmod{23}\), we need to find an odd positive integer \(t\) that satisfies this congruence. Let's start by rewriting the congruence:

\[t+2 \equiv t^{-1} \pmod{23}.\]

This can be rearranged to:

\[t+2 - t^{-1} \equiv 0 \pmod{23},\]
\[t+2 \equiv t^{-1} \pmod{23}.\]

Multiplying both sides by \(t\) (assuming \(t \neq 0\)), we get:

\[t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}.\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain a standard quadratic congruence:

\[t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}.\]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \(t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 2\), and \(c = -1\). Plugging in these values, we get:

\[t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}.\]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \(\sqrt{2} \pmod{23}\). We need to find an integer \(x\) such that \(x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}\). We can test values of \(x\) from 1 to 11 (since \(x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23}\)):

\]

From the above, we see that \(5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}\), so \(\sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23}\) or \(\sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}\). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[t = -1 + 5 = 4,\]
\[t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23}.\]

Since we are looking for an odd positive integer, we have \(t = 17\). We can verify this solution by checking the original congruence:

\[t+2 = 17+2 = 19,\]
\[t^{-1} \equiv 17^{-1} \pmod{23}.\]

We need to find the modular inverse of 17 modulo 23. Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, we find:

\[23 = 1 \cdot 17 + 6,\]
\[17 = 2 \cdot 6 + 5,\]
\[6 = 1 \cdot 5 + 1,\]
\[5 = 5 \cdot 1 + 0.\]

Reversing the steps, we get:

\[1 = 6 - 1 \cdot 5,\]
\[1 = 6 - 1 \cdot (17 - 2 \cdot 6) = 3 \cdot 6 - 1 \cdot 17,\]
\[1 = 3 \cdot (23 - 17) - 1 \cdot 17 = 3 \cdot 23 - 4 \cdot 17.\]

Thus, \(-4 \cdot 17 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}\), so \(17^{-1} \equiv -4 \equiv 19 \pmod{23}\). Therefore, \(t = 17\) satisfies the original congruence.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula for the distance between a point and a line in 3D space. Specifically, if we have a point \(\mathbf{a}\) on the first line and a point \(\mathbf{b}\) on the second line, and \(\mathbf{d}\) is the direction vector of the lines, the distance \(D\) is given by

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|}.
\]

Here, we can choose \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{d} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 + 5 \\ -10 + 3 \\ 1 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-2) - (-5)(-9)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-2) - (-5)(2)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-9) - (-7)(2)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d} = \mathbf{i}(14 - 45) - \mathbf{j}(-16 + 10) + \mathbf{k}(-72 + 14) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(D\):

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{d}\|}{\|\mathbf{d}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates inside the square with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to identify the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that lie within the square.

The square is symmetric about both the \(x\)-axis and the \(y\)-axis. The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices range from \(-5\) to \(5\), and the \(y\)-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\). However, we are interested in the points strictly inside the square, so we exclude the boundary points.

For the \(x\)-coordinates, the possible integer values are \(-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4\). This gives us 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

For the \(y\)-coordinates, the possible integer values are \(-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3\). This gives us 7 possible integer values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the square, we multiply the number of possible \(x\)-values by the number of possible \(y\)-values:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

"To determine the total value of the stamps from the 1970s in units of cents, we need to multiply the number of stamps in each country during the 1970s by the value of each stamp for that country and then sum these values.

- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

The value of each stamp for the 1970s is 5 cents. Therefore, we calculate the total value for each country as follows:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times h
\]

We also know that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This means that \(\angle BAC = \angle CAD\). Since \(\overline{AD} \parallel BC\), \(\angle BAC = \angle ACB\) (alternate interior angles). Therefore, \(\angle CAD = \angle ACB\), and \(\triangle ABC\) is isosceles with \(AC = AB\).

Let's denote the length of \(AC\) as \(x\). Then the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times h
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times x
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times x = \frac{1}{2} \times x \times (h + b)
\]

We already know that \((a + b) \times h = 84\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the triangles \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) have the same height \(h\) and their bases \(CD\) and \(BC\) add up to \(a + b\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[

This simplifies to:

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[

The points \(A\) and \(C\) are points on the circumference of the larger and smaller circles, respectively, such that \(A\) and \(C\) are on the same horizontal line with \(D\) being the center.

First, we calculate the area of the smaller circle and the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle is:
\[
4\pi - \pi = 3\pi
\]

We are given that the area of the shaded region (the region inside the larger circle but outside the smaller circle) is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the smaller circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times \pi = \frac{5\pi}{12}

The area of the shaded region can also be expressed as the area of the sector of the larger circle minus the area of the sector of the smaller circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the larger circle is:

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}

The area of the shaded region is the difference between these two areas:
\[
2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}
\]

We set this equal to the given area of the shaded region:

To solve for \(\theta\), we multiply both sides by \(\frac{2}{3}\):

For our conical frustum, \( h = 8 \) cm, \( R_1 = 3 \) cm, and \( R_2 = 0 \) cm (since it's a cone with a pointy top). However, since it's a frustum, we need to consider the height of the original cone before it was cut off. The slant height of the original cone can be found using the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ \text{Slant height} = \sqrt{8^2 + 3^2} = \sqrt{64 + 9} = \sqrt{73} \]
The radius of the base of the original cone is 3 cm, and the height is 8 cm. The volume of the original cone is:
\[ V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi (3)^2 (8) = \frac{1}{3} \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 24 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]
Since the conical frustum is the original cone minus a smaller cone with height 0 cm, the volume of the conical frustum is the same as the volume of the original cone:
\[ V_{\text{frustum}} = 24 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For our sphere, \( r = 6 \) cm. Therefore, the volume of the sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288 \pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we find the number of conical frustums that can be filled with the sphere by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the conical frustum:
\[ \text{Number of frustums} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{frustum}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{24 \pi} = 12 \]

Therefore, the number of conical frustums that can be filled with the sphere is:

"Let's denote \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find the value of \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Multiplying these two expressions together, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so it simplifies to:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

We know that \(\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\) and \(\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2})^2 - (\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100. So we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

"To determine the speed of the train in meters per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the speed from kilometers per minute to meters per minute:**
   - We know that 1 kilometer (km) is equal to 1000 meters (m).
   - Therefore, 20 kilometers per minute is:
     \[
     20 \text{ km/min} \times 1000 \text{ m/km} = 20000 \text{ m/min}
     \]

2. **Convert the speed from meters per minute to meters per second:**
   - We know that 1 minute (min) is equal to 60 seconds (sec).
   - Therefore, 20000 meters per minute is:
     \[
     20000 \text{ m/min} \div 60 \text{ sec/min} = \frac{20000}{60} \text{ m/sec}
     \]

3. **Simplify the fraction:**
   - To simplify \(\frac{20000}{60}\), we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 20000 and 60 is 20.
   - Dividing both by 20:
     \[

"To determine the number of ways to form a subset of 5 elements from a set of 14 elements (8 rice plates and 6 donuts), we use the concept of combinations. The number of ways to choose \( k \) elements from a set of \( n \) elements is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \), which is calculated as:

\[
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
\]

In this problem, \( n = 14 \) and \( k = 5 \). Therefore, we need to calculate \( \binom{14}{5} \):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!}
\]

We can simplify this by canceling out the \( 9! \) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10 \times 9!}{5! \times 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5!}
\]

Next, we calculate \( 5! \):

\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

Now, we substitute \( 5! \) back into the equation:

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{120}
\]

We can simplify the numerator step by step:

\[
14 \times 13 = 182

\[
182 \times 12 = 2184
\]
\[
2184 \times 11 = 24024

Now, we divide the result by 120:

\[
\frac{240240}{120} = 2002

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subset of 5 elements from a set of 14 elements is:

"Given three distinct positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that their product is 120 and their average is 24, we need to find the smallest and largest of these integers.

First, we express the average condition mathematically:

Multiplying both sides by 3, we get:
\[

We also know that:

We need to find three distinct positive integers that satisfy both equations. Let's start by considering the factorization of 120:
\[
120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5

We will test different combinations of factors to see if they satisfy both equations.

1. **Testing \(a = 2\):**

   The discriminant of this quadratic equation is:
   \[
   70^2 - 4 \times 60 = 4900 - 240 = 4660

   Since 4601 is not a perfect square, there are no integer solutions for \(b\) and \(c\).

3. **Testing \(a = 4\):**

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and \( AM = 11 \) is the altitude, we know that \( M \) is the midpoint of \( BC \). Let \( BM = MC = x \). Therefore, \( BC = 2x \).

Since \( AD = 10 \) and \( AM = 11 \), we have \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \).

We are also given that \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \). Let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

In \( \triangle BDM \), \( \angle BDM = 90^\circ \) because \( AM \) is the altitude. Using the tangent function in \( \triangle BDM \), we have:
\[
\tan \angle BDM = \frac{BM}{DM} = \frac{x}{1} = x
\]

In \( \triangle BDC \), we use the tangent function again:
\[
\tan \angle BDC = \tan 3\theta

We know the triple angle formula for tangent:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3\tan \theta - \tan^3 \theta}{1 - 3\tan^2 \theta}
\]

Since \( \angle BDM = \theta \), we have \( \tan \theta = x \). Substituting \( x \) into the triple angle formula, we get:
\[
\tan 3\theta = \frac{3x - x^3}{1 - 3x^2}
\]

Equating the two expressions for \( \tan 3\theta \), we have:
\[
x = \frac{3x - x^3}{1 - 3x^2}

Cross-multiplying to clear the fraction, we get:
\[
x(1 - 3x^2) = 3x - x^3

Expanding and simplifying, we have:
\[
x - 3x^3 = 3x - x^3

Subtracting \( x \) and \( -x^3 \) from both sides, we get:

Rearranging terms, we get:

The solutions to this equation are \( x = 0 \) or \( x^2 + 1 = 0 \). Since \( x^2 + 1 = 0 \) has no real solutions, we have \( x = 0 \). However, \( x = 0 \) is not possible because \( BC = 2x \) and \( BC \) cannot be zero. Therefore, we must re-equality \( x = 0.

"Given that the sum of all positive divisors of a number \( n \) is \( 3^7 \), we need to determine the median of these divisors. Let's start by expressing \( n \) in its prime factorized form. Since \( 3^7 \) is a power of 3, the only prime factor of \( n \) can be 3. Therefore, we can write \( n \) as \( 3^k \) for some integer \( k \).

The sum of the divisors of \( 3^k \) is given by the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[
1 + 3 + 3^2 + \cdots + 3^k = \frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{3 - 1} = \frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2}
\]
We know this sum is equal to \( 3^7 \), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3^{k+1} - 1}{2} = 3^7
\]
Multiplying both sides by 2, we get:
\[
3^{k+1} - 1 = 2 \cdot 3^7
\]
Adding 1 to both sides, we get:
\[
3^{k+1} = 2 \cdot 3^7 + 1 = 3^7 \cdot 2 + 1 = 3^7 \cdot (2 + \frac{1}{3^7}) = 3^7 \cdot 2 + 1 = 2187 \cdot 2 + 1 = 4374 + 1 = 4375

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two parts and solve each part separately.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to factor the quadratic expression \(y^2 + 4y - 21\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-21\) and add up to \(4\). These numbers are \(7\) and \(-3\). Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:
\[(y + 7)(y - 3) < 0.\]
To solve the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\), we determine the roots of the equation \((y + 7)(y - 3) = 0\), which are \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -7)\), \((-7, 3)\), and \((3, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval in the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\).

1. For \(y \in (-\infty, -7)\), choose \(y = -8\):
   \[(-8 + 7)(-8 - 3) = (-1)(-11) = 11 > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(y \in (-7, 3)\), choose \(y = 0\):
   \[(0 + 7)(0 - 3) = (7)(-3) = -21 < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
   \[(4 + 7)(4 - 3) = (11)(1) = 11 > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \((y + 7)(y - 3) < 0\) is \(-7 < y < 3\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have:
\[-7 < x^2 < 3.\]
Since \(x^2\) is always non-negative, the inequality \(-7 < x^2\) is always true. Thus, we only need to consider the inequality \(x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]
Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[\boxed{(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})}.\]","[Interval.open(-sqrt(3), sqrt(3)), '(-\\sqrt{3}, \\sqrt{3})']","(-\sqrt{3}, \sqrt{3})",[],True
"Given the system of equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]

We also know from the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this equation, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx))\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
1. \(-8 = s(s^2 - 3p)\),
2. \(24 = sp\).

From the second equation, we can solve for \(p\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]
Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine which grade has the greatest difference between the percentage of students who passed the math test and the percentage of students who passed the science test, we need to calculate the difference for each grade and then compare these differences.

Let's start with the calculations:

1. **9th Grade:**
   - Percentage of students who passed math: \(41.1\%\)
   - Percentage of students who passed science: \(39.4\%\)
   - Difference: \(41.1\% - 39.4\% = 1.7\%\)

2. **10th Grade:**
   - Percentage of students who passed math: \(34.4\%\)
   - Percentage of students who passed science: \(33.1\%\)
   - Difference: \(34.4\% - 33.1\% = 1.3\%\)

3. **11th Grade:**
   - Percentage of students who passed math: \(20.6\%\)
   - Percentage of students who passed science: \(13.8\%\)
   - Difference: \(20.6\% - 13.8\% = 6.8\%\)

4. **12th Grade:**
   - Percentage of students who passed math: \(11.6\%\)
   - Percentage of students who passed science: \(8.6\%\)
   - Difference: \(11.6\% - 8.6\% = 3.0\%\)

Now, we compare the differences:
- 9th Grade: \(1.7\%\)
- 10th Grade: \(1.3\%\)
- 11th Grade: \(6.8\%\)
- 12th Grade: \(3.0\%\)

The greatest difference is \(6.8\%\), which occurs in the 11th grade.

Therefore, the grade with the greatest difference between the percentage of students who passed the math test and the percentage of students who passed the science test is \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",12,"[12, '12']",False
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) will be equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the intervals where the expression \(\frac{|(x - 9)(x + 9)|}{x(x - 36)}\) is negative. We will consider the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\) and test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these points: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative and \((x + 9)\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \((x - 9)\) is negative and \((x + 9)\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \((x - 9)\) and \((x + 9)\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[\boxed{(-9, 0) \cup (9, 36)}.\]","[Union(Interval.open(-9, 0), Interval.open(9, 36)), '(-9, 0) \\cup (9, 36)']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"To determine the area of the square that can fit into the path, we need to analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Understand the Path Structure:**
   - The path is a square with a side length of 400 meters.
   - The path has four quarter-circles at each corner of the square.
   - Each quarter-circle has a radius equal to half the side length of the square.

2. **Calculate the Radius of the Quarter-Circles:**
   \[
   \text{Radius} = \frac{\text{Side length of the square}}{2} = \frac{400}{2} = 200 \text{ meters}
   \]

3. **Determine the effective side length of the square that can fit into the path:**
   - The path reduces the effective side length of the square by the radius of the quarter-circles on each side.
   - Therefore, the effective side length is:
     \[
     \text{Effective side length} = 400 - 2 \times 200 = 400 - 400 = 0 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Correct the effective side length calculation:**
   - The path reduces the effective side length of the square by the radius of the quarter-circles on each side.
   - Therefore, the effective side length is:
     \[
     \text{Effective side length} = 400 - 2 \times 200 = 400 - 400 = 0 \text{ meters}

"Given that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin R = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}\). This means that the side opposite \(\angle R\) (which is \(ST\)) is 2 units and the hypotenuse (which is \(RT\)) is 5 units.

We need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root (since \(RS\) is a length):
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin T\). By definition, \(\sin T = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}\).

Therefore, the value of \(\sin T\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from a point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) to the origin, we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from a point \((x, y)\) on the curve to the origin. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Given that the distance is in the form \( \frac{\sqrt{a}}{b} \), we identify \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

The final answer is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + 2 = 5 \]

Thus, the final answer is:

"Given a regular octahedron with vertices \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) and a point \(P\) inside it such that the distances from \(P\) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, 11, and an unknown distance \(x\), we need to determine the value of \(x\).

First, recall that a regular octahedron can be inscribed in a cube. Let the side length of the cube be \(s\). The vertices of the octahedron are at the midpoints of the faces of the cube. Without loss of generality, we can place the cube in a coordinate system with vertices at \((\pm s/2, \pm s/2, \pm s/2)\). The vertices of the octahedron are then \((\pm s/2, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm s/2, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm s/2)\).

The sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant and equal to \(4s^2\). This is a known geometric property of regular octahedra. Therefore, we have:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 4s^2
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + x^2 = 4s^2
\]
Adding these values together, we have:
\[

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is the same regardless of the point. We can choose a point \(P\) such that the distances are symmetric and use the known distances to find \(s\).

If we consider the point \(P\) at the center of the octahedron, the distances to the vertices are all equal to \(s/\sqrt{2}\). However, since the distances given are not equal, \(P\) is not at the center. Instead, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances is constant to find \(x\).

By symmetry and the properties of the octahedron, we can assume that the distances are distributed such that the sum of the squares is equal. Therefore, we can solve for \(x\) by equating the sum of the squares to \(4s^2\).

Since the sum of the squares of the distances is constant, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is the same regardless of the point. Therefore, we can solve for \(x\) by equating the sum of the squares to \(4s^2\).

By solving the equation \(325 + x^2 = 4s^2\), we find that \(x = 10\).

"To determine the ratio of the weight of the索�്റ്ബോ勒 to the weight of the baseusbold, we start by noting the given weights:

- The weight of the索�്റ്ബോ勒 is 200 grams.
- The weight of the baseusbold is 150 grams.

The ratio of the weight of the索of്റ്ബോ勒 to the weight of the baseusbold is calculated by dividing the weight of the索of്റ്ബോ勒 by the weight of the baseusbold:

\[
\text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Weight of索of്റ്ബോ勒}}{\text{Weight of baseusbold}} = \frac{200}{150}
\]

To simplify this fraction, we find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 200 and 150. The GCD of 200 and 150 is 50. We divide both the numerator and the denominator by their GCD:

\[
\frac{200 \div 50}{150 \div 50} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, the ratio of the weight of the索of്റ്ബോ勒 to the weight of the baseusbold is \(\frac{4}{3}\). In decimal form, this is approximately 1.3333, but in fraction form, the answer is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Next, we need to determine the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \). According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\). Therefore, we need to find the coefficient of \( x^3 \) in \( g(x) \).

First, we expand \( (x-1)^4 \) and \( (x-1)^2 \):

\[ (x-1)^4 = x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1, \]
\[ (x-1)^2 = x^2 - 2x + 1. \]

Now, substitute these expansions into \( g(x) \):

\[ g(x) = 3(x^4 - 4x^3 + 6x^2 - 4x + 1) + 5(x^2 - 2x + 1) - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

Distribute the constants:

\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 18x^2 - 12x + 3 + 5x^2 - 10x + 5 - 9x + 9 - 2. \]

Combine like terms:

\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + (18x^2 + 5x^2) + (-12x - 10x - 9x) + (3 + 5 + 9 - 2). \]
\[ g(x) = 3x^4 - 12x^3 + 23x^2 - 31x + 15. \]

The coefficient of \( x^3 \) is \(-12\), and the leading coefficient is \(3\). Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:

\[ -\frac{-12}{3} = 4. \]

Thus, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",-2,"[-2, '-2']",False
"To find the minimum distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point is \((6, 0)\), so \(x_1 = 6\) and \(y_1 = 0\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we get:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} = \frac{|12 - 0 - 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

"Given the polynomial \( P(x) = x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 \), we know that the roots are \( \alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4 \). We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\).

First, we use Vieta's formulas, which tell us the following about the roots of the polynomial:
\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2.
\]

We are interested in the expression \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 \). Let's denote this expression by \( S_1 \), \( \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 \) by \( S_2 \), and \( \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 \) by \( S_3 \). From Vieta's formulas, we know:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

Next, we consider the product \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \). We can express \( S_1 S_2 S_3 \) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]
Expanding this product, we get:
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2.
\]
This can be rewritten using the fact that \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2 \):
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (-2)^2 = 4.
\]

Now we have the system of equations:
\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0,
\]
\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4.
\]
Since \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \) are the roots of the polynomial \( t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1)t - S_1S_2S_3 = 0 \), and we know \( S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0 \) and \( S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4 \), the polynomial simplifies to:
\[
t^3 + (S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1)t - 4 = 0.
\]
We need to find \( S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1 \). Using the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time, we have:
\[
S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Expanding this, we get:
\[
S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 + 2\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4.
\]
Substituting \( \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -2 \), we get:
\[
S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1 = \alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 - 4.
\]
We know from the identity \( (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = \alpha_1^4 + \alpha_2^4 + \alpha_3^4 + \alpha_4^4 + 2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) \), and since \( \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0 \), we have:
\[
0 = \alpha_1^4 + \alpha_2^4 + \alpha_3^4 + \alpha_4^4 + 2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2).
\]
Thus,
\[
\alpha_1^4 + \alpha_2^4 + \alpha_3^4 + \alpha_4^4 = -2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2).
\]
We also know from Vieta's formulas that:
\[
\alpha_1^4 + \alpha_2^4 + \alpha_3^4 + \alpha_4^4 = (\alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2)^2 - 2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2).
\]
Since \( \alpha_1^2 + \alpha_2^2 + \alpha_3^2 + \alpha_4^2 = (\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4)^2 - 2(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4) = 4 \), we have:
\[
\alpha_1^4 + \alpha_2^4 + \alpha_3^4 + \alpha_4^4 = 16 - 2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2).
\]
Equating the two expressions for \( \alpha_1^4 + \alpha_2^4 + \alpha_3^4 + \alpha_4^4 \), we get:
\[
-2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) = 16 - 2(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2).
\]
Thus,
\[
\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = 8.
\]
Therefore,
\[
S_1S_2 + S_2S_3 + S_3S_1 = 8 - 4 = 4.
\]
The polynomial \( t^3 + 4t - 4 = 0 \) has roots \( S_1, S_2, S_3 \). By inspection, we see that \( t = 2 \) is a root. Dividing \( t^3 + 4t - 4 \) by \( t - 2 \), we get:
\[
t^3 + 4t - 4 = (t - 2)(t^2 + 2t + 2).
\]
The roots of \( t^2 + 2t + 2 = 0 \) are \( t = -1 \pm i \). Therefore, the roots of the polynomial are \( 2, -1 + i, -1 - i \).

Thus, the set is:
\[

We can write these statements as equations:
\[ 3p + n = 1.24 \]
\[ 2p + n = 1.82 \]

To find the value of \( p \), we can subtract the second equation from the first equation:
\[ (3p + n) - (2p + n) = 1.24 - 1.82 \]
\[ 3p + n - 2p - n = -0.58 \]

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Set up the division**: We need to divide 137 by 500. Since 137 is less than 500, we will add decimal places to 137 by appending zeros. This gives us 137.000.

2. **Perform the division**:
   - **First digit after the decimal point**: how many times does 500 go into 1370? It goes 2 times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). Write down 2 and subtract 1000 from 1370. This gives us a remainder of 370.
   - **Second digit after the decimal point**: how many times does 500 go into 3700? It goes 7 times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). Write down 7 and subtract 3500 from 3700. This gives us a remainder of 200.
   - **Third digit after the decimal point**: how many times does 500 go into 2000? It goes 4 times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). Write down 4 and subtract 2000 from 2000. This gives us a remainder of 0.

Since the remainder is now 0, the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is 0.274.

The digit in the tenths place is 2, the digit in the hundredths place is 7, and the digit in the thousandths place is 4. The digit in the ten-thousandths place is 0.

Thus, the digit in the ten-thousandths place is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",4,"[4, '4']",False
"Given a square \(ABCD\) with center \(O\), and the ratio \(AB/AD = k\), we need to determine the number of points on the plane that are equidistant from \(O\) and satisfy the condition that they do not lie on the diagonals of the square.

First, note that since \(ABCD\) is a square, \(AB = AD\). Therefore, the given ratio \(AB/AD = k\) implies \(k = 1\). This means that \(AB = AD\), confirming that \(ABCD\) is indeed a square.

The set of points equidistant from \(O\) forms a circle with center \(O\) and radius \(r\). The diagonals of the square intersect at \(O\) and are perpendicular bisectors of each other. The diagonals divide the square into four right triangles, and the circle will intersect each side of the square at two points, except at the vertices where the circle will intersect the diagonals.

Since the circle is symmetric with respect to both the horizontal and vertical axes (which are the diagonals of the square), it will intersect each side of the square at two points, and it will intersect the diagonals at four points (one at each vertex of the square).

Therefore, the circle will intersect the plane at \(4 \times 2 = 8\) points in total, but since the points of intersection with the diagonals are not included, we subtract these 4 points. This leaves us with \(8 - 4 = 4\) points.

Thus, the number of points on the plane that are equidistant from \(O\) and do not lie on the diagonals of the square is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the remainder when \(54\) is divided by \(6\), we can use the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that:

\[a = bq + r\]

where \(0 \leq r < b\).

In this problem, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:

\[54 = 6q + r\]

and \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of \(54\) by \(6\):

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is \(9\). Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
\[r = 54 - 54\]
\[r = 0\]

So, the remainder when \(54\) is divided by \(6\) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to evaluate the function \( f(n) \) for each given value of \( n \) and then sum the results. The function \( f(n) \) is defined as follows:
\[ f(n) = \left\{
\begin{array}{cl}
\lfloor n \rfloor & \text{ if }n \geq 4, \\
\lceil n \rceil & \text{ if } n < 4.
\end{array}
\right. \]

Let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
1. Calculate \( \frac{\pi}{3} \):
   \[ \frac{\pi}{3} \approx \frac{3.14159}{3} \approx 1.0472. \]
2. Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the ceiling function:
   \[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.0472 \rceil = 2. \]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
1. Calculate \( \sqrt{45} \):
   \[ \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708. \]
2. Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the floor function:
   \[ f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
1. Calculate \( 8^{2/3} \):
   \[ 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^{3 \cdot \frac{2}{3}} = 2^2 = 4. \]
2. Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the floor function:
   \[ f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4. \]

Now, we sum the results:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money, in dollars and cents, the four friends have left after buying ice cream cones, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money the friends have initially.
2. Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.
3. Subtract the total cost of the ice cream cones from the total amount of money the friends have initially.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money the friends have initially.**

The amounts of money each friend has are:
- ലി�്ഡ: \$27.47
- ഷെറി: \$35.23
- ജൂൺ: \$37.37
- കോൺ: \$26.52

Adding these amounts together:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

First, add \(27.47\) and \(35.23\):
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

Next, add \(62.70\) and \(37.37\):
\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]

Finally, add \(100.07\) and \(26.52\):
\[
100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
\]

So, the total amount of money the friends have initially is \$126.59.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.**

Each ice cream cone costs \$3.50, and there are 4 friends. Therefore, the total cost is:
\[
4 \times 3.50 = 14.00
\]

So, the total cost of the ice cream cones is \$14.00.

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost of the ice cream cones from the total amount of money the friends have initially.**

Subtract \$14.00 from \$126.59:
\[
126.59 - 14.00 = 112.59
\]

So, the amount of money the friends have left after buying the ice cream cones is \(\boxed{112.59}\).","[112.590000000000, '112.59']",59,"[59, '59']",True
"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the total score of all the students and then divide it by the total number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 80.
2. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 90.
3. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 100.
4. Add up all the total scores to get the overall total score.
5. Divide the overall total score by the total number of students to get the average score.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total score for the students who scored 80 is:
   \[
   20 \times 80 = 1600
   \]

2. The total score for the students who scored 90 is:
   \[
   8 \times 90 = 720

3. The total score for the students who scored 100 is:
   \[
   2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

4. The overall total score is:
   \[
   1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520

5. The average score is:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given \( 3 \times 3 \) grid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's write down the equations for the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

1. **Sum of the first row:**
   \[
   (n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2n + 1 = S
   \]

2. **Sum of the second row:**
   \[
   (n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3n - 6 = S
   \]

3. **Sum of the third row:**
   \[
   2 + n + (n-1) = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2n + 1 = S
   \]

4. **Sum of the first column:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2n + 1 = S
   \]

5. **Sum of the second column:**
   \[
   3 + (2n-9) + n = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3n - 6 = S
   \]

6. **Sum of the third column:**
   \[
   (n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   2n + 1 = S
   \]

7. **Sum of the main diagonal:**
   \[
   (n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   4n - 13 = S
   \]

8. **Sum of the other diagonal:**
   \[
   (n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = S
   \]
   Simplifying this, we get:
   \[
   3n - 6 = S
   \]

From the equations above, we see that the sums of the rows and columns are consistent, but the sum of the main diagonal is different. Therefore, we set the sum of the main diagonal equal to the sum of the rows and columns:

\[
4n - 13 = 2n + 1
\]

Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
2n - 13 = 1
\]

Then, we add 13 to both sides:
\[
2n = 14
\]

Finally, we divide by 2:
\[
n = 7

1. Calculate the total number of swans Jím has.
2. Calculate the total number of swans Márta has.
3. Find the difference between the total number of swans Márta has and the total number of swans Jím has.

First, let's calculate the total number of swans Jím has. Jím has 300 swans on the fire and 400 swans on the water. Therefore, the total number of swans Jím has is:
\[ 300 + 400 = 700 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of swans Márta has. Márta has 400 swans on the fire and 300 swans on the water. Therefore, the total number of swans Márta has is:
\[ 400 + 300 = 700 \]

Now, we find the difference between the total number of swans Márta has and the total number of swans Jím has:
\[ 700 - 700 = 0 \]

So, Márta has \(\boxed{0}\) more swans than Jím.","[0, '0']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(\omega \neq 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(\omega^3 = 1\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the relations \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}
\]

Next, we simplify the numerator. Using the relation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

Now, we simplify the denominator. We expand \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3
\]
Using the relation \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute \(\omega^3\) with 1:
\[
1 + \omega^2 + \omega + \omega^3 = 1 + \omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 2 + \omega + \omega^2
\]
Again, using the relation \(\omega^2 + \omega + 1 = 0\), we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1
\]

So, the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1

Therefore, the value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"Given four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in a plane, we need to find the minimum possible distance from a point \(P\) to these four points such that \(P\) is not equal to any of \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\), and the distances from \(P\) to each of these points are all different.

To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometric configuration of the points. The minimum possible distance from \(P\) to the four points will occur when \(P\) is the Fermat point (or Torricelli point) of the triangle formed by any three of the points, and the fourth point is not on the circumcircle of the triangle.

The Fermat point of a triangle is the point that minimizes the sum of the distances to the vertices of the triangle. For an equilateral triangle, the Fermat point is the same as the centroid, circumcenter, orthocenter, and incenter. However, for a non-equilateral triangle, the Fermat point is the point where each angle formed by the point and two vertices of the triangle is \(120^\circ\).

Let's consider the case where the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) form an equilateral triangle, and point \(D\) is not on the circumcircle of the triangle. The Fermat point \(P\) of the equilateral triangle \(ABC\) is the same as the centroid, and the distance from \(P\) to each vertex of the triangle is the same. However, since \(D\) is not on the circumcircle, the distance from \(P\) to \(D\) will be different from the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices of the triangle.

The minimum possible distance from \(P\) to the four points will occur when the distances from \(P\) to \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are equal, and the distance from \(P\) to \(D\) is slightly greater than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices of the triangle. The exact minimum distance will depend on the specific configuration of the points, but the minimum possible distance from \(P\) to the four points will be greater than zero.

Therefore, the minimum possible distance from \(P\) to the four points is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",13,"[13, '13']",False
