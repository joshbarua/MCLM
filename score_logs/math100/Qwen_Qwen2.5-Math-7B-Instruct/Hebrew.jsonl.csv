"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) (which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \)) gives:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i

   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c

   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

"要简化 \(\sqrt{242}\)，我们首先找到242的质因数分解。我们从最小的质数开始，即2：

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

因此，242可以写成 \(2 \times 121\)。接下来，我们需要分解121。由于121是一个奇数，它不能被2整除。我们检查下一个最小的质数，即3。由于121的数字之和（1 + 2 + 1 = 4）不是3的倍数，121不能被3整除。我们检查下一个最小的质数，即5。由于121的末尾不是0或5，它不能被5整除。我们检查下一个最小的质数，即7。由于121除以7大约等于17.2857，它不能被7整除。我们检查下一个最小的质数，即11：

\[121 \div 11 = 11\]

因此，121可以写成 \(11 \times 11\)。因此，242的质因数分解是：

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

我们可以使用质因数分解来简化平方根：

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a circular table if 3 specific people (依尔, Рוזha, and Tomas) want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the group of 3 people as a single ""block"":** Since依尔, Рוזha, and Tomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single unit or block. This reduces the problem to arranging 6 blocks (the依尔-Rozha-Tomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 blocks around the table:** The number of ways to arrange \( n \) objects in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 blocks, so the number of ways to arrange them in a circle is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the people within the block:** Within the依尔-Rozha-Tomas block, the 3 people can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange依尔, Р兹ha, and Tomas within their block is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results:** The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table with依尔, Р兹ha, and Tomas sitting together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 blocks and the number of ways to arrange the people within the block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}

\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}

\[

Calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular hexagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we start by noting the properties of a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has six equal sides and six equal angles. When a regular hexagon is rotated around its center, it will look the same after each rotation that is a multiple of the angle formed by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides (which is 6 in this case).

The angle of rotation that brings the hexagon back to its original position is given by:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{6} = 60^\circ

This means that rotating the hexagon by 60 degrees will result in the hexagon looking exactly the same as it did before the rotation. Therefore, the minimum number of degrees the hexagon needs to be rotated to return to its original position is:

" given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\), and then determine the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

We solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]
\[
6 + x = 12
\]
\[
x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate our approach.

 instead, we consider the possibility that the given vertices are not adjacent but opposite vertices. Let's assume \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) are opposite vertices, and \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) are adjacent vertices.

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

We solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2}
\]
\[
5 + x = 13
\]
\[
x = 8
\]

We solve the second equation for \(y\):
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]
\[
3 + y = 12
\]
\[
y = 9
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). Therefore, the value of \(x + y\) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

We are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). Substituting this into the tangent formula, we get:

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (otherwise \(\sin A\) would also be zero, which is not possible for a non-zero angle in a right triangle), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"为了 find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

holds for every two-dimensional vector \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of the ratio \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express \(\|\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v}\|\) in terms of the components of \(\bold{v}\). If \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), then

The norm of \(\mathbf{v}\) is
\[
\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.

We need to find the maximum value of the function \( f(t) = \sqrt{\frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1}} \). To do this, we first find the maximum value of the function \( g(t) = \frac{4t^2 + 12t + 13}{t^2 + 1} \). We take the derivative of \( g(t) \) and set it to zero to find the critical points.
\[
g'(t) = \frac{(8t + 12)(t^2 + 1) - (4t^2 + 12t + 13)(2t)}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{8t^3 + 8t + 12t^2 + 12 - 8t^3 - 24t^2 - 26t}{(t^2 + 1)^2} = \frac{-12t^2 - 18t + 12}{(t^2 + 1)^2}.
\]
Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we get
\[
-12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0.
\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
\[
t = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{9 + 16}}{4} = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4}.
\]
This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = \frac{-8}{4} = -2 \). We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these critical points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):
\[
g\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 13}{\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 + 1} = \frac{1 + 6 + 13}{\frac{1}{4} + 1} = \frac{20}{\frac{5}{4}} = 16,

\[
g(-2) = \frac{4(-2)^2 + 12(-2) + 13}{(-2)^2 + 1} = \frac{16 - 24 + 13}{4 + 1} = \frac{5}{5} = 1,

\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

现在，我们可以合并分数：

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

回想毕达哥拉斯恒等式 \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\)。将此代入表达式中，我们得到：

\[
\frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

我们可以简化分数，通过 canceling out \(\cos x\) 分子和分母：

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

最后，我们认识到 \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\)。因此，表达式的简化形式为：

"Let's define the weight of one tricycle as \( T \), the weight of one square swan as \( S \), and the weight of one gook as \( G \).

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Four tricycles weigh the same as three square swans and one gook. This can be written as:
   \[
   4T = 3S + G
   \]
2. Two tricycles and one gook weigh the same as one square swan. This can be written as:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the weight of several tricycles in terms of the weight of one square swan. First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
4T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
4T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides:
\[
6T = 4S
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
3T = 2S
\]
Solve for \( T \) in terms of \( S \):
\[
T = \frac{2S}{3}
\]

Now, we need to find the weight of several tricycles. Let's say we want to find the weight of \( n \) tricycles. The weight of \( n \) tricycles is:
\[
nT = n \left( \frac{2S}{3} \right) = \frac{2nS}{3}
\]

We need to determine the value of \( n \) such that the weight of \( n \) tricycles is equal to the weight of one square swan. Set \( \frac{2nS}{3} \) equal to \( S \):
\[
\frac{2nS}{3} = S
\]
Divide both sides by \( S \) (assuming \( S \neq 0 \)):
\[
\frac{2n}{3} = 1
\]
Multiply both sides by 3:
\[
2n = 3
\]
Divide both sides by 2:
\[
n = \frac{3}{2}

Therefore, the weight of \( \frac{3}{2} \) tricycles is equal to the weight of one square swan. The answer is:

首先，我们展开乘积 \((3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2)\)：

\[
(3t^2+5t+a)(4t^2+bt-2) = 3t^2(4t^2+bt-2) + 5t(4t^2+bt-2) + a(4t^2+bt-2)
\]

现在，我们将 \(3t^2\)，\(5t\)，和 \(a\) 分别乘以 \(4t^2+bt-2\)：

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2

\[

\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]
\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2

\[
a \cdot bt = abt

\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a

现在，我们合并同类项：

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

我们知道这个表达式必须等于 \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\)。因此，我们可以将相应项的系数相等：

1. 对于 \(t^4\) 项：\(12 = 12\)
2. 对于 \(t^3\) 项：\(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. 对于 \(t^2\) 项：\(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. 对于 \(t\) 项：\(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. 对于常数项：\(-2a = 6\)

从常数项，我们可以解出 \(a\)：

\[

\]

接下来，我们将 \(a = -3\) 代入 \(t^3\) 项的方程：

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2

"To determine the radius of the conical tank, we need to analyze the rate at which the volume of water in the tank is changing and relate it to the rate at which the height of the water is changing.

The volume \( V \) of a cone is given by the formula:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone.

We are given that the volume of water is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, and the height of the water is increasing at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \( r \) of the base of the cone.

First, we take the derivative of the volume formula with respect to time \( t \):
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left( 2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \right) \]

We know that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Substituting these values into the derivative, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \frac{1}{3} \pi \left( 2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + r^2 \cdot 4 \right) \]

We can cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 20 = \frac{1}{3} \left( 2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + 4r^2 \right) \]

Next, we multiply both sides by 3 to clear the fraction:
\[ 60 = 2r \frac{dr}{dt} h + 4r^2 \]

Since the tank is conical, the radius \( r \) and the height \( h \) are proportional. The ratio of the radius to the height is the same as the ratio of the radius of the base of the cone to its height. Let's denote this ratio by \( k \). Therefore, we have:
\[ r = kh \]

We need to find the value of \( k \). To do this, we use the fact that the volume of a cone is proportional to the cube of its height. If we consider the volume of a cone with height \( h \) and radius \( r = kh \), we get:
\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (kh)^2 h = \frac{1}{3} \pi k^2 h^3 \]

The rate of change of the volume with respect to time is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{1}{3} \pi k^2 \cdot 3h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} = \pi k^2 h^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

We know that \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \). Substituting these values into the equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi k^2 h^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can cancel out \( \pi \) from both sides of the equation:
\[ 20 = 4k^2 h^2 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 4:
\[ 5 = k^2 h^2 \]

Since \( r = kh \), we have \( r^2 = k^2 h^2 \). Therefore:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Thus, the radius of the conical tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). Therefore, for \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a linear function with a slope of \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, for \(x < a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) if \(a < 0\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the intervals \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) (if \(a > 0\)) or \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) and \([a^3, \infty)\) (if \(a < 0\)) must cover all real numbers. This means that the lower bound of one interval must be less than or equal to the upper bound of the other interval.

**Case 1: \(a > 0\)**
We need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\). Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a > 0\), we consider the intervals \((0, 2]\) and \((2, \infty)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find:
- For \(a \in (0, 2]\), say \(a = 1\), we have \(1(1-2)(1+1) = 1(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0\), which is true.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), say \(a = 3\), we have \(3(3-2)(3+1) = 3(1)(4) = 12 > 0\), which is false.
Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds for \(0 < a \leq 2\).

**Case 2: \(a < 0\)**
We need \(a^2 + 2a \leq a^3\). Rearranging the inequality, we get:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0\]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0\]
Factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\]
The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). Since \(a < 0\), we consider the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \((-1, 0)\). Testing a point in each interval, we find:
- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1]\), say \(a = -2\), we have \((-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0\), which is false.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), say \(a = -0.5\), we have \((-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 > 0\), which is true.
Therefore, the inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\) holds for \(-1 \leq a < 0\).

Combining the results from both cases, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(a = 2\).

"为了确定 $c$ 的值，使得圆 $x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0$ 的半径为1，我们需要将方程重写为圆的标准方程形式，即 \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\)。这涉及到对 \(x\) 和 \(y\) 的项完成平方。

从给定的方程开始：
\[x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\]

首先，我们对 \(x\) 的项完成平方。\(x\) 的系数是 \(-10\)，所以我们取 \(-10\) 的一半，即 \(-5\)，然后平方得到 \(25\)。在方程中加减 \(25\)，我们得到：
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 + y^2 + 6y + c = 0\]
\[x^2 - 10x + 25 + y^2 + 6y + c = 25\]
\[(x-5)^2 + y^2 + 6y + c = 25\]

接下来，我们对 \(y\) 的项完成平方。\(y\) 的系数是 \(6\)，所以我们取 \(6\) 的一半，即 \(3\)，然后平方得到 \(9\)。在方程中加减 \(9\)，我们得到：
\[(x-5)^2 + y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 + c = 25\]
\[(x-5)^2 + y^2 + 6y + 9 + c = 34\]
\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 + c = 34\]

现在，我们通过从两边减去 \(c\) 来隔离圆的标准方程形式：
\[(x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\]

为了让圆的半径为1，方程的右边必须等于 \(1^2 = 1\)。因此，我们设置方程：
\[34 - c = 1\]

解 \(c\)，我们得到：
\[c = 34 - 1\]
\[c = 33\]

因此，$c$ 的值是 \(\boxed{33}\)。","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we need to consider the second iterate of \(f\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to find \(x\) such that:
\[
f(f(x)) = x \implies \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) is a solution. We are interested in non-trivial solutions, i.e., \(x \neq 0\). Therefore, we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Simplifying, we obtain:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^4 x^2 + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation \(-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^4 x^2 + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0\), we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we have:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + \lambda^2 (\lambda - 1)^2 + (\lambda^2 - \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
Expanding each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^3 - 3\lambda^2 + 3\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (\lambda^3 - \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda^4 + 3\lambda^3 - 3\lambda^2 + \lambda + \lambda^4 - 2\lambda^3 + \lambda^2 + \lambda^4 - \lambda^3 - \lambda^3 + \lambda^2 + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
Combining like terms, we obtain:
\[
\lambda^4 - 2\lambda^3 + 3\lambda^2 + \lambda - 1 = 0.
\]
We need to find the roots of this polynomial. By the Rational Root Theorem, the possible rational roots are \(\pm 1\). Testing \(\lambda = 1\), we get:
\[
1^4 - 2 \cdot 1^3 + 3 \cdot 1^2 + 1 - 1 = 1 - 2 + 3 + 1 - 1 = 2 \neq 0.
\]
Testing \(\lambda = -1\), we get:
\[
(-1)^4 - 2(-1)^3 + 3(-1)^2 + (-1) - 1 = 1 + 2 + 3 - 1 - 1 = 4 \neq 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda = 1\) and \(\lambda = -1\) are not roots, we need to find the roots numerically or by other methods. However, we can use the fact that the polynomial must have a root in the interval \([0,4]\) and check the behavior of the function. By numerical methods or graphing, we find that the polynomial has a root at \(\lambda = 2\).

Therefore, the value of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) is:

"To find the minimum positive angle \(\theta\) for which

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator is:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ,
\]
\[
-\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = -(\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = -\sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = -\sin 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we have \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator is:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we have \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

\[
\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 5^\circ = \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

Thus, we can use the tangent addition formula to simplify this further. Notice that:

\[
\sin 65^\circ = \cos 25^\circ,

Thus, we can rewrite the expression as:

"为了确定 \(42!\) (42 factorial) has how many trailing zeros, we need to count the number of times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
where \(\left\lfloor x \right\rfloor\) is the floor function, which gives the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\).

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

\[

"为了找到函数 \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值，其中 \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \)，我们首先分析函数及其边界。

首先，考虑函数在边界上的值。如果 \( x = 1 \)，则 \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \)。函数 \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) 的最大值为 1，当 \( y = 0 \) 时发生。同样，如果 \( x = -1 \)，则 \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \)。函数 \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) 的最大值为 0，当 \( y = 0 \) 时发生。

如果 \( y = 1 \)，则 \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)。函数 \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值为 1，当 \( x = 0 \) 时发生。同样，如果 \( y = -1 \)，则 \( f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \)。函数 \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值为 0，当 \( x = 0 \) 时发生。

接下来，我们考虑函数在内部点。为此，我们对 \( f(x, y) \) 求偏导数并将其设为零。

函数 \( f(x, y) \) 的偏导数为：
\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
\[
f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

将 \( f_x = 0 \) 和 \( f_y = 0 \)，我们得到：
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

将这两个方程相乘，我们得到：
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

这个方程表示单位圆。在单位圆上，我们可以使用 \( x = \cos \theta \) 和 \( y = \sin \theta \) 来参数化函数。将这些代入 \( f(x, y) \)，我们得到：
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\overrightarrow{u} \times \overrightarrow{v} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ u_1 & u_2 & u_3 \\ v_1 & v_2 & v_3 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(u_2 v_3 - u_3 v_2) - \mathbf{j}(u_1 v_3 - u_3 v_1) + \mathbf{k}(u_1 v_2 - u_2 v_1)
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The magnitude of a vector \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}
\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \( \phi \). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{i\cdot17\pi} = e^{i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"Given that the medians \(AD\), \(BE\), and \(CF\) of triangle \(ABC\) intersect at the centroid \(G\), and a line through \(G\) parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), we need to find the area of triangle \(  144 \).

First, recall that the centroid \(G\) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line passing through the centroid. Specifically, since \(G\) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the distance from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\). Since the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Note that triangle \(ENG\) is part of triangle \(AMN\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides \(MN\) into two equal segments. Therefore, triangle \(ENG\) is half of triangle \(AMN\). Thus, the area of triangle \(ENG\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{1}{2} \times 64 = 32.

\[a_n = a + (n-1)d\]

For the fourth term (\(a_4\)):
\[a_4 = a + 3d = 200\]

For the tenth term (\(a_{10}\)):
\[a_{10} = a + 9d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:
1. \(a + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a + 9d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[6d = 300\]
\[d = 50\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a\):
\[a + 3(50) = 200\]
\[a + 150 = 200\]
\[a = 50\]

Let's start by examining the denominator of the given fraction:
\[2^2 \cdot 5^7\]

The prime factorization of the denominator is already given, and it consists only of the prime factors 2 and 5. Therefore, the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) can be expressed as a terminating decimal.

We are asked to find the probability that the sum of the numbers chosen by pol and g'si is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

First, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes when pol and g'si each choose a number. Since there are 6 choices for each person, the total number of outcomes is:

Next, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where both numbers chosen are even. There is only one even number (2), so the number of ways both pol and g'si can choose an even number is:

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 (to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\)), and it must have an even number of 1's (to satisfy the factor of 2).

   - The first die is rolled and the remainder when divided by 4 can be 1, 2, or 3. This corresponds to the column of the chessboard.
   - The second die is rolled and the remainder when divided by 5 can be 1, 2, 3, or 4. This corresponds to the row of the chessboard.

2. **Determine the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - Since there are 3 possible remainders for the first die and 4 possible remainders for the second die, the total number of possible outcomes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

3. **Identify the favorable outcomes:**
   - A favorable outcome is one where the column and the row correspond to a square on the chessboard. Since a standard chessboard has 8 columns and 8 rows, there are \(8 \times 8 = 64\) squares on the chessboard.
   - However, the remainders only give us 3 possible columns and 4 possible rows, so the number of favorable outcomes is \(3 \times 4 = 12\).

4. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability that the die is rolled on a square of a chessboard is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. Since the number of favorable outcomes is the same as the total number of possible outcomes, the probability is \(\frac{12}{12} = 1\).

However, the problem seems to have a different interpretation. The problem states that the remainders determine the position of the die on the chessboard, but the chessboard has 64 squares. The remainders only give us 12 possible positions, so the probability should be based on the total number of squares on the chessboard.

The correct interpretation is that the remainders determine the position of the die on the chessboard, but the chessboard has 64 squares. The remainders only give us 12 possible positions, so the probability should be based on the total number of squares on the chessboard.

" first, we need to simplify the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\). Notice that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal. To do this, we perform the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605
\]

The decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\) is \(0.00021605\). This is a terminating decimal, so we can find the sum of its digits. The digits of \(0.00021605\) are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). We sum these digits:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14
\]

Thus, the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"要找到 \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) 的值，我们首先利用 \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\) 的恒等式。这使我们能够将正弦函数重写为：

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

因此，原始表达式变为：

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

我们知道 \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\)，所以 \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\)。因此，表达式简化为：

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

接下来，我们需要找到 \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\) 的值。使用恒等式 \(\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x\)，我们设 \(x = 20^\circ\)。那么：

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin (60^\circ - 20^\circ) \sin (60^\circ + 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{4} \sin (3 \cdot 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}.
\]

因此，\((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\)。将这个结果代回我们的表达式中，我们得到：

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

"To determine the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \). This plane extends infinitely in the \( x \) and \( y \) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \( c \) in the \( z \)-direction.

Therefore, the shape described by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, the answer is:

" first, we need to express \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term in the expression:

1. Expand \( (x + 5)^3 \):
\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 5^2 + 5^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]

2. Expand \( 49(x + 5)^2 \):
\[
49(x + 5)^2 = 49(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot 5 + 5^2) = 49x^2 + 490x + 1225
\]

3. Expand \( 623(x + 5) \):
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]

Now, substitute these expanded forms back into the expression for \( g(x) \):
\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) - (49x^2 + 490x + 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015

Combine like terms:
\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015
\]

Simplify the coefficients:
\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15x^2 - 49x^2) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015)

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x

The polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \) is a cubic polynomial. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d = 0 \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -34 \), \( c = 208 \), and \( d = 0 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots is:

"要解表达式 \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\)，我们首先使用恒等式 \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\)。这使我们能够将表达式重写为：

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

接下来，我们需要找到 \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\) 的值。我们使用恒等式，对于角度 \(x\)，\(2x\) 和 \(4x\)，它们的正切值满足方程：

\[
\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}.

设 \(x = 20^\circ\)，则 \(3x = 60^\circ\)，且 \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\)。将 \(x = 20^\circ\) 代入恒等式，我们得到：

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

两边同时乘以 \(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ\)，我们得到：

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ.

重新排列项，我们得到：

\[

将所有项移到一边，我们得到：

设 \(t = \tan 20^\circ\)。则方程变为：

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.

根据韦达定理，方程 \(t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0\) 的根 \(t_1, t_2, t_3\) 满足：

\[
t_1 + t_2 + t_3 = 3\sqrt{3}, \quad t_1t_2 + t_2t_3 + t_3t_1 = -3, \quad t_1t_2t_3 = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

由于 \(t_1 = \tan 20^\circ\)，\(t_2 = \tan 40^\circ\)，且 \(t_3 = \tan 80^\circ\)，我们有：

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

我们还知道 \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\)。因此，我们可以写：

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 10^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 10^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 1.

再次使用恒等式 \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\) 对于 \(x = 10^\circ\)，我们得到：

\[
\tan 30^\circ = \frac{3\tan 10^\circ - \tan^3 10^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 10^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon where the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the sum of all interior angles \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Substitute \(S\) into the equation:**
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine the range of possible values for the single angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each interior angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore:
   \[
   0 < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Set up inequalities for \(S\):**
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplify the right-hand side:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve for \(n\):**
   Divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Calculate the division:
   \[

   \]

8. **Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:**
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

9. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value is:
   \[
   n = 8

"我们需要 find an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. This means that we need to satisfy the equation:
\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
First, we expand the left side of the congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:
\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]
We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:
\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]
In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]
Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
We can test the values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)) to find the solution. Testing these values, we find:
\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
So, \( x = 5 \) is a solution to \( x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the quadratic formula, we get:
\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6
\]
Since \( t \) must be a positive integer less than 23, we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \). However, we need to check if \( t = 4 \) is odd. Since 4 is even, we need to check if there is another solution. Since we have already found that \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \), we need to check if there is another solution. Since we have already found that \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \p mod{23} \), we need to check if there is another solution. since we have already found that we need to check if there is another solution.

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of \(1\) cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the side length of the cube:**
   The volume \(V\) of a cube is given by the formula:
   \[
   V = s^3
   \]
   where \(s\) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is \(1\) cubic foot, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   s^3 = 1
   \]
   To find \(s\), we take the cube root of both sides:
   \[
   s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of one face of the cube:**
   Each face of a cube is a square. The area \(A\) of a square is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = s^2
   \]
   Substituting the side length \(s = 1\) foot into the formula, we get:
   \[
   A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot}
   \]

3. **Determine the total surface area of the cube:**
   A cube has 6 faces. Therefore, the total surface area \(A_{\text{total}}\) is:
   \[
   A_{\text{total}} = 6 \times A

   Substituting the area of one face \(A = 1\) square foot into the formula, we get:

"为了 find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate radical, we first need to identify the conjugate radical. The conjugate radical of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

Subtracting these values gives:
\[

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate radical is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:
\[

First, calculate \(2003 - 1\):
\[

Next, multiply 2002 by 2:
\[

Finally, add 1 to 4004:

"要 find the value of \( g(f(5)-1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.
\]

Next, we perform step 2. We need to subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.
\]

Now, we move to step 3. We need to evaluate \( g \) at \( x = 6 \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:
\[
g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7.

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\[
\tan^{-1} x + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

However, we know that \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = 1\). Therefore, the equation \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is a contradiction. This means there are no real values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

"To find the distance between two parallel lines, we need to determine the perpendicular distance between them. The given lines are:

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Since the lines are parallel, their direction vectors are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), confirming that the lines are parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula for the distance between a point and a line in 3D space. We can use the point \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and the point \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\) on the second line. The vector \(\mathbf{ab}\) is:

\[
\mathbf{ab} = \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}
\]

The distance \(d\) between the two lines is given by the formula:

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{d}_1\|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|}
\]

First, we calculate the cross product \(\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(7 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot -9) - \mathbf{j}(-8 \cdot -2 - 5 \cdot 2) + \mathbf{k}(-8 \cdot -9 - 7 \cdot 2)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(-14 + 45) - \mathbf{j}(16 - 10) + \mathbf{k}(72 - 14)
\]
\[
= \mathbf{i}(31) - \mathbf{j}(6) + \mathbf{k}(58)
\]
\[
= \begin{pmatrix} 31 \\ -6 \\ 58 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{d}_1\| = \sqrt{31^2 + (-6)^2 + 58^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}
\]

Then, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}
\]

Finally, we find the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{ab} \times \mathbf{d}_1\|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7

"To determine how many points with integer coordinates are inside the rectangle with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that lie within the rectangle.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(4 - (-4) + 1 = 9\) possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-4 < y < 4
\]
This means \(y\) can take any integer value from \(-3\) to \(3\), inclusive. Therefore, there are \(3 - (-3) + 1 = 7\) possible integer values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible values for \(x\) by the number of possible values for \(y\):

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we add these vectors together:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is the same as the length of \(CD\) since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the height is \(c\). So, we can write:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD \times \sin(\angle ADC)
\]
Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\angle ADC = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin(90^\circ) = 1\). Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We already know from the equation \((a + b) \times c = 84\) that:
\[
a \times c + b \times c = 84
\]
We need to find \(a \times c\). To do this, we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\). This implies that the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are in the ratio of their bases \(BC\) and \(AD\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{b}{a}
\]
The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]
So, we have:
\[
\frac{\frac{1}{2} \times b \times c}{\frac{1}{2} \times a \times c} = \frac{b}{a} \implies \frac{b \times c}{a \times c} = \frac{b}{a}
\]
This is true, confirming our ratio. The total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ABC] + [\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times (b + a) \times c = 42
\]
We already know this is true. To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we use the ratio of the areas:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \times [ABCD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \times 42
\]
From \((a + b) \times c = 84\), we have \(a + b = \frac{84}{c}\). Substituting this into the area formula, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{\frac{84}{c}} \times 42 = \frac{a \times c}{84} \times 42 = \frac{a \times c \times 42}{84} = \frac{a \times c}{2}
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one point from each segment is on the opposite side of the circle when the other two points are considered. This means that if we label the points in clockwise order as \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\), then either \(A\) and \(C\) are separated by \(B\) and \(D\) (i.e., \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) in clockwise order), or \(A\) and \(D\) are separated by \(B\) and \(C\) (i.e., \(A\), \(B\), \(D\), \(C\) in clockwise order).

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we can fix one point (say \(A\)) and arrange the remaining 3 points relative to it. This gives us \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways to arrange the remaining points. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is \(3! = 6\).

3. **Count the Favorable Arrangements**: Out of these 6 arrangements, only 2 will result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are the arrangements where the points are in the order \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(B\), \(D\), \(C\). In both of these cases, the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect.

4. **Calculate the Probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total number of arrangements}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

"Let's denote the radius of the smaller circle as \( r_1 = 1 \) and the radius of the larger circle as \( r_2 = 2 \). The area of the smaller circle is \( \pi r_1^2 = \pi \) and the area of the larger circle is \( \pi r_2^2 = 4\pi \).

The area of the region that is outside the smaller circle but inside the larger circle is given as \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of this region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

This region consists of a sector of the larger circle minus a sector of the smaller circle. Let's denote the central angle of the sectors as \( \theta \) (in radians). The area of a sector of a circle is given by \( \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi r^2 = \frac{\theta r^2}{2} \).

The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} \times 2^2 = 2\theta
\]

The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta}{2}

The area of the region that is outside the smaller circle but inside the larger circle is the difference between these two areas:
\[
2\theta - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{4\theta}{2} - \frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{3\theta}{2}

We know this area is equal to \( \frac{5\pi}{3} \), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \( \theta \), we multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
\[
\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{10\pi}{9}

To convert \( \theta \) from radians to degrees, we use the conversion factor \( \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \):

\theta = \frac{10\pi}{9} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{10 \times 180^\circ}{9} = \frac{1800^\circ}{9} = 200^\circ
\]

The angle \( \angle ADC \) is the angle that subtends the arc of the sector, which is \( 200^\circ \). However, since \( \angle ADC \) is the angle between the radii of the two circles, it is the angle that is less than \( 180^\circ \). Therefore, the angle \( \angle ADC \) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical glass and the spherical tank and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of the glass.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical glass. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical glass, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical glasses are required to fill the spherical tank. We do this by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical glass:
\[ \text{Number of glasses} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"设 \( x = \arcsin 0.4 \) 和 \( y = \arcsin 0.5 \)。那么我们需要计算 \( \sin(x + y) \cdot \sin(y - x) \)。

\[
\sin(x + y) = \sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y
\]
\[
\sin(y - x) = \sin y \cos x - \cos x \sin y
\]

因此，
\[
\sin(x + y) \cdot \sin(y - x) = (\sin x \cos y + \cos x \sin y)(\sin y \cos x - \cos x \sin y)
\]

这是一个平方差，所以：
\[
\sin(x + y) \cdot \sin(y - x) = (\sin x \cos y)^2 - (\cos x \sin y)^2
\]

由于 \( \sin x = 0.4 \) 和 \( \sin y = 0.5 \)，我们需要找到 \( \cos x \) 和 \( \cos y \)。利用毕达哥拉斯恒等式 \( \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 \)，我们得到：
\[
\cos x = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 x} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos y = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 y} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

将这些值代入表达式中，我们得到：
\[
(\sin x \cos y)^2 - (\cos x \sin y)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a subset of 5 friends from a group of 8 rationalists and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subset must include at least one member from each group, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of possible subsets and then subtracting the number of subsets that do not meet the condition (i.e., subsets that are all rationalists or all Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to choose 5 friends from the 14 friends without any restrictions. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 friends such that all are rationalists. This is given by \(\binom{8}{5}\):

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to choose 5 friends such that all are Democrats. This is given by \(\binom{6}{5}\):

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of subsets that do not meet the condition (i.e., subsets that are all rationalists or all Democrats) is the sum of the two values calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62

Finally, subtract the number of subsets that do not meet the condition from the total number of subsets to find the number of subsets that include at least one member from each group:

"为了简化表达式 \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\)，我们首先注意到 \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\)。因此，表达式变为：

\]

接下来，我们使用恒等式 \(\cos \left( \pi - x \right) = -\cos x\)。这给出 \(\cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\)。将此代入表达式，我们得到：

\[

\]

由于 \(\sin \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\)，我们有：

\[
-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) = 16 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

假设 \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \neq 0\)，我们可以两边同时除以 \(\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\)：

\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and height \( AM = 11 \), and there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \).

First, let \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Then \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \). Since \( AM \) is the height, \( \angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ \). Therefore, \( \angle BDM = 90^\circ - \theta \) and \( \angle CDM = 90^\circ - \theta \).

In \( \triangle BDC \), we apply the Law of Sines:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin \angle BDC} = \frac{BD}{\sin \angle BCD} = \frac{CD}{\sin \angle CBD}
\]
Since \( \angle BCD = \angle CBD = \frac{180^\circ - \angle BDC}{2} = \frac{180^\circ - 3\theta}{2} = 90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{CD}{\sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}\right)}
\]
Since \( \sin \left(90^\circ - \frac{3\theta}{2}\right) = \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} \), this simplifies to:
\[
\frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{BD}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} = \frac{CD}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
Thus, \( BD = CD \). Since \( D \) is on \( AM \), \( BD = CD = \sqrt{AD^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{10^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{100 + BM^2} \).

Next, we use the fact that \( BC = 2BM \). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{2BM}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{100 + BM^2}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
We also know that \( BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \). Let \( AB = AC = x \). Then \( BM = \sqrt{x^2 - 121} \).

Substituting \( BM = \sqrt{x^2 - 121} \) into the equation, we get:
\[
\frac{2\sqrt{x^2 - 121}}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{\sqrt{100 + x^2 - 121}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 21}}{\cos \frac{3\theta}{2}}
\]
We also know that \( \sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta \) and \( \cos \frac{3\theta}{2} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + \cos 3\theta}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{1 + 4\cos^3 \theta - 3\cos \theta}{2}} \). Since \( \cos \theta = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{\sqrt{x^2 - 121}}{x} \), we substitute this into the equation.

However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \) and the properties of the triangle. By the angle bisector theorem and the properties of the triangle, we can find that \( x = 11\sqrt{3} \).

Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = x + x + 2BM = 11\sqrt{3} + 11\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{(11\sqrt{3})^2 - 121} = 22\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{363 - 121} = 22\sqrt{3} + 2\sqrt{242} = 22\sqrt{3} + 2 \cdot 11\sqrt{2} = 22\sqrt{3} + 22\sqrt{2} = 22(\sqrt{3} + \sqrt{2})

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

" given that the sum of 27 consecutive positive integers is \(3^7\), we need to find the median of these integers. Let's denote the first integer in the sequence by \(a\). The sequence of integers can be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). Since there are 27 terms in the sequence, the median is the 14th term (the middle term). The 14th term is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81

Therefore, the median of the sequence is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which is always greater than \(-4\). This means that the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is satisfied for all real numbers \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which is equivalent to:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions to the two inequalities, we find that the solution to the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of two variables taken one at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine which class has the number of students who take the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not take the bus, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of non-teachers for each class and compare it to the number of teachers taking the bus.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of non-teachers for each class. Since there are 300 non-teachers in each class, we have:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 300 = 1.35 \times 300 = 405 \]

Now, we compare this value to the number of teachers taking the bus in each class:

1. For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class:
   - Number of teachers taking the bus: \(41.1\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)

   - Number of teachers taking the bus: \(34.4\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 103.2 = 301.8\)

3. For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) class:
   - Number of teachers taking the bus: \(20.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)

4. For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) class:
   - Number of teachers taking the bus: \(11.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 34.8 = 370.2\)

The smallest difference is 281.7, which corresponds to the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class. Therefore, the class with the number of students who take the bus closest to \(135\%\) of the number of students who do not take the bus is the \(9^{\text{th}}\) class.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x \leq -9\) and \(x < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x < -9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(-9 < x < 0\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(0 < x < 9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(9 < x < 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:

   Since \(x > 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 > 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

"To find the largest possible area of the rectangular field enclosed by the given path, we start by analyzing the structure of the path. The path consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends. The total length of the path is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two straight sides of the rectangle each have a length \( L \), and the two semicircles each have a radius \( \frac{W}{2} \). The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{W}{2} \) is \( 2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W \). Since we have two semicircles, the total length of the curved parts of the path is \( \pi W \).

The total length of the path is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two semicircles:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
We can solve this equation for \( L \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = 200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \cdot W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left(200 - \frac{\pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):

\[
L = 200 - \frac{200}{2}

A = 100 \cdot \frac{200}{\pi}

A = \frac{20000}{\pi}

" given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) in the right triangle \(\triangle RST\) with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\), we need to find \(\sin{T}\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle. For \(\angle R\), we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]
We are given that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\). Therefore, we can find \(ST\) as follows:
\[
ST = \sin{R} \times RT = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Next, we need to find the length of \(ST\). Since \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root (since \(RS\) is a length), we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Recall that:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT}
\]
Substituting the known values \(RS = \sqrt{21}\) and \(RT = 5\), we get:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

"Given a regular octahedron with vertices \(A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4, A_5, A_6, A_7, A_8\) and a point \(P\) such that the distances from \(P\) to the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \(P\) to the eighth vertex.

First, recall that a regular octahedron can be thought of as two pyramids with a square base joined at their bases. The vertices of the octahedron can be divided into two sets of four vertices each, such that each set forms a tetrahedron and the two sets are symmetric with respect to the center of the octahedron.

Let's denote the distances from \(P\) to the vertices as \(d_1, d_2, d_3, d_4, d_5, d_6, d_7, d_8\). Without loss of generality, assume \(d_1 = 3\), \(d_2 = 7\), \(d_3 = 8\), \(d_4 = 9\), and \(d_5 = 11\). We need to find \(d_6, d_7, d_8\).

By the symmetry of the octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to the vertices of one tetrahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to the vertices of the other tetrahedron. Therefore, we have:
\[
d_1^2 + d_2^2 + d_3^2 + d_4^2 = d_5^2 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2
\]

Substituting the given values:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 = 11^2 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2
\]

Calculating the squares:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 = 121 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2
\]

Summing the left-hand side:
\[
203 = 121 + d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2
\]

Subtracting 121 from both sides:
\[
82 = d_6^2 + d_7^2 + d_8^2

" given the formula for force, \( F = m \cdot a \), where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration, we can use this formula to find the relationship between the accelerations of the two spheres.

First, let's denote the force applied by both G'an and G'k as \( F \). The mass of the sphere G'an throws is \( m_1 = 200 \) grams, and the mass of the sphere G'k throws is \( m_2 = 150 \) grams. Let the acceleration of the sphere G'an throws be \( a_1 \) and the acceleration of the sphere G'k throws be \( a_2 \).

Using the formula for force, we can write the following equations for the two spheres:
\[ F = m_1 \cdot a_1 \]
\[ F = m_2 \cdot a_2 \]

Since the force \( F \) is the same for both spheres, we can set the two equations equal to each other:
\[ m_1 \cdot a_1 = m_2 \cdot a_2 \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:
\[ 200 \cdot a_1 = 150 \cdot a_2 \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the sphere G'an throws to the acceleration of the sphere G'k throws, we solve for \( \frac{a_1}{a_2} \):

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

Simplify the numerator:

(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4).
\]
Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:
\[
abc = (-2)(-2) - 0 = 4.
\]

Since \(a + b + c = 0\) and \(abc = 4\), the numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t - 4 = t^3 - 4\). The roots of this polynomial are:

"Let's define the cost of one eelagon as \( e \) dollars and the cost of one medugah as \( m \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. The cost of three eelagons and four medugahs is $1.24:
\[ 3e + 4m = 1.24 \]

2. The cost of five eelagons and four medugahs is $1.82:
\[ 5e + 4m = 1.82 \]

To eliminate \( m \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5e + 4m) - (3e + 4m) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 2e = 0.58 \]

Next, we solve for \( e \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ e = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ e = 0.29 \]

The cost of one eelagon is $0.29. Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we convert $0.29 to cents:

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction to its decimal form.

First, we perform the division \(137 \div 500\):

\[
137 \div 500 = 0.274
\]

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). We need to identify the last non-zero digit in this decimal expansion. By examining the digits after the decimal point, we see that the digits are \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\). The last digit in this sequence is \(4\).

"Given a rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\) and \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we need to find the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices.

First, let's place the rectangle in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((-a, b)\), \(B\) at \((a, b)\), \(C\) at \((a, -b)\), and \(D\) at \((-a, -b)\). Here, \(a = \frac{AB}{2}\) and \(b = \frac{AD}{2}\). Since \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The condition for a point \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed using the distance formula. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(A\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\), to \(B\) is \(\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\), to \(C\) is \(\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\), and to \(D\) is \(\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}\).

For \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}

Squaring both sides, we get:

\[

These inequalities describe a rhombus centered at \(O\) with vertices at \(\left(\pm \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2k}, \pm \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2}\right)\).

The area of the rhombus is:
\[
\text{Area of rhombus} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{diagonal}_1 \times \text{diagonal}_2

The diagonals of the rhombus are \(2 \times \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2k} = \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{k}\) and \(2 \times \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2} = b(k^2 + 1)\). Therefore, the area of the rhombus is:
\[

The area of the rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area of rectangle} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab = 4kb \times b = 4b^2k

这告诉我们54除以6的商是9。为了找到余数，我们使用以下关系：
\[54 = 6 \times 9 + r\]
其中 \(r\) 是余数。由于 \(6 \times 9 = 54\)，我们可以将这个值代入方程：
\[54 = 54 + r\]

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in cents, remains after linear, Shari, John, and Koni convert their coins into strarters, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money each person has in cents:**
   - linear: \( \$27.47 \)
     \[
     27.47 \text{ dollars} = 27 \times 100 + 47 = 2700 + 47 = 2747 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Shari: \( \$35.23 \)
     \[
     35.23 \text{ dollars} = 35 \times 100 + 23 = 3500 + 23 = 3523 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - John: \( \$37.37 \)
     \[
     37.37 \text{ dollars} = 37 \times 100 + 37 = 3700 + 37 = 3737 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Koni: \( \$26.52 \)
     \[
     26.52 \text{ dollars} = 26 \times 100 + 52 = 2600 + 52 = 2652 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Sum the total amount of money in cents:**
   \[
   2747 + 3523 + 3737 + 2652
   \]

   Let's add these step by step:
   \[
   2747 + 3523 = 6270
   \]
   \[
   6270 + 3737 = 10007
   \]
   \[
   10007 + 2652 = 12659
   \]

   So, the total amount of money in cents is \( 12659 \).

3. **Convert the total amount into strarters:**
   Each strarter is worth \( 10 \) cents. Therefore, we divide the total amount by \( 10 \):
   \[
   12659 \div 10 = 1265.9

   The integer part of \( 1265.9 \) is \( 1265 \), which represents the number of strarters. The decimal part \( 0.9 \) represents the remaining cents.

   0.9 \times 10 = 9 \text{ cents}

"为了 find the average (arithmetic mean) of the class's test scores, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores. We do this by multiplying the number of students who received each score by the score itself, and then adding these products together.

- The total score for the students who received a 80 is \(20 \times 80 = 1600\).
- The total score for the students who received a 90 is \(8 \times 90 = 720\).
- The total score for the students who received a 100 is \(2 \times 100 = 200\).

Adding these together gives us the total sum of all the scores:
\[1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520\]

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

The magic square becomes:

\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\

Let's check the sum of each row:
- First row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

Let's check the sum of each column:
- First column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

Let's check the sum of the diagonals:
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct.

"To determine how many more steps Martha walks than G'im, we need to calculate the distance each of them covers and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance G'im covers. G'im walks along the diagonal of the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the length and the width of the field).

The length of the field is 400 steps, and the width is 300 steps. So, the length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[
d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2}
\]
Calculating the squares, we get:
\[
d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500
\]
So, G'im covers 500 steps.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha covers. Martha walks along the length and the width of the field, so she covers:
\[
300 + 400 = 700
\]
So, Martha covers 700 steps.

Now, we need to find out how many more steps Martha walks than G'im. This is the difference between the distance Martha covers and the distance G'im covers:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we substitute \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Next, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]

We can simplify the denominator \(\omega(1 + \omega)\) using the relation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\):

\[
\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega(-\omega^2) = -\omega^3.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we have:

\[
-\omega^3 = -1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-1}{-\omega^3} = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1.

Thus, the only possible value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
