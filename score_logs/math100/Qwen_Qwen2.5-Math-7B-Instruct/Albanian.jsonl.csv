"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) counterclockwise is equivalent to multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotation of \( z' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 persons around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of circular arrangements for 8 persons:**
   For \( n \) people sitting around a circular table, the number of distinct arrangements is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 8 \), so the total number of arrangements is:
   \[
   (8-1)! = 7! = 5040
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:**
   If Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other, we can treat them as a single ""block"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 ""blocks"" (the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table. The number of ways to arrange 6 blocks in a circle is:
   \[
   (6-1)! = 5! = 120
   \]
   Within the Pierre-Rosa-Thomas block, there are 3! ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas. So, the total number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other is:
   \[
   5! \times 3! = 120 \times 6 = 720
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other:**
   This is the total number of arrangements minus the number of arrangements where Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit next to each other:
   \[
   5040 - 720 = 4320
   \]

Therefore, the number of ways to arrange 8 persons around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas do not sit next to each other is \(\boxed{5040}\).","[5040, '5040']",720,"[720, '720']",False
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[
= 10 \cdot 100 \left(-\frac{1}{8}\right)

\[
= 10 \cdot \left(-\frac{100}{8}\right)

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}

\[
(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Now, substitute these values back into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the minimal number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The angle of rotation that maps a regular pentagon onto itself can be calculated by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the pentagon. Since a pentagon has 5 sides, the angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

This means that rotating the pentagon by 72 degrees will bring it back to its original position. To verify, we can consider the positions of the vertices of the pentagon after each rotation. After one 72-degree rotation, each vertex moves to the position of the next vertex in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction. After two 72-degree rotations (which is a total of 144 degrees), each vertex moves to the position of the next next vertex, and so on. After five 72-degree rotations (which is a total of 360 degrees), each vertex returns to its original position.

Therefore, the minimal number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is the same as the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we set this equal to the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12 \implies y = 9
\]

Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\). The value of \(x + y\) is:
\[

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):

\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5. \]

"To find the logarithm base 10 of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we start by simplifying the expression inside the logarithm. Notice that:

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\]

This is a result of the factorization of the difference of cubes. Specifically, \(a^3 - b^3 = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2)\). Here, \(a = 100\) and \(b = 1\), so:

\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2) = 99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1)\]

Rearranging this, we get:

\[100^2 + 100 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\]

Now, we need to find the logarithm base 10 of this expression:

\[\log_{10}(99^2 + 99 + 1) = \log_{10}\left(\frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\right)\]

Using the properties of logarithms, specifically \(\log_{10}\left(\frac{a}{b}\right) = \log_{10}(a) - \log_{10}(b)\), we get:

\[\log_{10}\left(\frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\right) = \log_{10}(100^3 - 1) - \log_{10}(99)\]

Since \(100^3 = 1000000\), we have:

\[100^3 - 1 = 999999\]

So the expression becomes:

\[\log_{10}(999999) - \log_{10}(99)\]

Next, we approximate \(\log_{10}(999999)\) and \(\log_{10}(99)\). Since \(999999\) is very close to \(10^6\), we have:

\[\log_{10}(999999) \approx \log_{10}(10^6) = 6\]

For \(\log_{10}(99)\), we can use the fact that \(99\) is close to \(10^2\), so:

\[\log_{10}(99) \approx 2\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[\log_{10}(999999) - \log_{10}(99) \approx 6 - 2 = 4\]

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[

\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.

Thus, the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) is \(\sqrt{17}\), and the operator norm of \( A \) is

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one squig based on the given information and then find out how many squigs weigh the same as the combined weight of two trees and one goolee.

Let's denote:
- The weight of one squig as \( s \)
- The weight of one tree as \( t \)
- The weight of one goolee as \( g \)

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. Two trees and one goolee weigh the same as three squigs:
   \[
   2t + g = 3s
   \]
2. Two trees and one goolee weigh the same as one squig:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

Since both equations are equal to \( 2t + g \), we can set them equal to each other:
\[
3s = s
\]

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

The product is:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2) = 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, we perform each multiplication:
\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:
\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

This gives us the following system of equations:
1. \(12 = 12\)
2. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step.

From equation 5:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into equation 4:
\[
-10 + (-3)b = -16 \implies -10 - 3b = -16 \implies -3b = -6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is:

"To find the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the given information about the rate at which the volume of water is increasing and the rate at which the water level is rising.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder.

We are given that the volume of water is increasing at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour, so:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

We are also given that the water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour, so:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

To find the radius, we use the relationship between the rates of change of volume and height. By differentiating the volume formula with respect to time \( t \), we get:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the given values into this equation, we have:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:
\[ \boxed{\sqrt{5}} \]","[sqrt(5), '\\sqrt{5}']",\sqrt{5},[],True
"To determine the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) does not intersect any horizontal line more than once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

The function is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{if } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{if } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
The function \(f(x) = ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(f(x)\) occurs at \(x = a\):
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(f(x) = ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 2: Analyze the piece \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
The function \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) is a linear function with slope \(a\). For \(x < a\), the value of \(f(x)\) approaches \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left.

### Step 3: Determine the condition for no horizontal line to intersect the graph more than once
For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to not intersect any horizontal line more than once, the value of \(f(x)\) at \(x = a\) (which is \(a^3\)) must be greater than or equal to the value of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left (which is \(a^2 + 2a\)). This gives us the inequality:
\[ a^3 \geq a^2 + 2a. \]
Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \geq 0. \]
Factoring out \(a\), we have:
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \geq 0. \]
Further factoring the quadratic expression, we get:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0. \]
We need to determine the intervals where this inequality holds. The roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625\), which is positive.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12\), which is positive.

The inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \geq 0\) holds in the intervals \([-1, 0]\) and \([2, \infty)\). Since we are looking for the maximum value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) does not intersect any horizontal line more than once, we take the maximum value in the interval \([2, \infty)\), which is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the maximum value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) represents a circle with radius 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set \(34 - c = 1\) and solve for \( c \):
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda - 1 \geq 0 \implies \lambda \geq 1,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0,
\]
which is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2. We start by finding \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad \lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = 0\) is a fixed point of \(f(x)\), so we need to solve:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\) if it is not a fixed point. Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = -\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left(-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1}\right) = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1} = 0.
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Combining like terms, we get:
\[

\]
Solving the quadratic equation \(3\lambda^2 - 5\lambda + 1 = 0\) using the quadratic formula \(\lambda = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), we get:
\[

Since \(\lambda\) must be in the interval \([1,4]\), we check the values:
\[
\frac{5 - \sqrt{13}}{6} \approx 0.33 < 1 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6} \approx 1.33.

Therefore, the only value of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([1,4]\) is \(\lambda = \frac{5 + \sqrt{13}}{6}\).

"To solve the given expression for \(\theta\), we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately using trigonometric identities.

The numerator is:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the cosine addition formula, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\):
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\), we get \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\). Therefore, the numerator simplifies to:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
Again, we can group the terms to use the sine addition formula, \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\):
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ) = \sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
Using the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), we get \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\). Therefore, the denominator simplifies to:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
To simplify this, we can use the tangent addition formula in a different form. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]
Using the angle subtraction formulas, \(\cos(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\) and \(\sin(30^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ\), we get:
\[
\frac{\cos 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ + \sin 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 30^\circ \cos 5^\circ - \cos 30^\circ \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{1}{2} \sin 5^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \cos 5^\circ + \frac{3}{2} \sin 5^\circ}{-\frac{1}{2} \cos 5^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 5^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3} \cos 5^\circ + 3 \sin 5^\circ}{-\cos 5^\circ - \sqrt{3} \sin 5^\circ} = -3.
\]
Therefore, \(\tan \theta = -3\), and the angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this is:
\[
\theta = 180^\circ - \tan^{-1}(3).
\]
However, we need the smallest positive angle, which is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in \(42!\).

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1.

1. Calculate \(\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor\):
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 8.4 \right\rfloor = 8

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior at the boundary points and within the domain.

First, let's check the value of \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the square \([-1, 1] \times [-1, 1]\):
1. At \( (1, 0) \), \( f(1, 0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \).
2. At \( (0, 1) \), \( f(0, 1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = 1 \).
3. At \( (-1, 0) \), \( f(-1, 0) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -1 \).
4. At \( (0, -1) \), \( f(0, -1) = 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = -1 \).

Next, let's consider the function along the line \( y = x \). Substituting \( y = x \) into the function, we get:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x \le 1 \), we take the derivative and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2(1 - 2x^2)}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Evaluating \( f(x, x) \) at these points, we get:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{8^2 + (-10)^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{64 + 100 + 16} = \sqrt{180} = 6\sqrt{5}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \(z = e^{i\theta}\). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}, \]

which simplifies to:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \(z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}}\). If \(z = e^{i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \(z = e^{-i\pi/5}\), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \(z^{85} = -1\). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we need to understand the properties of the centroid \(G\) of a triangle and the relationship between the areas of the smaller triangle formed by the lines through \(G\) parallel to the sides of the original triangle and the original triangle itself.

1. **Centroid Properties**: The centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that the distance from the centroid to any side of the triangle is one-third of the distance from the opposite vertex to that side.

2. **Similar Triangles**: Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangle \(AMN\) is similar to triangle \(ABC\). The ratio of the corresponding sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the sides of the triangles. Since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \(G\) to \(BC\) is one-third of the distance from \(A\) to \(BC\). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(2:3\).

3. **Area Ratio**: The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Since the ratio of the sides of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \(2:3\), the ratio of the areas of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \((2/3)^2 = 4/9\).

4. **Area of Triangle \(AMN\)**: Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:

5. **Area of Triangle \(ENG\)**: Triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(AMN\) and shares the same centroid \(G\). The ratio of the sides of triangle \(ENG\) to triangle \(AMN\) is \(1:2\) (since \(G\) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, and \(EG\) is half of \(AG\)). Therefore, the ratio of the areas of triangle \(ENG\) to triangle \(AMN\) is \((1/2)^2 = 1/4\).

The first raft has 24 libraries.

We now have a system of linear equations:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( p \) be the number of penties.

We know two things from the problem:
1. The total number of coins is 12.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can express these two pieces of information as the following system of equations:
\[ d + p = 12 \]
\[ 10d + 5p = 75 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

Now we have a new system of equations:
\[ d + p = 12 \]
\[ 2d + p = 15 \]

Next, we eliminate \( p \) by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2d + p) - (d + p) = 15 - 12 \]
\[ 2d + p - d - p = 3 \]
\[ d = 3 \]

Now that we know \( d = 3 \), we substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( p \):
\[ 3 + p = 12 \]
\[ p = 12 - 3 \]
\[ p = 9 \]

Therefore, the number of penties Hillary has is \(\boxed{9}\).","[9, '9']",7,"[7, '7']",False
"To determine the probability that the sum of two numbers selected at random from the set of the first six prime numbers is even, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the set of the first six prime numbers.
2. Determine the total number of ways to select two numbers from this set.
3. Determine the number of ways to select two numbers such that their sum is even.
4. Calculate the probability by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of outcomes.

The first six prime numbers are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

**Step 1: Determine the total number of ways to select two numbers from this set.**

The number of ways to choose 2 numbers out of 6 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

Here, \( n = 6 \) and \( k = 2 \):

\[
\binom{6}{2} = \frac{6!}{2!(6-2)!} = \frac{6!}{2!4!} = \frac{6 \times 5 \times 4!}{2 \times 1 \times 4!} = \frac{6 \times 5}{2 \times 1} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 possible ways to select 2 numbers from the set.

**Step 2: Determine the number of ways to select two numbers such that their sum is even.**

The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In the set of the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

- The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers from 1 even number is \( \binom{1}{2} = 0 \).
- The number of ways to choose 2 odd numbers from 5 odd numbers is \( \binom{5}{2} = \frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5!}{2!3!} = \frac{5 \times 4 \times 3!}{2 \times 1 \times 3!} = \frac{5 \times 4}{2 \times 1} = 10 \).

So, there are 10 ways to select 2 numbers such that their sum is even.

**Step 3: Calculate the probability.**

The probability that the sum of the two numbers selected is even is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes:

\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{10}{15} = \frac{2}{3}
\]

Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two numbers selected is even is \(\boxed{\frac{2}{3}}\).","[2/3, '\\frac{2}{3}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To find the value of \( b \) when \( a = 4 \) for the equation \( 3x + 2y = 12 \), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation. Since \( a \) corresponds to \( x \) in the equation, we replace \( x \) with 4.
   \[
   3(4) + 2y = 12
   \]

2. Perform the multiplication on the left side of the equation.
   \[
   12 + 2y = 12

3. To isolate \( 2y \), subtract 12 from both sides of the equation.

"To find the total surface area of the region shaded in the given diagram, we need to analyze the two right triangles and the rectangle formed by the intersection of the two triangles.

First, let's identify the dimensions of the triangles and the rectangle:
- The first triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units.
- The second triangle has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 3 units and a height of 4 units.
- The rectangle formed by the intersection of the two triangles has vertices at \((0, 4)\), \((2, 4)\), \((2, 0)\), and \((0, 0)\). This rectangle has a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units.

Next, we calculate the area of each shape:
- The area of the first triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4\) square units.
- The area of the second triangle is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 4 = 6\) square units.
- The area of the rectangle is \(\text{base} \times \text{height} = 2 \times 4 = 8\) square units.

The shaded region is the area of the two triangles minus the area of the rectangle (since the rectangle is the overlapping area). Therefore, the total surface area of the shaded region is:
\[
4 + 6 - 8 = 2 \text{ square units}

Thus, the total surface area of the region shaded is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",10,"[10, '10']",False

"To determine the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Thus, the fraction becomes \(\frac{4321}{20000000}\).

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\). This gives us \(0.00021605\).

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x

In this case, let \(x = 20^\circ\). Then:

\[

- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane, measured from the positive \(x\)-axis.
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is constant for all points on the surface. This implies that the surface is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and extends infinitely in the \(r\) and \(\theta\) directions.

In Cartesian coordinates, the equation \(z = c\) represents a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane. Since cylindrical coordinates are just a different way of representing Cartesian coordinates, the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates also represents a plane parallel to the \(xy\)-plane.

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we need to find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

Substituting this into our expression for the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \), we get:

   Let \( \theta \) be the measure of the interior angle that is excluded. According to the problem, the sum of the remaining \( n-1 \) interior angles is \( 1070^\circ \). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \theta = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Substitute the sum of the interior angles formula:**
   Substitute \( S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ \) into the equation:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \theta = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Solve for \( \theta \):**
   Rearrange the equation to solve for \( \theta \):
   \[
   \theta = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

5. **Determine the range of \( \theta \):**
   Since \( \theta \) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < \theta < 180^\circ
   \]

6. **Set up inequalities:**
   Substitute \( \theta \) into the inequality:
   \[
   0^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

7. **Solve the inequalities:**
   First, solve \( 0^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ \):
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve \( (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ \):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by 180:
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \( n \) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

8. **Combine the results:**
   From the inequalities \( n \geq 8 \) and \( n \leq 8 \), we find:
   \[
   n = 8
   \]

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the unique value of \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the definition of the inverse. If \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, then:

\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This congruence can be expanded and rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Next, we rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}
\]

Simplify inside the square root:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]

Since we are working modulo 23, we need to find the square root of 8 modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We test values of \( x \) to find a solution:

\[
1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
6^2 \equiv 36 \equiv 13 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
7^2 \equiv 49 \equiv 3 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
8^2 \equiv 64 \equiv 18 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
9^2 \equiv 81 \equiv 12 \pmod{23}
\]
\[
10^2 \equiv 100 \equiv 8 \pmod{23}
\]

We find that \( 10^2 \equiv 8 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{8} \equiv 10 \pmod{23} \). Substituting \( \sqrt{8} = 10 \) back into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 10}{2}
\]

This gives us two potential solutions:

\[
t = \frac{-2 + 10}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 - 10}{2} = \frac{-12}{2} = -6
\]

Since \( t \) must satisfy \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \).

Thus, the unique value of \( t \) is:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a side length of 1 unit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the shape and properties of a cube:**
   - A cube has 6 faces.
   - Each face of a cube is a square.
   - The area of one face of a cube is the side length squared.

2. **Calculate the area of one face:**
   - Given the side length \( s = 1 \) unit.
   - The area of one face \( A_{\text{face}} \) is:
     \[
     A_{\text{face}} = s^2 = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square unit}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total surface area:**
   - Since a cube has 6 faces, the total surface area \( A_{\text{total}} \) is:
     \[
     A_{\text{total}} = 6 \times A_{\text{face}} = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square units}

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we start by identifying the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:

\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3
\]

Subtracting these values gives:

\[
25 - 3 = 22
\]

Therefore, the product of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate is \(\boxed{22}\).","[22, '22']",22,"[22, '22']",True
"To find the 2003rd term of the sequence of odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., we start by recognizing that this is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is 1 and the common difference \(d\) is 2.

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d
\]

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:
\[
a_{2003} = 1 + (2003-1) \cdot 2
\]

First, calculate \(2003 - 1\):
\[
2003 - 1 = 2002
\]

Next, multiply 2002 by 2:
\[
2002 \cdot 2 = 4004
\]

Finally, add 1 to 4004:
\[
1 + 4004 = 4005

Therefore, the 2003rd term of the sequence is:

"To find the value of \( g(f(5) - 1) \), we need to follow these steps:

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 2x - 3 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[ f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7 \]

Next, we move to step 2. We need to subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
\[ f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 \]

Now, we proceed to step 3. We need to evaluate \( g \) at \( x = 6 \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by:
\[ g(x) = x + 1 \]
So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:
\[ g(6) = 6 + 1 = 7 \]

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any \(x \neq 0\),

\[
\tan^{-1}(x) + \cot^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{\pi}{2}.
\]

This identity simplifies our original equation to:

\[
\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}.
\]

However, we know that \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 1\). Therefore, the equation \(\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{3}\) is a contradiction. This means there are no values of \(x\) that satisfy the original equation.

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\mathbf{r}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2\mathbf{d}_1\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula for the distance between a point on one line and the plane containing the other line. Specifically, if \(\mathbf{a}\) is a point on the first line and \(\mathbf{b}\) is a point on the second line, and \(\mathbf{n}\) is a normal vector to the plane containing the second line, the distance \(D\) is given by

\[
D = \frac{|\mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})|}{\|\mathbf{n}\|}.
\]

However, since the lines are parallel, we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines directly, which is

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|}.
\]

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}\):

\[
\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\):

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 2 & -9 & -2 \\ -8 & 7 & 5 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-9)(5) - (-2)(7)) - \mathbf{j}((2)(5) - (-2)(-8)) + \mathbf{k}((2)(7) - (-9)(-8)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{i}(-45 + 14) - \mathbf{j}(10 - 16) + \mathbf{k}(14 - 72) = \mathbf{i}(-31) - \mathbf{j}(-6) + \mathbf{k}(-58) = \begin{pmatrix} -31 \\ 6 \\ -58 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{d}_1\):

\[
\|\mathbf{d}_1\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(D\):

\[
D = \frac{\|\mathbf{d}_1 \times (\mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a})\|}{\|\mathbf{d}_1\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

"To determine which point does not lie within the boundaries of the rectangle with vertices at \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to check the coordinates of each point to see if they fall within the range of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the rectangle.

The x-coordinates of the rectangle range from \(-5\) to \(5\), and the y-coordinates range from \(-4\) to \(4\). Therefore, a point \((x,y)\) lies within the rectangle if and only if:
\[
-5 \leq x \leq 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 \leq y \leq 4
\]

Let's check each point:

1. For the point \((5,4)\):
   \[
   -5 \leq 5 \leq 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 \leq 4 \leq 4
   \]
   This point lies within the rectangle.

2. For the point \((-5,4)\):
   \[
   -5 \leq -5 \leq 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 \leq 4 \leq 4
   \]
   This point lies within the rectangle.

3. For the point \((-5,-4)\):
   \[
   -5 \leq -5 \leq 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 \leq -4 \leq 4
   \]
   This point lies within the rectangle.

4. For the point \((5,-4)\):
   \[
   -5 \leq 5 \leq 5 \quad \text{and} \quad -4 \leq -4 \leq 4
   \]
   This point lies within the rectangle.

Since all the points \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\) lie within the rectangle, there is no point among these that does not lie within the boundaries of the rectangle.

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

We now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To determine the average number of pullages per day for Juan's pullages in the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of pullages for each country in the 1970s.
2. Sum the total number of pullages for all countries in the 1970s.
3. Divide the total number of pullages by the number of days in the 1970s (which is 10).

From the table, we can see the number of pullages for each country in the 1970s:
- Brazil: 12
- Franca: 12
- Peru: 6
- Spanjë: 13

Next, we sum these numbers:
\[ 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \]

Now, we divide the total number of pullages by the number of days in the 1970s:
\[ \frac{43}{10} = 4.3 \]

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are similar by the Angle Bisector Theorem. This means that the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\). Let's denote the area of \(\triangle ACD\) by \(A_{ACD}\) and the area of \(\triangle ABC\) by \(A_{ABC}\). Then:
\[
A_{ABCD} = A_{ACD} + A_{ABC} = 42
\]

Using the ratio of the areas, we can express \(A_{ABC}\) in terms of \(A_{ACD}\):
\[
A_{ABC} = \frac{b}{a} A_{ACD}
\]

Substituting this into the equation for the area of the trapezoid, we get:
\[
A_{ACD} + \frac{b}{a} A_{ACD} = 42
\]
\[
A_{ACD} \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
A_{ACD} \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
A_{ACD} = 42 \cdot \frac{a}{a + b}
\]

Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle. The area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed as:
\[
A_{ACD} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot AD \cdot CD = \frac{1}{2} \cdot a \cdot c
\]

However, we do not need to use this expression to find \(A_{ACD}\) directly. Instead, we use the ratio we derived earlier. To find the specific value of \(A_{ACD}\), we need to determine the ratio \(\frac{a}{a+b}\). Since the problem does not provide specific values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. In this case, the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\), which is \(\frac{a}{b}\).

Given that the area of the trapezoid is 42, and the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is \(\frac{a}{a+b}\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\frac{a}{a+b}\) times the area of the trapezoid. Since the problem does not provide specific values for \(a\) and \(b\), we can use the fact that the ratio of the areas of similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. In this case, the ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\), which is \(\frac{a}{b}\).

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
A_{ACD} = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b} \cdot 42 = \frac{a}{a+b","[42, '42']",28,"[28, '28']",False

Next, we need to multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) do not intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem**: When four points are chosen on a circle, they can be arranged in a specific order around the circle. The segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will not intersect if and only if the points can be arranged such that the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) alternate around the circle. This means that if we label the points in order around the circle as \(A\), \(C\), \(B\), \(D\) or \(A\), \(D\), \(B\), \(C\), then the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will not intersect.

2. **Count the Total Number of Arrangements**: The total number of ways to arrange 4 points on a circle is given by the number of distinct permutations of 4 points, which is \(4!\) (4 factorial). However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[

"To solve the problem, we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\) in the given diagram where two circles with radii 1 and 2 are tangent at point \(D\). The total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

Next, we know that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. Let's denote the central angle of the smaller circle segment by \(\theta\) (in radians).

The area of the smaller circle segment is given by:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle segment} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the larger circle segment is given by:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle segment} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times (\pi - \theta) = 2(\pi - \theta)
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} + 2(\pi - \theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Now, let's solve for \(\theta\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} + 2\pi - 2\theta = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2\pi - \frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Subtract \(2\pi\) from both sides:
\[
-\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - 2\pi
\]

Convert \(2\pi\) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
2\pi = \frac{6\pi}{3}
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
-\frac{3\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3} - \frac{6\pi}{3} = -\frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by \(-\frac{2}{3}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{3} \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{9}

The angle \(\theta\) is \(\frac{2\pi}{9}\) radians. To convert this to degrees, we use the conversion factor \(\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{9} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180^\circ}{9} = \frac{360^\circ}{9} = 40^\circ

\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the given sphere, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many times the volume of the cylinder fits into the volume of the sphere. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[ \text{Number of gotas} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[

   - We know that there are 60 seconds in a minute.

   - To find the speed in inches per second, we divide the speed in inches per minute by the number of seconds in a minute:

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 Republicans and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of Republicans or only of Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Republicans. There are 8 Republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Democrats. There are 6 Democrats, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Republicans and the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of Democrats from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee:

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x)\) excluding \(x=1\). This product is given by:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{14} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}}.

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. To do this, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.

Since \(\cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = -\cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), we can write:

We are also given that there is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). Then \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \theta\).

Since \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\), we have \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\). We can use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\):

\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + MC^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot MC \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]

Substituting the known values, we get:

\[
BD^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(6\theta) = 2x^2(1 - \cos(6\theta))
\]

Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(6\theta) = 4\cos^3(2\theta) - 3\cos(2\theta)\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
BD^2 = 2x^2(1 - (4\cos^3(2\theta) - 3\cos(2\theta))) = 2x^2(1 - 4\cos^3(2\theta) + 3\cos(2\theta)) = 2x^2(4\cos^3(2\theta) - 4\cos^2(2\theta)) = 8x^2\cos^2(2\theta)(\cos(2\theta) - 1)
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABD\):

\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\angle BAD)
\]

Since \(AB = AC\) and \(\angle BAD = \theta\), we have:

\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot 10 \cdot \cos(\theta) = AB^2 + 100 - 20AB \cos(\theta)

Equating the two expressions for \(BD^2\), we get:

\[
8x^2\cos^2(2\theta)(\cos(2\theta) - 1) = AB^2 + 100 - 20AB \cos(\theta)

Using the double angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(2\theta) = 2\cos^2(\theta) - 1\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
8x^2(2\cos^2(\theta) - 1)^2(2\cos^2(\theta) - 2) = AB^2 + 100 - 20AB \cos(\theta)

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
8x^2 \cdot 4\cos^4(\theta) \cdot 2(\cos^2(\theta) - 1) = 64x^2 \cos^4(\theta)(\cos^2(\theta) - 1) = 64x^2 \cos^4(\theta)(\cos(\theta) - 1)(\cos(\theta) + 1)

Since \(AB = \sqrt{AM^2 + BM^2} = \sqrt{11^2 + x^2} = \sqrt{121 + x^2}\), we substitute this into the equation:

\[
64x^2 \cos^4(\theta)(\cos(\theta) - 1)(\cos(\theta) + 1) = 121 + x^2 - 20\sqrt{121 + x^2} \cos(\theta)

To find \(\cos(\theta)\), we use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 6\theta\) and \(\angle BAC = 2\theta\). By the properties of the triangle and the given angle relationships, we can deduce that \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}\). Substituting \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{3}{5}\) into the equation, we get:

\[
64x^2 \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^4 \left(\frac{3}{5} - 1\right)\left(\frac{3}{5} + 1\right) = 121 + x^2 - 20\sqrt{121 + x^2} \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
64x^2 \cdot \frac{81}{625} \cdot \left(-\frac{2}{5}\right) \cdot \frac{8}{5} = 64x^2 \cdot \frac{81}{625} \cdot \left(-\frac{16}{25}\right) = -64x^2 \cdot \frac{1296}{15625} = -\frac{82944x^2}{15625}
\]

Simplifying the right side, we get:

\[
121 + x^2 - 12\sqrt{121 + x^2}
\]

Equating the two sides, we get:

\[
-\frac{82944x^2}{15625} = 121 + x^2 - 12\sqrt{121 + x^2}

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\).

Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have:

\[ y < 3 \]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[ x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

### Step 3: Combine the results

From Step 1, we know that \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true. From Step 2, we have \(x^2 < 3\), which gives us \(-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,

\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

"To determine which class has a greater number of meshkujes than femra by \(135\%\) of the number of femra, we need to calculate the difference between the number of meshkujes and the number of femra for each class and compare it to \(135\%\) of the number of femra.

First, let's calculate the number of meshkujes and femra in each class:

1. **Class 9:**
   - Meshkujes: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Femra: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
   - Difference: \(123.3 - 118.2 = 5.1\)
   - \(135\%\) of femra: \(1.35 \times 118.2 = 159.07\)
   - \(5.1 < 159.07\)

2. **Class 10:**
   - Meshkujes: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Femra: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
   - Difference: \(103.2 - 99.3 = 3.9\)
   - \(135\%\) of femra: \(1.35 \times 99.3 = 134.055\)
   - \(3.9 < 134.055\)

3. **Class 11:**
   - Meshkujes: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Femra: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
   - Difference: \(61.8 - 41.4 = 20.4\)
   - \(135\%\) of femra: \(1.35 \times 41.4 = 55.65\)
   - \(20.4 < 55.65\)

4. **Class 12:**
   - Meshkujes: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
   - Femra: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
   - Difference: \(34.8 - 25.8 = 9\)
   - \(135\%\) of femra: \(1.35 \times 25.8 = 34.83\)
   - \(9 < 34.83\)

From the calculations, we see that none of the classes have a difference of meshkujes and femra that is greater than \(135\%\) of the number of femra. Therefore, there is no class where the number of meshkujes is more than \(135\%\) of the number of femra.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) is equal to \((x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x - 9)(x + 9)\) when \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\).

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to determine the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the roots of the numerator and the denominator, which are \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\), and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into five intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

We will test a point in each interval to determine the sign of the expression in that interval.

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), choose \(x = -10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-10)^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-10)^2 - 36(-10) = 100 + 360 = 460.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{460} > 0\).

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), choose \(x = -1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |(-1)^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = (-1)^2 - 36(-1) = 1 + 36 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{37} > 0\).

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), choose \(x = 1\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |1^2 - 81| = |1 - 81| = 80,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 1^2 - 36(1) = 1 - 36 = -35.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{80}{-35} < 0\).

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), choose \(x = 10\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |10^2 - 81| = |100 - 81| = 19,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 10^2 - 36(10) = 100 - 360 = -260.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{19}{-260} < 0\).

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), choose \(x = 37\):
   \[|x^2 - 81| = |37^2 - 81| = |1369 - 81| = 1288,\]
   \[x^2 - 36x = 37^2 - 36(37) = 1369 - 1332 = 37.\]
   So, \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} = \frac{1288}{37} > 0\).

From the above analysis, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((0, 9)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the area of the largest possible rectangle inscribed in a semicircle with a given perimeter, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations.

Let the radius of the semicircle be \( r \). The perimeter of the semicircle consists of the diameter and the circumference of the semicircle. Therefore, the perimeter is given by:
\[
2r + \pi r = 400
\]
We can factor out \( r \) from the left side of the equation:
\[
r(2 + \pi) = 400
\]
Solving for \( r \), we get:
\[
r = \frac{400}{2 + \pi}
\]

Next, we consider the rectangle inscribed in the semicircle. Let the width of the rectangle be \( x \) and the height be \( y \). The width \( x \) is equal to the length of the rectangle, and the height \( y \) is the vertical distance from the center of the semicircle to the top of the rectangle. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
x^2 + y^2 = r^2
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = x \cdot y
\]
We can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \) using the equation \( x^2 + y^2 = r^2 \):
\[
y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}
\]
Substituting this expression for \( y \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = x \sqrt{r^2 - x^2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( x \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dx} = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} + x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} - \frac{x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} = \frac{r^2 - x^2 - x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} = \frac{r^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}}
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{r^2 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{r^2 - x^2}} = 0
\]
This implies:
\[
r^2 - 2x^2 = 0
\]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[
x^2 = \frac{r^2}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{r}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Substituting \( x = \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2} \) back into the equation \( y = \sqrt{r^2 - x^2} \), we get:
\[
y = \sqrt{r^2 - \left(\frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{r^2 - \frac{2r^2}{4}} = \sqrt{r^2 - \frac{r^2}{2}} = \sqrt{\frac{r^2}{2}} = \frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
Therefore, the area \( A \) of the rectangle is:
\[
A = x \cdot y = \left(\frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{r\sqrt{2}}{2}\right) = \frac{2r^2}{4} = \frac{r^2}{2}
\]
Substituting \( r = \frac{400}{2 + \pi} \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \frac{\left(\frac{400}{2 + \pi}\right)^2}{2} = \frac{160000}{2(2 + \pi)^2} = \frac{80000}{(2 + \pi)^2}
\]
Thus, the area of the largest possible rectangle is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, for \(\angle R\), we have:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides (since side lengths are positive):
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of \(\angle T\) is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]

Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):

Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]

The eighth vertex \( G \) will be at \( (1, 1, 1) \) or \( (-1, -1, -1) \). We need to determine which of these coordinates corresponds to the eighth vertex.

Given the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \), we can use the distance formula:
\[
d(P, V) = \sqrt{(x_P - x_V)^2 + (y_P - y_V)^2 + (z_P - z_V)^2}
\]

Let \( P = (x_P, y_P, z_P) \). We know:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&d(P, A) = 3 \implies \sqrt{(x_P - 1)^2 + y_P^2 + z_P^2} = 3 \\
&d(P, B) = 7 \implies \sqrt{(x_P + 1)^2 + y_P^2 + z_P^2} = 7 \\
&d(P, C) = 8 \implies \sqrt{x_P^2 + (y_P - 1)^2 + z_P^2} = 8 \\
&d(P, D) = 9 \implies \sqrt{x_P^2 + (y_P + 1)^2 + z_P^2} = 9 \\
&d(P, E) = 11 \implies \sqrt{x_P^2 + y_P^2 + (z_P - 1)^2} = 11 \\
&d(P, F) = 11 \implies \sqrt{x_P^2 + y_P^2 + (z_P + 1)^2} = 11
\end{aligned}
\]

We square each equation to eliminate the square roots:
\[
\begin{aligned}
& (x_P - 1)^2 + y_P^2 + z_P^2 = 9 \\
& (x_P + 1)^2 + y_P^2 + z_P^2 = 49 \\
& x_P^2 + (y_P - 1)^2 + z_P^2 = 64 \\
& x_P^2 + (y_P + 1)^2 + z_P^2 = 81 \\
& x_P^2 + y_P^2 + (z_P - 1)^2 = 121 \\
& x_P^2 + y_P^2 + (z_P + 1)^2 = 121
\end{aligned}
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x_P + 1)^2 - (x_P - 1)^2 = 49 - 9 \implies 4x_P = 40 \implies x_P = 10
\]

This result is not possible since \( x_P \) must be within the range of the cube's side length. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate our approach.

Given the symmetry and distances, we can use the fact that the distances from \( P \) to the vertices \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) are symmetric around the center of the octahedron. The correct approach is to use the properties of the octahedron and the distances to find the correct coordinates.

Finally, we find the distance from \( P \) to \( G \) using the correct coordinates and distances. The correct distance is:

"To determine the ratio of the加 Shpejtim of topi i softballit to topi i bejugolit, we start by identifying the masses of each top. The mass of the top i softballit is 200 grams, and the mass of the top i bejugolit is 150 grams.

The ratio of the mass of the top i softballit to the mass of the top i bejugolit is given by:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ways to arrange 8 shtrigas and 10 magjistarës in a line such that no shtrigas is next to another shtrigas and no magjistarës is next to another magjistarë. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Determine the possible positions for shtrigas and magjistarës:**
   - Since no two shtrigas can be next to each other, there must be at least one magjistarë between each pair of shtrigas.
   - Similarly, no two magjistarës can be next to each other, so there must be at least one shtrigas between each pair of magjistarës.
   - This means we need to place the shtrigas and magjristës in an alternating pattern. Since there are more magjistarës than shtrigas, the pattern must start and end with a magjistarë.

2. **Arrange the magjistarës:**
   - We have 10 magjistarës, and they can be arranged in \(10!\) (10 factorial) ways.
   - \(10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 3,628,800\).

3. **Arrange the shtrigas:**
   - After placing the magjistarës, there are 11 possible positions to place the shtrigas (one before the first magjistarë, one between each pair of magjistarës, and one after the last magjistarë).
   - We need to choose 8 out of these 11 positions to place the shtrigas. The number of ways to choose 8 positions out of 11 is given by the combination formula \(\binom{11}{8}\).
   - \(\binom{11}{8} = \binom{11}{3} = \frac{11 \times 10 \times 9}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 165\).
   - Once we have chosen the positions, we can arrange the 8 shtrigas in these 8 positions in \(8!\) (8 factorial) ways.
   - \(8! = 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 40,320\).

4. **Calculate the total number of arrangements:**
   - The total number of ways to arrange the shtrigas and magjistarës is the product of the number of ways to arrange the magjistarës and the number of ways to arrange the shtrigas in the chosen positions.
   - Total number of arrangements = \(10! \times \binom{11}{8} \times 8! = 3,628,800 \times 165 \times 40,320\).

5. **Simplify the expression:**
   - First, calculate \(165 \times 40,320\):
     \[
     165 \times 40,320 = 6,652,800
     \]
   - Then, calculate \(3,628,800 \times 6,652,800\):
     \[
     3,628,800 \times 6,652,800 = 24,192,000,000

Therefore, the total number of ways to arrange the shtrigas and magjistarës in the line is \(\boxed{24192000000}\).","[24192000000, '24192000000']",60,"[60, '60']",False
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). We do this by subtracting \(2x\) from both sides:

\[
y - 2x = -2
\]

Next, we move all terms to one side to get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Now, we identify the coefficients \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\):
- \(A = -2\)
- \(B = 1\)
- \(C = 2\)

The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Substitute \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), \(x_1\), and \(y_1\) into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|-2(6) + 1(0) + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}}

Simplify the numerator:

\[
-2(6) + 1(0) + 2 = -12 + 0 + 2 = -10

So, the absolute value of the numerator is:

\[
|-10| = 10
\]

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[
d = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

\[
d = \frac{10 \sqrt{5}}{5}

Simplify the fraction:

\[
d = 2 \sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 0x^2 + 0x + 2 = 0\), Vieta's formulas give us:
1. \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2\)

Next, we consider the polynomial whose roots are \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_3\), \(\alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4\). The sum of the roots of this polynomial is:

and the product of the roots is:
\[(\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_1\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_4)(\alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^3 = 2^3 = 8.\]

The polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is a cubic polynomial with roots \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). The sum of the roots of this polynomial is \(a + b + c = 0\), and the product of the roots is \(abc\). We need to find \(abc\).

Using the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken two at a time, we have:

Substituting the known values, we get:
\[0^2 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2),\]
\[0 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 - 8,\]
\[(\alpha_1\alpha_2)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_1\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_3)^2 + (\alpha_2\alpha_4)^2 + (\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 8.\]

We also know that:
\[(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = (a + b + c)^2 = 0^2 = 0,\]
\[(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\]
\[0 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2(ab + bc + ca),\]
\[a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = -2(ab + bc + ca).\]
Since \(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 8\), we have:
\[8 = -2(ab + bc + ca),\]
\[ab + bc + ca = -4.\]

Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
\[t^3 - (a+b+c)t^2 + (ab+bc+ca)t - abc = t^3 - 0 \cdot t^2 - 4t - abc = t^3 - 4t - abc.\]

We need to find \(abc\). Using the identity for the sum of the product of the roots taken three at a time, we have:
\[(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4),\]
\[0 \cdot 0 = 2 \cdot (-2) + abc \cdot 0,\]
\[0 = -4 + 0,\]
\[abc = 4.\]

Therefore, the polynomial whose roots are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
\[t^3 - 4t - 4.\]

The roots of this polynomial are the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots \(\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4\). Testing \(t = 2\), we get:
\[2^3 - 4 \cdot 2 - 4 = 8 - 8 - 4 = -4 \neq 0.\]
Testing \(t = -2\), we get:
\[-2^3 - 4 \cdot (-2) - 4 = -8 + 8 - 4 = -4 \neq 0.\]

Testing \(t = -1\), we get:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\), \(A\) at \((-a, b)\), \(B\) at \((a, b)\), \(C\) at \((a, -b)\), and \(D\) at \((-a, -b)\). The condition that a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex can be expressed using the Euclidean distance formula. Specifically, the point \((x, y)\) must satisfy:

\[

6. \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x+a)^2 + (y+b)^2} \implies x^2 + y^2 < (x+a)^2 + (y+b)^2 \implies x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

Combining these inequalities, we find that the region where a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is a square with vertices at \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, -\frac{b}{2}\right)\), \(\left(\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\), and \(\left(-\frac{a}{2}, \frac{b}{2}\right)\). The area of this square is:

\[
\left(\frac{a}{2} - \left(-\frac{a}{2}\right)\right) \left(\frac{b}{2} - \left(-\frac{b}{2}\right)\right) = a \cdot b
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:

\[
2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:

\[
\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

Thus, the answer is:

\[

"To solve the problem \(54 \mod 6\), we need to determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6. Let's go through the steps:

1. **Perform the Division**: Divide 54 by 6.
   \[
   54 \div 6 = 9
   \]
   This tells us that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9.

2. **Identify the Quotient and Remainder**: The quotient is 9, and we need to find the remainder. The remainder is what is left after multiplying the quotient by the divisor and subtracting the result from the original number.
   \[
   54 - (9 \times 6) = 54 - 54 = 0
   \]
   So, the remainder is 0.

3. **Conclusion**: Therefore, \(54 \mod 6\) is 0.

The final answer is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} \approx 1.047 \) and \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function:
  \[
  f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil \frac{\pi}{3} \rceil = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2.
  \]

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- Since \( \sqrt{45} = \sqrt{9 \cdot 5} = 3\sqrt{5} \approx 3 \cdot 2.236 = 6.708 \) and \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function:
  \[
  f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor \sqrt{45} \rfloor = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6.
  \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \) and \( 8^{2/3} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function:
  \[
  f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 8^{2/3} \rfloor = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4.
  \]

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[
f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12.
\]

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much more money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have in total after converting their monedhat into dollars, we first need to add up the amounts they each fitoi.

Linda fitoi $27.47.
Sherry fitoi $35.23.
June fitoi $37.37.
Connie fitoi $26.52.

We add these amounts together step by step:

\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
\]

\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
\]

\[

So, the total amount of money they have in dollars is $126.59.

Next, we need to convert this total amount into carties monedha. Since 1 dollar is equal to 100 carties monedha, we multiply $126.59 by 100:

\[
126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ carties monedha}

"To find the average score of the class, we need to calculate the sum of all the scores and then divide by the total number of students. Here are the steps:

1. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 80.
2. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 90.
3. Calculate the total score for the students who scored 100.
4. Add up all the scores to get the total score for the class.
5. Divide the total score by the total number of students to get the average score.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. The total score for the students who scored 80 is:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums:
\[
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\
\hline
2 & 7 & 6 \\

\]
The sum of the first row is:
\[
4 + 3 + 8 = 15
\]
The sum of the second row is:
\[
9 + 5 + 1 = 15
\]
The sum of the third row is:
\[

\]
The sum of the first column is:
\[
4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the second column is:
\[

\]
The sum of the third column is:
\[

The sum of the main diagonal is:

The sum of the other diagonal is:

"To determine how many more centimeters Martha ecends Jim, we need to calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular field and the total distance Martha walks.

First, let's calculate the length of the diagonal of the rectangular field using the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ d = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2} \]

where \( d \) is the length of the diagonal, \( a \) is the length of one side, and \( b \) is the length of the other side. For the rectangular field, \( a = 300 \) cm and \( b = 400 \) cm. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ d = \sqrt{300^2 + 400^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{90000 + 160000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ cm} \]

So, the length of the diagonal is 500 cm. This is the distance Jim ECends.

Next, let's calculate the total distance Martha walks. Martha walks the length of the field and the width of the field, so the total distance she walks is:

\[ \text{Total distance Martha walks} = 300 \text{ cm} + 400 \text{ cm} = 700 \text{ cm} \]

Now, we need to find out how many more centimeters Martha ecends Jim. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim ECends from the total distance Martha walks:

\[ \text{Difference} = 700 \text{ cm} - 500 \text{ cm} = 200 \text{ cm} \]

Therefore, Martha ecends Jim \(\boxed{200}\) cm more.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The roots of the equation \(x^3 - 1 = 0\) are \(1, \omega, \omega^2\), where \(\omega\) and \(\omega^2\) satisfy the relations \(\omega^3 = 1\) and \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\). This implies \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\). First, we substitute \(\omega^2 = -1 - \omega\) into the expression:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + (-1 - \omega)} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{-\omega} = \frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega}.
\]

Next, we find a common denominator for the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} - \frac{1}{\omega} = \frac{\omega - (1 + \omega)}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{\omega - 1 - \omega}{\omega(1 + \omega)} = \frac{-1}{\omega(1 + \omega)}.
\]

We can simplify the denominator \(\omega(1 + \omega)\) using the relation \(1 + \omega + \omega^2 = 0\), which implies \(1 + \omega = -\omega^2\):

\[
\omega(1 + \omega) = \omega(-\omega^2) = -\omega^3.
\]

Since \(\omega^3 = 1\), we have:

\[
-\omega^3 = -1.
\]

Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{-1}{-\omega^3} = \frac{-1}{-1} = 1.
\]

Thus, the value of \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\) is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
