"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \), we get:
   \[
   z'' = z' \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Substituting \( z' = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \):
   \[
   z'' = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Substituting \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \):
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the complex number \( w \) is:

"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine how many students are in the class, let's break down the information given:

1. Mitu moodi saava 8 inimest.
2. Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas each have 3 inimest.
3. Each pair of students shares the same number ofistu.

First, let's calculate the total number of inimest for Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas:
\[ 3 + 3 + 3 = 9 \]

Since each pair of students shares the same number ofistu, we need to determine how many pairs there are. There are three students (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas), and the number of ways to choose 2 students out of 3 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{3}{2} \):
\[ \binom{3}{2} = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2 \times 1}{2 \times 1 \times 1} = 3 \]

This means there are 3 pairs of students, and each pair shares the same number ofistu. Since the total number of inimest for all three students is 9, and there are 3 pairs, the number ofistu each pair shares is:
\[ \frac{9}{3} = 3 \]

Now, we know that Mitu moodi has 8 inimest, and each pair of students shares 3 inimest. Since Mitu moodi is not part of any pair with Pierre, Rosa, or Thomas, she must have all her inimest to herself. Therefore, the total number of students in the class is the sum of Mitu moodi and the three students (Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas):
\[ 1 + 3 = 4 \]

However, this does not account for the fact that each pair shares 3 inimest. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the total number of students and the distribution of inimest.

If we assume there are \( n \) students in total, and each pair shares 3 inimest, we need to find \( n \) such that the total number of inimest is consistent with the given information.

Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the total number of students and the distribution of inimest.

"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum radius of a circle that can circumscribe a square. Let's denote the side length of the square as \( s \).

1. **Identify the relationship between the side length of the square and the diameter of the circumscribed circle:**
   The diagonal of the square is the diameter of the circumscribed circle. The diagonal of a square with side length \( s \) can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem. The diagonal \( d \) forms a right triangle with two sides of the square, so:
   \[
   d = \sqrt{s^2 + s^2} = \sqrt{2s^2} = s\sqrt{2}

   Therefore, the diameter of the circumscribed circle is \( s\sqrt{2} \).

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices as \(A = (5, 3)\), \(B = (6, 8)\), \(C = (7, 4)\), and \(D = (x, y)\). We can consider two possible pairs of diagonals: \(AC\) and \(BD\), or \(AB\) and \(CD\), or \(AD\) and \(BC\). However, since \(x > 7\), the most logical pair to consider is \(AD\) and \(BC\).

First, we find the midpoint of \(BC\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BC = \left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Next, we find the midpoint of \(AD\):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AD = \left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\) and \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we need to find \(\tan A\).

First, recall the definition of the sine and cosine functions in a right triangle:
\[
\sin A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} \quad \text{and} \quad \cos A = \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
From the given equation \(\sin A = 2\cos A\), we can substitute the definitions of sine and cosine:
\[
\frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Since the hypotenuse is the same on both sides of the equation, we can cancel it out:
\[
\text{opposite} = 2 \cdot \text{adjacent}
\]
The tangent of angle \(A\) is defined as the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side:
\[
\tan A = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To find the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\), we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to factor it.

\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + 1^2.\]

This looks like the expanded form of a binomial square, but with a slight modification. The binomial square formula is \((a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2\). If we compare \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) to \((a + b)^2\), we can see that \(a = 99\) and \(b = \frac{1}{2}\) would not work directly because \(2ab = 2 \cdot 99 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 99\), but we need \(2ab = 99\). Instead, we can use a different approach.

Let's try to factor \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) by recognizing a pattern. Notice that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = \frac{100^3 - 1}{99}.\]

This is a known algebraic identity. To verify, we can expand \(\frac{100^3 - 1}{99}\):
\[100^3 - 1 = (100 - 1)(100^2 + 100 + 1) = 99 \cdot (100^2 + 100 + 1).\]
Dividing both sides by 99, we get:
\[\frac{100^3 - 1}{99} = 100^2 + 100 + 1.\]

Therefore, \(99^2 + 99 + 1 = 100^2 + 100 + 1\). Now, we can calculate \(100^2 + 100 + 1\):
\[100^2 = 10000,\]
\[10000 + 100 = 10100,\]
\[10100 + 1 = 10101.\]

So, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{10101}\).","[10101, '10101']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False
"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\) be a unit vector, so \(\|\bold{v}\| = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 1\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y.
\]

Rearranging these equations, we obtain

\[
(8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0,
\]
\[
12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0.
\]

This system can be written in matrix form as

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\ 12 & 26 - 2\lambda \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:

\[
\det \begin{pmatrix} 8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\ 12 & 26 - 2\lambda \end{pmatrix} = (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - 12 \cdot 12 = 0.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get

\[
(8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - 144 = 208 - 16\lambda - 52\lambda + 4\lambda^2 - 144 = 4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 64 = 0.
\]

Dividing through by 4, we obtain

\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0.
\]

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get

\[
(\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16) = 0.
\]

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda = 1\) and \(\lambda = 16\). The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 16, which occurs when \(\lambda = 16\). Therefore, the operator norm of the matrix \( A \) is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10:**
   - The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
     \[
     58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   - The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
     \[
     18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}

2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10:**
   \[
   53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
   \]

3. **Convert the result back to base 9:**
   - To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to determine the coefficients of the powers of 9. We start by finding the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36.
     - \(9^2 = 81\) (which is greater than 36, so we use \(9^1\) and \(9^0\))
     - \(9^1 = 9\)
     - \(9^0 = 1\)
   - We divide 36 by 9 to find the coefficient for \(9^1\):
     \[
     36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{(so the coefficient for } 9^1 \text{ is 4)}
     \]
   - We then subtract \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\) from 36 to find the coefficient for \(9^0\):

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the value of each type of tree in terms of paljus. Let's define the value of a palu as \( p \), the value of a squig as \( s \), and the value of a goolee as \( g \).

From the problem, we have the following equations:
1. One palu and one squig is equal to one palu and one goolee:
   \[
   p + s = p + g
   \]
   Subtracting \( p \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   s = g
   \]
   So, the value of a squig is the same as the value of a goolee.

2. Two treeki and one squig is equal to one palu and three squigs:
   \[
   2t + s = p + 3s
   \]
   Subtracting \( s \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   2t = p + 2s
   \]
   Since \( s = g \), we can substitute \( g \) for \( s \):
   \[
   2t = p + 2g
   \]

3. One treeki and one goolee is equal to one palu and one squig:
   \[
   t + g = p + s
   \]
   Since \( s = g \), we can substitute \( g \) for \( s \):
   \[
   t + g = p + g
   \]
   Subtracting \( g \) from both sides, we get:
   \[
   t = p
   \]
   So, the value of a treeki is the same as the value of a palu.

Now we substitute \( t = p \) into the equation \( 2t = p + 2g \):
\[
2p = p + 2g
\]
Subtracting \( p \) from both sides, we get:
\[
p = 2g
\]
Since \( s = g \), we also have \( p = 2s \). Therefore, the value of a palu is twice the value of a squig or a goolee.

To find out how many paljus are equal to one treeki and one goolee, we use the fact that \( t = p \) and \( g = s \):
\[
t + g = p + s = 2s + s = 3s
\]
Since \( p = 2s \), we can express \( 3s \) in terms of paljus:
\[
3s = \frac{3}{2}p

So, one treeki and one goolee is equal to \(\frac{3}{2}\) paljus.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[

Now, we perform each multiplication:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, we verify these values by substituting \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the coefficient of \(t^2\) and \(t\) equations.

For the coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]

For the coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]

Both equations are satisfied, confirming that \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) are correct.

Finally, we find \(a + b\):

   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x \geq a\), which means the graph is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\). In this case, the graph intersects every horizontal line at most once.

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x < a\), which means the graph is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\). In this case, the graph intersects every horizontal line at most once.

3. **At \(x = a\):**
   The value of the function at \(x = a\) is \(f(a) = a^2\) from the first piece and \(f(a) = a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\) from the second piece. For the function to be continuous at \(x = a\), these two values must be equal:

If \(a = 0\), the graph is a horizontal line at \(y = 0\), which intersects every horizontal line at most once. If \(a > 0\), the parabola \(y = ax^2\) will intersect the horizontal line \(y = a^2 + 2a\) at two points (since it is a parabola opening upwards), which means the graph intersects this horizontal line more than once.

Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

The equation \((x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c\) is now in the standard form \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\), where the center of the circle is \((5, -3)\) and the radius \( r \) is \(\sqrt{34 - c}\).

We are given that the radius is 1, so we set \(\sqrt{34 - c} = 1\):
\[ \sqrt{34 - c} = 1 \]
To eliminate the square root, we square both sides of the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1^2 \]
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]

"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[

For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).

We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.

Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.

We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) must not be a solution to the cubic equation when \(f(f(x)) = x\).

To find such \(\lambda\), we substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation and check if it satisfies the equation:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.

\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.

Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.

Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[

For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.

Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[

"To solve for \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The given expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, let's simplify the numerator. Notice that we can group the terms as follows:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formula for cosine, \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, let's simplify the denominator. Similarly, we can group the terms as follows:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

Using the angle addition formula for sine, \(\sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B\), we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute these simplified forms back into the original expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this further, we can use the identity \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\) and \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\). However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the expression can be rewritten using the tangent of a sum formula. Notice that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]

This expression is in the form of \(\tan(45^\circ + \alpha)\) where \(\alpha = 20^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[

"To solve the problem of arranging the letters in the word ""ELLIPSE"" in a specific order, we need to understand the constraints given. The word ""ELLIPSE"" consists of 8 letters where the letter ""E"" appears 4 times, and the letters ""L"", ""I"", ""P"", and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by the formula:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""ELLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 8.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_1 \)) is 4.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.

"To determine the last digit of \(42!\), we need to find the remainder when \(42!\) is divided by 10. This is equivalent to finding the last digit of the product of all integers from 1 to 42.

First, observe that \(10 = 2 \times 5\). Therefore, if \(42!\) contains at least one factor of 2 and one factor of 5, it will be divisible by 10, and the last digit will be 0.

Let's check the number of times 2 and 5 appear in the prime factorization of \(42!\):

1. **Counting the number of factors of 2 in \(42!\):**
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{4} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{8} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{16} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{32} \right\rfloor

   \[
   = 21 + 10 + 5 + 2 + 1 = 39

2. **Counting the number of factors of 5 in \(42!\):**
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{42}{5} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{42}{25} \right\rfloor
   \]
   \[
   = 8 + 1 = 9
   \]

Since there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in \(42!\), \(42!\) contains at least one factor of 10. Therefore, \(42!\) is divisible by 10, and the last digit of \(42!\) is 0.

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) for \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), the function simplifies to:
\[ f(0, y) = y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y \]
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = x \]
The maximum value of \( y \) and \( x \) in the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) on the boundary is 1.

Next, let's consider the interior of the domain. To find the critical points, we need to take the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \) and set them to zero.

The partial derivative with respect to \( x \) is:
\[ \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
Setting this equal to zero, we get:
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} = y \frac{x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} \]
\[ \sqrt{1 - y^2} \sqrt{1 - x^2} = yx \]
\[ (1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = y^2 x^2 \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 + y^2 x^2 = y^2 x^2 \]
\[ 1 - y^2 - x^2 = 0 \]
\[ x^2 + y^2 = 1 \]

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. On this circle, we can use the parametric equations \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into the function \( f(x, y) \), we get:
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} \]
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta \]
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta \]
\[ f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = 1 \]

Therefore, the value of the function \( f(x, y) \) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 1. Since this is the same as the maximum value we found on the boundary, the maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) in the entire domain is:

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\) with vertices \(O\), \(A\), and \(B\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\):

\[

The area of the triangle \(OAB\) is half the magnitude of the cross product:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \frac{1}{2} \cdot 6\sqrt{5} = 3\sqrt{5}

We can express \( z \) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, \( \frac{1}{z} = e^{-i\theta} \), and the equation becomes:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \( e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta \), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Thus,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \( \theta \) that satisfies this equation is \( \theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5} \). Therefore, \( z \) can be either \( e^{i\pi/5} \) or \( e^{-i\pi/5} \).

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{i\cdot17\pi} = e^{i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{i\pi} = (e^{i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{i\pi} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot85\cdot\pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot(16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\cdot16\pi} \cdot e^{-i\pi} = (e^{-i\cdot2\pi})^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = 1^8 \cdot e^{-i\pi} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore,

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To find the area of triangle \( \triangle EGN \), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( \triangle ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that \( G \) is the centroid, the line segment \( GN \) is parallel to \( BC \) and \( GM \) is parallel to \( AB \). This means that \( \triangle EGN \) is similar to \( \triangle ABC \) by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion, because corresponding angles are equal when lines are parallel.

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the centroid. Since \( G \) divides each median in the ratio 2:1, the distance from \( G \) to any side of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the distance from the corresponding vertex to the opposite side. Therefore, the ratio of the sides of \( \triangle EGN \) to \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \frac{1}{3} \).

The ratio of the areas of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the ratio of the area of \( \triangle EGN \) to the area of \( \triangle ABC \) is \( \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{1}{9} \).

From the problem, we know:

- The eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500.

Using the formula for the \(n\)-th term, we can write the equations for the second and eighth terms:
\[a_2 = a_1 + (2-1)d = a_1 + d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + (8-1)d = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

"To determine the number of positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find all \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

Since we are looking for positive integers \( n > 1 \), we exclude 1 from the list. The remaining divisors are:
\[ 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24 \]

There are 7 divisors in this list. Therefore, there are 7 positive integers \( n > 1 \) for which \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power.

The final answer is:
\[ \boxed{7} \]","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many Viiesendis mints are in the collection, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the value of each type of coin.
2. Set up an equation based on the total value of the coins.
3. Solve the equation for the number of Viiesendis mints.

First, let's identify the value of each type of coin:
- A kõik is worth 5 senti.
- A Viiesendis is worth 10 senti.

Next, let's denote the number of kõikes by \( k \) and the number of Viiesendis mints by \( v \). According to the problem, the total value of all the coins is 75 senti. Therefore, we can write the following equation:

\[ 5k + 10v = 75 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing every term by 5:

\[ k + 2v = 15 \]

Since the problem states that all coins are either kõikes or Viiesendis mints, and there are no other types of coins, we need to find integer solutions for \( k \) and \( v \). We can express \( k \) in terms of \( v \):

\[ k = 15 - 2v \]

For \( k \) to be a non-negative integer, \( 15 - 2v \) must be a non-negative integer. This means:

\[ 15 - 2v \geq 0 \]
\[ 15 \geq 2v \]
\[ v \leq \frac{15}{2} \]
\[ v \leq 7.5 \]

Since \( v \) must be a whole number, the possible values for \( v \) are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. However, we need to check if these values satisfy the equation \( k + 2v = 15 \) and ensure that \( k \) is a non-negative integer.

Let's check each value of \( v \):

- If \( v = 0 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(0) = 15 \).
- If \( v = 1 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(1) = 13 \).
- If \( v = 2 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(2) = 11 \).
- If \( v = 3 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(3) = 9 \).
- If \( v = 4 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(4) = 7 \).
- If \( v = 5 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(5) = 5 \).
- If \( v = 6 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(6) = 3 \).
- If \( v = 7 \), then \( k = 15 - 2(7) = 1 \).

All these values of \( v \) give non-negative integer values for \( k \). However, the problem does not specify the exact number of kõikes, so we can conclude that the number of Viiesendis mints can be any of these values. But if we need to find the number of Viiesendis mints specifically, we need more information. Since the problem only asks for the number of Viiesendis mints and does not specify any additional conditions, we can assume the problem is asking for a specific solution.

Given the problem's structure and the logical steps, the most logical answer is:

"To determine the probability that the sum of two randomly chosen numbers from the set \(\{1, 2, 3, 4\}\) is even, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of possible outcomes:**
   - There are 4 choices for the first number.
   - There are 4 choices for the second number.
   - Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:
     \[
     4 \times 4 = 16
     \]

2. **Determine the conditions for the sum to be even:**
   - The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

3. **Count the number of even and odd numbers in the set:**
   - Even numbers: \(2, 4\) (2 numbers)
   - Odd numbers: \(1, 3\) (2 numbers)

4. **Calculate the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - **Both numbers are even:**
     - There are 2 choices for the first even number.
     - There are 2 choices for the second even number.
     - Therefore, the number of outcomes where both numbers are even is:
       \[
       2 \times 2 = 4
       \]
   - **Both numbers are odd:**
     - There are 2 choices for the first odd number.
     - There are 2 choices for the second odd number.
     - Therefore, the number of outcomes where both numbers are odd is:
       \[
       2 \times 2 = 4
       \]
   - Total number of favorable outcomes:
     \[
     4 + 4 = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the probability:**
   - The probability of an event is given by the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes.
   - Therefore, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is:
     \[
     \frac{8}{16} = \frac{1}{2}
     \]

Thus, the probability that the sum of the two chosen numbers is even is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{2}}\).","[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",\frac{13}{18},"[13/18, '\\frac{13}{18}']",False
"To determine the value of \( b \) for the point \((a, b)\) that lies on the line given by the equation \(3x + 2y = 12\), we can follow these steps:

1. Substitute the given value of \( a \) into the equation.
2. Solve for \( b \).

Given:
\[ a = 4 \]
The equation of the line is:
\[ 3x + 2y = 12 \]

Substitute \( a = 4 \) into the equation:
\[ 3(4) + 2b = 12 \]

Simplify the left-hand side:
\[ 12 + 2b = 12 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( b \):
\[ 2b = 12 - 12 \]
\[ 2b = 0 \]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( b \):
\[ b = \frac{0}{2} \]
\[ b = 0 \]

Therefore, the value of \( b \) is \(\boxed{0}\).","[0, '0']",0,"[0, '0']",True
"To determine the area of the shaded region in the given grid, we need to analyze the shapes formed by the shaded areas and the grid lines.

The grid is a 4x5 grid, meaning it consists of 4 rows and 5 columns of 1x1 squares. The shaded region consists of two right triangles. Let's analyze each triangle separately.

1. The first triangle is formed by the points \((0, 4)\), \((0, 0)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is a right triangle with a base of 2 units and a height of 4 units. The area \(A_1\) of this triangle is given by:
   \[
   A_1 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 4 = 4 \text{ square units}
   \]

2. The second triangle is formed by the points \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((2, 0)\). This is also a right triangle with a base of 1 unit (the horizontal distance from \((2, 0)\) to \((3, 4)\)) and a height of 4 units (the vertical distance from \((2, 0)\) to \((0, 4)\)). The area \(A_2\) of this triangle is given by:
   \[
   A_2 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 4 = 2 \text{ square units}
   \]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two triangles:
\[
A_{\text{total}} = A_1 + A_2 = 4 + 2 = 6 \text{ square units}

Thus, the area of the shaded region is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",10,"[10, '10']",False
"To determine the smallest positive 450-digit number where all digits are either 0 or 1, we need to consider the structure of such a number. The smallest possible number with a given number of digits is the one that has the smallest non-zero digit in the highest place value position and all other digits as zero.

In this case, the smallest non-zero digit is 1, and it should be in the highest place value position, which is the 450th place. Therefore, the smallest 450-digit number where all digits are either 0 or 1 is:

\[ 1000\ldots000 \]

"To determine the probability that the cube will land on a square that is both in the top row and the left column, we need to analyze the structure of the cube and the possible outcomes.

First, let's identify the total number of squares on the cube. The cube has 6 faces, and each face is divided into a 2x2 grid, so each face has 4 squares. Therefore, the total number of squares on the cube is:
\[ 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Next, we need to identify the number of squares that are both in the top row and the left column. By examining the diagram, we can see that there is only one square that meets this criterion: the square in the top-left corner of the front face.

Since each face is equally likely to land face up, and each face has an equal number of squares, the probability of any specific square landing face up is the same. Therefore, the probability that the cube will land on the top-left corner square is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. There is 1 favorable outcome (the top-left corner square) and 24 possible outcomes (the total number of squares on the cube), so the probability is:
\[ \frac{1}{24} \]

Thus, the probability that the cube will land on a square that is both in the top row and the left column is:
\[ \boxed{\frac{1}{24}} \]","[1/24, '\\frac{1}{24}']",\frac{1}{2},"[1/2, '\\frac{1}{2}']",False
"To find the sum of the digits of the number \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the expression. Notice that \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000}
\]

This fraction is a decimal number. To convert it to a decimal, we perform the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
4321 \div 20000000 = 0.00021605
\]

Next, we sum the digits of the decimal number \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 0 + 5 = 14

Thus, the sum of the digits of the number \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\) is \(\boxed{14}\).","[14, '14']",14,"[14, '14']",True
"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Next, we use the known value of \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \sin 80^\circ\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ\). We use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression:

\[
\sin x \sin (60^\circ - x) \sin (60^\circ + x) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 3x
\]

In this case, let \(x = 20^\circ\). Then:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin (60^\circ - 20^\circ) \sin (60^\circ + 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \sin (3 \cdot 20^\circ) = \frac{1}{4} \sin 60^\circ = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}
\]

Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{4} (\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{64} = \frac{9}{256}
\]

Therefore, the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\) is \(\boxed{\frac{9}{256}}\).","[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",\frac{9}{256},"[9/256, '\\frac{9}{256}']",True
"To determine the shape of the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point in three-dimensional space is represented by \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \( r \) is the radial distance from the \( z \)-axis,
- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane (measured from the positive \( x \)-axis),
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \) for all points on the surface. This implies that the surface is a plane parallel to the \( xy \)-plane, located at a height \( c \) above or below the \( xy \)-plane, depending on the sign of \( c \).

Therefore, the shape of the surface given by the equation \( z = c \) is a plane.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

The angle \(\theta\) whose sine is \(\frac{1}{2}\) is \(30^\circ\) (or \(\frac{\pi}{6}\) radians). Since we are asked for the smallest possible angle, the answer is:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) for \( x \) in \( f(x) \):

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]
\[
-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225
\]
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]
\[
-2015 = -2015
\]

Now, we combine all these expanded terms:

\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) + (-49x^2 - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015
\]

We combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15x^2 - 49x^2) + (75x - 490x + 623x) + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015)
\]
\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0
\]
\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x
\]

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -34 \), \( c = 208 \), and \( d = 0 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots is:

\[

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Since \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.
\]

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\). Squaring both sides of the equation \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ) = (3\sqrt{3})^2\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(-\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}) = 27,

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 6 + \frac{2}{\tan^2 10^\circ} = 27,

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + \frac{2}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.
\]

Since \(\tan^2 80^\circ = \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.

Since \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\), we have:

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon where the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\), we start with the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides:

\[
\text{Sum of interior angles} = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
\]

We are given that the sum of the interior angles is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
(n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ
\]

To find \(n\), we first divide both sides of the equation by \(180^\circ\):

\[
n-2 = \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ}
\]

Next, we perform the division:

\[
\frac{1070}{180} = 5.9444\ldots
\]

Since \(n-2\) must be an integer (because \(n\) is the number of sides of a polygon), we round \(5.9444\ldots\) to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:

\[
n-2 = 6

"To solve for the integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to find \( t \) such that:

\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

This congruence can be rewritten as:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

We will solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[
t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1}

Simplify inside the square root:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2}

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2}
\]
\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]
\[

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[

\[

\[

We find that \( 5^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \), so \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \).

Substituting \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \) back into our expression for \( t \):

\[
t = -1 \pm 5

This gives us two potential solutions:

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4

Since \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \).

Finally, we verify that \( t = 4 \) satisfies the original condition:

\[

   The surface area \( A \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = 6s^2

   We know that the surface area is 1 square kuupjalg, so we can set up the equation:

2. **Solve for the side length \( s \):**
   To find \( s \), we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

Next, we multiply the two expressions together:

This is a difference of squares, which follows the formula:

\[

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

For the sequence of odd numbers, the \(n\)-th term is:

\[a_n = 1 + (n-1) \cdot 2 = 2n - 1\]

We need to find the sum of the first 2003 terms of this sequence. The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:

\[S_n = \frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)\]

Substituting \(n = 2003\), \(a_1 = 1\), and \(a_{2003} = 2 \cdot 2003 - 1 = 4005\) into the formula, we get:

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:

"To determine the shortest distance between the two given parallel lines, we start by expressing the parametric equations of the lines. The first line is given by:
\[

and the second line is given by:
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}
\]
Since the lines are parallel, the direction vectors of the lines are scalar multiples of each other. The direction vector of the first line is \(\mathbf{d}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and the direction vector of the second line is \(\mathbf{d}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). We can see that \(\mathbf{d}_2 = 2 \mathbf{d}_1\), confirming that the lines are parallel.

The shortest distance between two parallel lines can be found using the formula for the distance between a point on the first line and the second line, projected onto a vector that is perpendicular to the direction vector of the lines. Let \(\mathbf{a}\) be a vector from a point on the first line to a point on the second line. We can choose the points \(\mathbf{r}_1(0) = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2(0) = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

The shortest distance \(d\) is given by the magnitude of the projection of \(\mathbf{a}\) onto a vector perpendicular to \(\mathbf{d}_1\). This perpendicular vector can be found using the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{d}_1\):

The rectangle spans from \(x = -5\) to \(x = 5\) and from \(y = -4\) to \(y = 4\). Therefore, any point \((x,y)\) inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Next, we apply the distributive property again to each term:

\[

We know that the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, so \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[

We can factor out the scalar multiples of the cross products:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}),
\]

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(AC \perp CD\), and \(AC\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). The area of the trapezoid is given by the formula:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(AC\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(AC \perp CD\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times AC \times h
\]

In \(\triangle ACD\), \(AC\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAD\), so by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{h}
\]
Since \(AB\) is the hypotenuse of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(AC\) is the angle bisector, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is proportional to the area of \(\triangle ABC\) based on the ratio of the bases \(AD\) and \(BC\). The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
The ratio of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) to \(\triangle ABC\) is the same as the ratio of \(AD\) to \(BC\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Since the total area of the trapezoid is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]
Substituting the ratio, we get:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + \frac{b}{a} \times [\triangle ACD] = 42 \implies [\triangle ACD] \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42 \implies [\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
Since \(a + b = \frac{84}{h}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
[\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{\frac{84}{h}}{a}\right) = 42 \implies [\triangle ACD] \left(\frac{84}{a \cdot h}\right) = 42 \implies [\triangle ACD] = 42 \times \frac{a \cdot h}{84} = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
We know that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(\frac{1}{2} \times a \times h\), and from the trapezoid area formula, we have \(a \times h = 84 - b \times h\). However, since \(AC\) bisects \(\angle BAD\) and \(AC \perp CD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is simply half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\), which simplifies to:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[

   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

First, identify the values of \( m \), \( n \), \( p \), and \( q \) from the fractions:
- For \( \frac{7}{30} \), \( m = 7 \) and \( n = 30 \).
- For \( \frac{10}{21} \), \( p = 10 \) and \( q = 21 \).

Next, substitute these values into the operation formula:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: We need to find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) is separated by the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) when moving around the circle.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (the number of ways to rotate the circle) to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following two ways: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). These are the only two arrangements where the segments intersect. Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total number of distinct arrangements}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) times the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the shaded region is given as \(\frac{5}{12}\) times the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

The shaded region consists of two segments: one from the smaller circle and one from the larger circle. The area of the segment of a circle is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Area of a segment} = \text{Area of the sector} - \text{Area of the triangle}
\]

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the central angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the smaller circle with radius 1 and central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1^2 \times \theta = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]

The area of the triangle formed by the radii of the smaller circle and the chord \(DC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin \theta = \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta
\]

Therefore, the area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2} - \frac{1}{2} \sin \theta = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2}
\]

Similarly, the area of the sector of the larger circle with radius 2 and central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2^2 \times \theta = 2\theta
\]

The area of the triangle formed by the radii of the larger circle and the chord \(DC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the triangle} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin \theta = 2 \sin \theta
\]

Therefore, the area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = 2\theta - 2 \sin \theta = 2(\theta - \sin \theta)
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the segments of the two circles:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + 2(\theta - \sin \theta) = \frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} + \frac{4(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2}
\]

We know that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5(\theta - \sin \theta)}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

To solve for \(\theta\), we first divide both sides by 5:
\[
\frac{\theta - \sin \theta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

We need to find the value of \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation. By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) is a solution because:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{3} \right) = \sin \left( \pi - \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

However, this does not satisfy the equation. Instead, we find that \(\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}\) is a solution because:
\[
\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{3} \right) = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]
\[
\theta - \sin \theta = \frac{\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Therefore, the correct value is:
\[
\theta = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Thus, the measure of the smaller angle \(\angle ADC\) is:

"To determine how many cylindrical prisms are needed to fill a spherical tank with a radius of 6 cm, we need to calculate the volumes of both the cylindrical prism and the sphere and then divide the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylindrical prism.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical prism. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical prism, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the sphere. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the sphere, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical prisms are required to fill the sphere. We do this by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylindrical prism:
\[ \text{Number of cylindrical prisms} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

"To determine the number of ways to form a 5-member allkomitee from a committee of 8 vabariiklast and 6 demokraati, with the condition that at least one member from each part is included, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the committee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a committee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a committee consisting only of vabariiklast or only of demokraati).

1. **Calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee from 14 members:**

   The total number of ways to choose 5 members from 14 is given by the combination formula \( \binom{n}{k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \), where \( n \) is the total number of items to choose from, \( k \) is the number of items to choose, and \( ! \) denotes factorial.

   \[
   \binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member committee consisting only of vabariiklast:**

   The number of ways to choose 5 vabariiklast from 8 is:

   \[
   \binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56

   \]

2. The product of the three integers divided by their arithmetic mean is 24:
   \[
   \frac{abc}{\frac{a+b+c}{3}} = 24

   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   \frac{3abc}{a+b+c} = 24

   Substituting \(abc = 120\) into the equation, we have:

   Simplifying further, we get:

   Solving for \(a+b+c\), we find:

Now we need to find three distinct positive integers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) such that \(a < b < c\), \(abc = 120\), and \(a+b+c = 15\). We will test possible values for \(a\), starting with the smallest possible integer.

If \(a = 2\), then \(bc = \frac{120}{2} = 60\) and \(b+c = 15-2 = 13\). We need to find two distinct positive integers \(b\) and \(c\) such that \(bc = 60\) and \(b+c = 13\). We can solve the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 13t + 60 = 0\):
   \[
   t = \frac{13 \pm \sqrt{169 - 240}}{2} = \frac{13 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2} = \frac{13 \pm 7}{2}

   This gives us the solutions \(t = 10\) and \(t = 3\). Therefore, \(b = 3\) and \(c = 10\) (or vice versa, but since \(b < c\), we have \(b = 3\) and \(c = 10\)). So, the integers are \(a = 2\), \(b = 3\), and \(c = 10\).

This simplifies to:

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, it can be rewritten as:

\[
(x - 2)^2 = 4096

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),

\[

However, we need to find the product of only four of these cosines. To do this, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{n} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.

For \(n=7\), we have:

\[
\prod_{k=1}^{7} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^7} = \frac{1}{128}.

This product includes \(\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{6\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{10\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{12\pi}{15} \right), \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right)\).

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(AD = 10\) and \(DM = 1\). We are also given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, \(\angle AMB = \angle AMC = 90^\circ\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

Using the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\), we have:
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), \(AC^2 = 121 + x^2\).

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC).
\]
Since \(BD = AD + DB = 10 + 1 = 11\) and \(CD = CM - DM = x - 1\), we substitute these values into the Law of Cosines:
\[
(2x)^2 = 11^2 + (x-1)^2 - 2 \cdot 11 \cdot (x-1) \cdot \cos(3\theta).
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
4x^2 = 121 + x^2 - 2x + 1 - 22(x-1)\cos(3\theta),
\]
\[
4x^2 = 122 + x^2 - 2x - 22(x-1)\cos(3\theta),
\]
\[
3x^2 + 2x - 122 = -22(x-1)\cos(3\theta).
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
3x^2 + 2x - 122 = -22(x-1)(4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)).
\]
Since \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{BM}{AB} = \frac{x}{\sqrt{121 + x^2}}\), we substitute \(\cos(\theta)\) into the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\) implies a specific geometric relationship. By examining the configuration, we can use the fact that the triangle formed by the points \(B\), \(D\), and \(C\) is similar to the triangle formed by the points \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) with a specific ratio.

By solving the equation or using geometric properties, we find that \(x = 11\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x = 22\).

The circumradius \(R\) of \(\triangle ABC\) can be found using the formula for the circumradius of an isosceles triangle:
\[
R = \frac{a^2}{2\sqrt{a^2 - \frac{b^2}{4}}},
\]
where \(a = AB = AC\) and \(b = BC\). Substituting \(a = \sqrt{121 + 11^2} = \sqrt{242} = 11\sqrt{2}\) and \(b = 22\), we get:
\[
R = \frac{(11\sqrt{2})^2}{2\sqrt{(11\sqrt{2})^2 - \frac{22^2}{4}}} = \frac{242}{2\sqrt{242 - 121}} = \frac{242}{2\sqrt{121}} = \frac{242}{2 \cdot 11} = \frac{242}{22} = 11.

"To find the median of 27 positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by calculating \(3^7\):

\[
3^7 = 2187
\]

The median of a set of 27 numbers is the 14th number when the numbers are arranged in ascending order. To determine the median, we need to consider the properties of the numbers and their sum.

First, let's assume that all 27 numbers are equal. If they were all equal, each number would be:

\[
\frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]

However, since the numbers are positive integers and their sum is 2187, they do not necessarily have to be all equal. Instead, we need to find a configuration where the sum is 2187 and the median is a specific value.

Given that the median is the 14th number in the ordered list, we can start by assuming that the first 13 numbers are as small as possible. The smallest positive integer is 1, so let's assume the first 13 numbers are all 1:

\[
1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 13
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
2187 - 13 = 2174
\]

Now, we need to distribute the remaining sum of 2174 among the last 14 numbers. Since the median is the 14th number, we will assign the smallest possible value to the first 13 of these remaining numbers. Let's assume these 13 numbers are also 1:

\[
1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 13
\]

This leaves us with:

\[
2174 - 13 = 2161
\]

The 14th number, which is the median, will then be:

\[
2161
\]

However, this configuration is not possible because the sum of the first 13 numbers is already 13, and we need to distribute the remaining sum among the last 14 numbers such that the median is a specific value. Let's try another approach.

Given the complexity of the problem, we need to consider the properties of the numbers and their sum. Let's assume that the first 13 numbers are 1, the next 13 numbers are 1, and the 14th number is \(x\):

\[
1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 + x + 1 + 1 + \cdots + 1 = 2187
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
26 + x = 2187
\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[
x = 2187 - 26 = 2161

Thus, the median of the 27 positive integers is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factor the quadratic equation as follows:
\[ (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals determined by the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 3) \) and \( (3, \infty) \).

- For \( y \in (-\infty, 3) \), choose \( y = 0 \):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is true in the interval \( (-\infty, 3) \).

- For \( y \in (3, \infty) \), choose \( y = 4 \):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  So, \( y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \) is false in the interval \( (3, \infty) \).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we substitute back:
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

The solution to the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True

   - Number of female students: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3\)
   - \(135\%\) of the number of female students: \(99.3 \times 1.35 = 134.055\)

   - \(135\%\) of the number of female students: \(41.4 \times 1.35 = 55.65\)
   - Difference: \(55.65 - 61.8 = -6.15\)
   - Since we are looking for the smallest positive difference, we consider the absolute value: \(6.15\)

4. **12th Class:**
   - Number of male students: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8\)
   - Number of female students: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8\)

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are negative, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x - 9\) is negative and \(x + 9\) is positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) < 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x - 9\) and \(x + 9\) are positive, so \((x - 9)(x + 9) > 0\). Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and the expression becomes:

   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x - 36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x - 36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangle in the given figure, we start by analyzing the shape and the given dimensions. The figure consists of a rectangle with a semicircle on each end. The total perimeter of the figure is given as 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width of the rectangle by \( w \). The radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{w}{2} \).

The perimeter of the rectangle is given by:
\[
2l + 2w
\]

The perimeter of each semicircle is half the circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \). The circumference of a full circle is:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{w}{2}\right) = \pi w
\]

Therefore, the perimeter of one semicircle is:
\[
\frac{\pi w}{2}
\]

Since there are two semicircles, the total perimeter of the semicircles is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi w}{2} = \pi w
\]

Adding the perimeter of the rectangle and the perimeters of the semicircles gives the total perimeter of the figure:
\[
2l + 2w + \pi w = 400
\]

We can simplify this equation by factoring out \( w \) from the terms involving \( w \):
\[
2l + w(2 + \pi) = 400
\]

Solving for \( l \), we get:
\[
2l = 400 - w(2 + \pi)
\]
\[
l = 200 - w\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\]

The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = l \times w
\]

Substituting the expression for \( l \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = w \left(200 - w\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)
\]
\[
A = 200w - w^2\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)

This is a quadratic equation in terms of \( w \). To find the maximum area, we need to find the vertex of this parabola. The vertex form of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).

In our equation \( A = -w^2\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right) + 200w \), the coefficients are:
\[
a = -\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right), \quad b = 200
\]

The \( w \)-coordinate of the vertex is:
\[
w = -\frac{200}{2\left(-\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)\right)}
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{2\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)}
\]
\[
w = \frac{200}{2 + \pi}
\]

Now, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{2 + \pi} \) back into the expression for \( l \):
\[
l = 200 - \left(\frac{200}{2 + \pi}\right)\left(1 + \frac{\pi}{2}\right)
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{200(1 + \frac{\pi}{2})}{2 + \pi}
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{200 + 100\pi}{2 + \pi}
\]
\[
l = 200 - \frac{200 + 100\pi}{2 + \pi}
\]
\[
l = \frac{200(2 + \pi) - (200 + 100\pi)}{2 + \pi}

\[
l = \frac{400 + 200\pi - 200 - 100\pi}{2 + \pi}

\[
l = \frac{200 + 100\pi}{2 + \pi}
\]
\[
l = \frac{100(2 + \pi)}{2 + \pi}

\[
l = 100

\[
A = l \times w = 100 \times \frac{200}{2 + \pi}

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in the right triangle \( \triangle RST \) where \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\), we start by identifying the sides of the triangle relative to angle \(R\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. Here, \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) means that the side opposite angle \(R\) is 2 units and the hypotenuse is 5 units.

Given that \( \triangle RST \) is a right triangle with the right angle at \(S\), the side opposite angle \(R\) is \(ST = 2\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\). We need to find the length of the side \(RS\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2

\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2

\[

Subtracting 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root (since \(RS\) is a length):
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of angle \(T\) is the ratio of the length of the side opposite angle \(T\) to the length of the hypotenuse. The side opposite angle \(T\) is \(RS = \sqrt{21}\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT = 5\). Therefore:

\sin{T} = \frac{RS}{RT} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

This gives us three solutions:

\[
x = 0, \quad x^2 = 2 \implies x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Calculate each term:

\[
(\sqrt{2})^4 = 4, \quad 2(\sqrt{2})^2 = 4
\]

Substitute these values back into the function:

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

Since \((- \sqrt{2})^4 = (\sqrt{2})^4 = 4\) and \((- \sqrt{2})^2 = (\sqrt{2})^2 = 2\), we get:

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{4}{2} - \frac{8}{2} + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \(\frac{5}{2}\). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

The distance is given in the form \(\frac{\sqrt{a}}{b}\), where \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). Thus, \( a + b = 10 + 2 = 12 \).

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) is not in the domain \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]
 So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = 294 \]

Finally, we find \( f^{-1}(6) = 2 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):

"To determine the coordinates of point \( P \) in a regular octahedron with vertices at \((1,0,0)\), \((-1,0,0)\), \((0,1,0)\), \((0,-1,0)\), \((0,0,1)\), and \((0,0,-1)\), we start by noting that the distances from \( P \) to each of these vertices are given as 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. Let the coordinates of \( P \) be \((x, y, z)\).

The distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((1,0,0)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]

The distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((-1,0,0)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]

The distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((0,1,0)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]

The distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((0,-1,0)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]

The distance from \( P \) to the vertex \((0,0,1)\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2} = 11
\]
Squaring both sides, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121
\]

We now have the following system of equations:
1. \((x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9\)
2. \((x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49\)
3. \(x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2 = 64\)
4. \(x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 = 81\)
5. \(x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 = 121\)

First, subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x+1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 - ((x-1)^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 49 - 9
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
(x+1)^2 - (x-1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Next, subtract the third equation from the fourth:
\[
x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2 - (x^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2) = 81 - 64
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
(y+1)^2 - (y-1)^2 = 17
\]
\[
(y^2 + 2y + 1) - (y^2 - 2y + 1) = 17
\]
\[
4y = 17
\]
\[
y = \frac{17}{4}
\]

Finally, subtract the fourth equation from the fifth:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2 - (x^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2) = 121 - 81
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
(z-1)^2 - (y+1)^2 = 40
\]
\[
(z^2 - 2z + 1) - (y^2 + 2y + 1) = 40
\]
\[
z^2 - y^2 - 2z - 2y = 40
\]
Substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( y = \frac{17}{4} \):
\[
z^2 - \left(\frac{17}{4}\right)^2 - 2z - 2\left(\frac{17}{4}\right) = 40
\]
\[
z^2 - \frac{289}{16} - 2z - \frac{34}{4} = 40
\]
\[
z^2 - \frac{289}{16} - 2z - \frac{136}{16} = 40
\]
\[
z^2 - 2z - \frac{425}{16} = 40
\]
Convert 40 to a fraction with a denominator of 16:
\[
z^2 - 2z - \frac{425}{16} = \frac{640}{16}
\]
\[
z^2 - 2z - \frac{1065}{16} = 0
\]
Multiply through by 16 to clear the fraction:
\[
16z^2 - 32z - 1065 = 0
\]
Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( z = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 16 \), \( b = -32 \), and \( c = -1065 \):
\[
z = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{(-32)^2 - 4 \cdot 16 \cdot (-1065)}}{2 \cdot 16}

\[
z = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{1024 + 68160}}{32}
\]
\[
z = \frac{32 \pm \sqrt{69184}}{32}

\[
z = \frac{32 \pm 259.2}{32}

This gives us two solutions:

"To solve the problem, we need to use the given relationship between the mass of the balls and their rotational kinetic energy. The rotational kinetic energy \( K \) of an object is given by the formula:

\[ K = \frac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \]

where \( I \) is the moment of inertia and \( \omega \) is the angular velocity. For a solid sphere, the moment of inertia \( I \) is given by:

\[ I = \frac{2}{5} m r^2 \]

where \( m \) is the mass and \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. Since the radius of the pehmepalls and pesapalls is the same, we can simplify the rotational kinetic energy formula for each ball to:

\[ K = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{2}{5} m r^2 \right) \omega^2 = \frac{1}{5} m r^2 \omega^2 \]

Given that the rotational kinetic energy of each ball is proportional to the product of its mass and its angular velocity squared, we can write:

\[ K_{\text{peh}} = \frac{1}{5} m_{\text{peh}} r^2 \omega_{\text{peh}}^2 \]
\[ K_{\text{pes}} = \frac{1}{5} m_{\text{pes}} r^2 \omega_{\text{pes}}^2 \]

Since the rotational kinetic energies of the peh and pes balls are equal, we have:

\[ \frac{1}{5} m_{\text{peh}} r^2 \omega_{\text{peh}}^2 = \frac{1}{5} m_{\text{pes}} r^2 \omega_{\text{pes}}^2 \]

We can cancel out the common factors \(\frac{1}{5} r^2\) from both sides of the equation:

\[ m_{\text{peh}} \omega_{\text{peh}}^2 = m_{\text{pes}} \omega_{\text{pes}}^2 \]

Rearranging the equation to solve for the ratio of the angular velocities, we get:

\[ \frac{\omega_{\text{peh}}^2}{\omega_{\text{pes}}^2} = \frac{m_{\text{pes}}}{m_{\text{peh}}} \]

Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain:

\[ \frac{\omega_{\text{peh}}}{\omega_{\text{pes}}} = \sqrt{\frac{m_{\text{pes}}}{m_{\text{peh}}}} \]

Substituting the given masses \( m_{\text{peh}} = 200 \) g and \( m_{\text{pes}} = 150 \) g, we get:

\[ \frac{\omega_{\text{peh}}}{\omega_{\text{pes}}} = \sqrt{\frac{150}{200}} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \]

We need to find the value of the expression \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. Then we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]

Let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\). Then \(a + b = -2\) and:

\[
ab = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]

From the equation \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab + S_3 = 0 \implies S_3 = -ab.
\]

Similarly, we can express \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) in terms of \(a\) and \(b\):

\[
S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4.
\]

Since \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we have:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 = \frac{2}{\alpha_3\alpha_4} \quad \text{and} \quad \alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{\alpha_1\alpha_2}.
\]

Substituting \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = x\) and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = \frac{2}{x}\) into the equation \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), we get:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = x + \frac{2}{x} + S_3 = 0 \implies S_3 = -x - \frac{2}{x}.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 = -S_3 = x + \frac{2}{x}.
\]

The quadratic equation whose roots are \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) is:

\[
t^2 - (S_1 + S_2)t + S_1S_2 = 0 \implies t^2 - \left(-x - \frac{2}{x}\right)t + S_1S_2 = 0 \implies t^2 + \left(x + \frac{2}{x}\right)t + S_1S_2 = 0.
\]

Since \(S_1S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\), we have:

\[
t^2 + \left(x + \frac{2}{x}\right)t + 2 = 0.
\]

The discriminant of this quadratic equation must be a perfect square for \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) to be real numbers. The discriminant is:

\[
\left(x + \frac{2}{x}\right)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 = x^2 + 4 + \frac{4}{x^2} - 8 = x^2 - 4 + \frac{4}{x^2} = \left(x - \frac{2}{x}\right)^2.
\]

Since the discriminant is a perfect square, the roots of the quadratic equation are:

\[
t = \frac{-\left(x + \frac{2}{x}\right) \pm \left(x - \frac{2}{x}\right)}{2}.
\]

This gives us two solutions:

\[
t = \frac{-x - \frac{2}{x} + x - \frac{2}{x}}{2} = \frac{-\frac{4}{x}}{2} = -\frac{2}{x},
\]
\[
t = \frac{-x - \frac{2}{x} - x + \frac{2}{x}}{2} = \frac{-2x}{2} = -x.
\]

Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is \(\{-2, -2, -2\}\). The answer is:

"Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the cost of one pliatsit.
- Let \( y \) be the cost of one suur kustut us.

From the problem, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( 3x + 2y = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5x + y = 1.82 \)

We can solve this system using the method of elimination. First, we will eliminate \( y \) by making the coefficients of \( y \) in both equations the same. We can do this by multiplying the second equation by 2:
\[ 2(5x + y) = 2(1.82) \]
\[ 10x + 2y = 3.64 \]

Now we have the system:
1. \( 3x + 2y = 1.24 \)
2. \( 10x + 2y = 3.64 \)

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( y \):
\[ (10x + 2y) - (3x + 2y) = 3.64 - 1.24 \]
\[ 7x = 2.40 \]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 7:
\[ x = \frac{2.40}{7} \]
\[ x = 0.342857 \]

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{137}{500}\) into a decimal, we can perform the division of 137 by 500. Here are the steps:

1. Set up the division: \(137 \div 500\).
2. Since 137 is less than 500, we know the decimal will start with 0. We can write it as \(0.274\) and continue the division to confirm.

Let's do the division step by step:

- \(500\) goes into \(1370\) (we add a zero after 137 to make it 1370) \(2\) times because \(500 \times 2 = 1000\). So, we write \(2\) after the decimal point.
- Subtract \(1000\) from \(1370\) to get a remainder of \(370\).
- Bring down another zero to make it \(3700\). Now, \(500\) goes into \(3700\) \(7\) times because \(500 \times 7 = 3500\). So, we write \(7\) next to the \(2\).
- Subtract \(3500\) from \(3700\) to get a remainder of \(200\).
- Bring down another zero to make it \(2000\). Now, \(500\) goes into \(2000\) \(4\) times because \(500 \times 4 = 2000\). So, we write \(4\) next to the \(7\).
- Subtract \(2000\) from \(2000\) to get a remainder of \(0\).

Since the remainder is now \(0\), the division is complete. Therefore, the decimal representation of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's consider the rectangle \(ABCD\) with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). The coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

We need to find the region inside the rectangle where a point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices. The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

For a point \((x, y)\) to be closer to \(O\) than to \(A\), we need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
1. For vertex \(B = (a, b)\):
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
2. For vertex \(C = (a, -b)\):
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
3. For vertex \(D = (-a, -b)\):
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities define four regions within the rectangle. Each region is a quarter of the rectangle, and the point \((x, y)\) must lie within the intersection of these regions to be closer to \(O\) than to any vertex.

The intersection of these regions forms a smaller square centered at \(O\) with side length \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}\). However, since \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the side length of the smaller square, we get:
\[
\text{Side length} = \frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{2kb} = \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{2kb} = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{2kb} = \frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2k}
\]

The area of the smaller square is:
\[
\left(\frac{b(k^2 + 1)}{2k}\right)^2 = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
4ab = 4(kb)b = 4kb^2
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)^2}{4k^2}}{4kb^2} = \frac{(k^2 + 1)^2}{16k^3}

Thus, the final answer is:

   This tells us that 54 divided by 6 gives a quotient of 9.

"To solve for \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

2. Determine the maximum amount they can spend on pens and pencils (which is the total amount of money they have).
3. Calculate how much more money they have compared to what they would have if they spent all their money on pens and pencils.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money they have:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
\]

We can add these amounts step by step:
\[
27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70

\[
62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07

So, the total amount of money they have is $126.59.

Next, we need to determine the maximum amount they can spend on pens and pencils. Since they can spend all their money on pens and pencils, the maximum amount they can spend is $126.59.

Since they are spending all their money on pens and pencils, the amount of money they have compared to what they would have if they spent all their money on pens and pencils is:

- 20 students scored 80 points each.
- 8 students scored 90 points each.
- 2 students scored 100 points each.

So, the total score is:

\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Next, we add these scores together:

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[
2 + n + (n-1) = 2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[
3 + (2n-9) + n = 3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + (14 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15
\]
Since all the sums are equal to 15, our solution is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is:
\[

"To determine how much farther Jim travels compared to Martha, we need to calculate the distances each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim travels along the diagonal of the rectangle. The formula for the length of the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 jalga and the width \(w\) is 300 jalga. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ jalga} \]
So, Jim travels 500 jalga.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha travels along the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]
Substituting the values for the length and width, we get:
\[ P = 2 \times 400 + 2 \times 300 = 800 + 600 = 1400 \text{ jalga} \]
So, Martha travels 1400 jalga.

Now, we need to find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:
\[ \text{Difference} = 1400 - 500 = 900 \text{ jalga} \]
Therefore, Martha travels 900 jalga farther than Jim. The answer is:
\[ \boxed{900} \]","[900, '900']",200,"[200, '200']",False
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real root.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the length of the diagonal \(BD\) in the quadrilateral \(ABCD\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles formed by the given side lengths.

First, let's consider triangle \(ABD\). We know the lengths of \(AB = 6\), \(AD = 5\), and \(BD\) is the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have:
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
BD^2 = 6^2 + 5^2 = 36 + 25 = 61
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[
BD = \sqrt{61}
\]

Next, let's verify this result by considering triangle \(BCD\). We know the lengths of \(BC = 5\), \(CD = 4\), and \(BD\) is the hypotenuse. Using the Pythagorean theorem again, we have:
\[
BD^2 = BC^2 + CD^2
\]
Substituting the given values:
\[
BD^2 = 5^2 + 4^2 = 25 + 16 = 41
\]
However, this result does not match our previous calculation. Let's recheck the problem setup and calculations.

Upon re-evaluation, we find that the correct approach is to use the coordinates of the points to find the distance \(BD\).

Given:
- \(A = (-3, 3)\)
- \(B = (3, 0)\)
- \(C = (0, -4)\)
- \(D = (0, 0)\)

We use the distance formula to find \(BD\):
\[
BD = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}
\]
Substituting the coordinates of \(B\) and \(D\):
\[
BD = \sqrt{(3 - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2} = \sqrt{3^2 + 0^2} = \sqrt{9} = 3
\]

Thus, the length of the diagonal \(BD\) is:
