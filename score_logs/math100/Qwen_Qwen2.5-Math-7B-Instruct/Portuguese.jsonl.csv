"To find the value of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have \(DF = 10\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since triangle \(DEF\) is a right triangle with \(\angle E = 90^\circ\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the value of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the point \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) around the origin:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back so that \( c \) is at its original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 people and the number of permutations of 3 people is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table if Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\):

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in \(T_k\) is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15

\[
k = 3

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term \(T_k\):

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) = (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we need to find the remainder when \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \) is divided by 7. We can do this by finding the remainders of 4, 6, and 8 when divided by 7 and then multiplying these remainders together.

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}
\]

So, we have:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, multiply 4 and 6:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Next, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

So, \( 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7} \). Therefore:

\[

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to coincide with its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. When a regular pentagon is rotated, it will coincide with its original position at specific angles.

The full rotation of a circle is 360 degrees. Since the pentagon has five sides, it will coincide with its original position after rotating through an angle that is a fraction of the full circle corresponding to one-fifth of its sides. This angle is calculated as follows:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). This means that the point \( D(6, -1) \) is not the correct fourth vertex. Instead, we need to consider the possibility that \( D \) is such that \( B \) and \( C \) are the midpoints of the diagonals.

Let's assume \( B \) is the midpoint of \( AC \) and \( C \) is the midpoint of \( BD \). This would mean:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (7, 4)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 4
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 7 \implies 6+x = 14 \implies x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 4 \implies 8+y = 8 \implies y = 0
\]

Thus, the coordinates of the fourth vertex \( D \) are \( (8, 0) \). Therefore, the value of \( x + y \) is:
\[
x + y = 8 + 0 = 8

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find the value of \(\tan A\).

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

"To calculate \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) de cabeça, we can use algebraic manipulation to simplify the expression. Notice that the expression \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) can be rewritten in a form that allows us to use the difference of squares.

First, let's rewrite the expression:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 99^2 + 99 + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{2}\right)\]

However, a simpler approach is to recognize that:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = (100-1)^2 + (100-1) + 1\]

Now, expand \((100-1)^2\):
\[(100-1)^2 = 100^2 - 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 1 + 1^2 = 10000 - 200 + 1 = 9801\]

So the expression becomes:
\[99^2 + 99 + 1 = 9801 + 99 + 1\]

Now, add these numbers together:
\[9801 + 99 = 9900\]
\[9900 + 1 = 9901\]

Therefore, the value of \(99^2 + 99 + 1\) is \(\boxed{10000}\).","[10000, '10000']",9901,"[9901, '9901']",False

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the context of matrices, we have

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| \le \sqrt{\text{tr}(A^T A)} = \sqrt{4 + 13} = \sqrt{17}.
\]

To check if this bound is achievable, we need to find a vector \(\bold{v}\) such that \(\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{17}\). This occurs when \(\bold{v}\) is an eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue \(\lambda = 17\), but since \( A^T A \) has eigenvalues \(\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\), we need to check the maximum value directly.

By direct calculation, we find that the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) is indeed \(\sqrt{17}\) when \(x = \frac{3}{\sqrt{17}}\) and \(y = \frac{2}{\sqrt{17}}\). Therefore, the smallest positive number \( C \) is

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"Let's define the weights of the treeks, squigs, and goolees as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one treek.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one squig.
- Let \( g \) be the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. Dez treeks pesam tanto quanto three squigs e um goolee. This can be written as:
   \[
   10t = 3s + g
   \]
2. Dois treeks e um goolee são iguais em Peso a um squig. This can be written as:
   \[
   2t + g = s
   \]

We need to find the weight of one squig in terms of the weight of one treek, i.e., we need to express \( s \) in terms of \( t \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[
g = s - 2t
\]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[
10t = 3s + (s - 2t)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
10t = 4s - 2t
\]
Add \( 2t \) to both sides to isolate the terms involving \( s \) on one side:
\[
12t = 4s
\]
Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( s \):
\[
s = 3t
\]

This tells us that the weight of one squig is equal to the weight of three treeks. Therefore, the weight组合 of quantos treeks is equal to the weight of one squig is:

"To find the value of \(a + b\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\). The expanded form is given by:

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product. We multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, we perform the multiplications:

\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms. The like terms are the terms with the same power of \(t\):

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know that this expanded form is equal to the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can equate the coefficients of the corresponding terms:

\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a = 12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6
\]

This gives us the following system of equations:

1. \(3b + 20 = 26\)
2. \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
3. \(-10 + ab = -16\)
4. \(-2a = 6\)

We start by solving the fourth equation for \(a\):

\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = \frac{6}{-2} = -3
\]

Next, we substitute \(a = -3\) into the first equation to solve for \(b\):

\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 26 - 20 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = \frac{6}{3} = 2
\]

Now that we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\), we can find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1
\]

Therefore, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cylinder. The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by:

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. The problem states that the tank is being filled with water at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and that the level of the water is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is equal to the rate at which water is being added, and the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is 4 meters per hour. We can express these rates as:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Using the chain rule, we can relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since the volume \( V \) is given by \( V = \pi r^2 h \), we can find \( \frac{dV}{dh} \) by differentiating \( V \) with respect to \( h \):

\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting \( \frac{dV}{dh} \) and \( \frac{dh}{dt} \) into the chain rule equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we find \( r \) by taking the positive square root of both sides:

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this piece occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). As \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\) if \(a > 0\) and approaches \(\infty\) if \(a < 0\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\).

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the two pieces of the function.

Therefore, we need:
\[a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.\]

To solve this inequality, we rearrange it:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
We factor out \(a\):
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
We factor the quadratic expression:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]

We determine the roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point in each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[(-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[(-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[(1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[(3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

We also check the roots:
- For \(a = -1\):
  \[(-1)(-1 - 2)(-1 + 1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 0\):
  \[(0)(0 - 2)(0 + 1) = (0)(-2)(1) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 2\):
  \[(2)(2 - 2)(2 + 1) = (2)(0)(3) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 2]\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms separately.

### Completing the square for the \( x \)-terms:
1. Start with the \( x \)-terms: \( x^2 - 10x \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \).
3. Add and subtract 25 inside the equation: \( x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 \).
4. This can be rewritten as: \( (x-5)^2 - 25 \).

### Completing the square for the \( y \)-terms:
1. Start with the \( y \)-terms: \( y^2 + 6y \).
2. To complete the square, take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \).
3. Add and subtract 9 inside the equation: \( y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 \).
4. This can be rewritten as: \( (y+3)^2 - 9 \).

###Rewriting the original equation:
Substitute the completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constant terms:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Add 34 to both sides of the equation:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

###Identifying the radius:
The equation \( (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \) is now in the standard form \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \), where the radius \( r \) is given by:
\[ r^2 = 34 - c \]
We are given that the radius is 1, so:
\[ 1^2 = 34 - c \]
\[ 1 = 34 - c \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) \right] + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda^2 - 1 = (\lambda - 1)(\lambda + 1)\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 \right] = 0.
\]
For \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide both sides by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding and simplifying, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1) + (2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2) - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda^3 + 2\lambda^2 - \lambda + 2\lambda^2 + \lambda^3 - 2\lambda - \lambda^2 - \lambda - \lambda^2 + \lambda + 1 = 0,

\[
0 + 0 - 2\lambda + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-2\lambda + 1 = 0,

\[
\lambda = \frac{1}{2}.

For \(\lambda = 1\), we have \(f(x) = x\), so there is no \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.
\]
Using the angle addition formulas for sine and cosine, we get:
\[
\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) = \cos 45^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \sin 45^\circ \sin 20^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 20^\circ + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 20^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ),
\]
\[
\sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 45^\circ \cos 40^\circ - \cos 45^\circ \sin 40^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cos 40^\circ - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \sin 40^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ).
\]
Substituting these into the expression, we get:
\[
\frac{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ) + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ)}{\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ) - \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} (\cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ + \cos 40^\circ - \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ + \sin 20^\circ - \cos 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}.

Using the identity \(\cos 40^\circ = \sin 50^\circ\) and \(\sin 40^\circ = \cos 50^\circ\), we get:

- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) occurs when \( y = 0 \), giving \( f(1, 0) = 1 \).

Similarly, if \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) occurs when \( x = 0 \), giving \( f(0, 1) = 1 \).

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then \( f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}.
\]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[
\frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1.
\]
Substituting \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( f(x, x) \), we get:
\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1.

"To find the area of the triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given by two vectors originating from the same point. The area is half the magnitude of the cross product of the vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\).

First, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))
\]

Simplifying each component, we get:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i}(2 + 6) - \mathbf{j}(1 + 9) + \mathbf{k}(-2 + 6) = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{i\pi} = -1. \]

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line passing through \(G\) and parallel to \(BC\) intersects \(AB\) at \(M\) and \(AC\) at \(N\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid \(G\) to the base \(BC\) to the total height from vertex \(A\) to \(BC\). This ratio is \(2/3\) because \(G\) divides the median \(AD\) in the ratio 2:1.

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \((2/3)^2 = 4/9\). Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64.
\]

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(G\) is the centroid, it divides the median \(BE\) into a ratio of 2:1. This means that \(BG:GE = 2:1\). The line \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), so triangle \(EGN\) is similar to triangle \(BGC\) with a similarity ratio of \(1/3\) (since \(G\) divides \(BE\) in the ratio 2:1 and \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\)).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of triangle \(EGN\) to triangle \(BGC\) is \((1/3)^2 = 1/9\). The area of triangle \(BGC\) is one-third of the area of triangle \(ABC\) because the centroid divides the triangle into three triangles of equal area. Thus, the area of triangle \(BGC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle BGC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48.

4. Calculate the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books.

Let's start with the initial number of books on each shelf:
- The top shelf has 8 books of mystery.
- The middle shelf has 10 books of mathematics.
- The bottom shelf has 6 books of science.

The total number of books initially is:
\[ 8 + 10 + 6 = 24 \]

The number of mathematics books left is 8. Therefore, the fraction of the remaining books that are mathematics books is:

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since the digits of the number are all zeros and ones, the number must end in at least two zeros to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must be of the form \(111\ldots1100\).

Next, we need to check if \(111\ldots1100\) can satisfy the other factors. The number \(111\ldots1100\) can be written as \(111\ldots11 \times 100\). The number \(100\) already provides the factor of \(2^2\) (which includes one factor of 2), so we only need to ensure that \(111\ldots11\) provides at least one factor of 2 and two factors of 3.

Since \(111\ldots11\) is a number consisting only of ones, it is odd and therefore does not provide any factors of 2. However, we can check if it provides at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of \(111\ldots11\) is simply the number of ones in the number. We need to find the smallest number of ones such that their sum is divisible by 3. The smallest such number is 3, because \(1 + 1 + 1 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.

Next, we need to determine the probability that a piece is placed on a shaded square. The damas board has 8 squares in total, and 4 of them are shaded. Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen square is shaded is:
\[
\frac{4}{8} = \frac{1}{2}

Since the spin of the roda is independent for each spin, the probability that a piece is placed on a shaded square is the same as the probability that a randomly chosen square is shaded. Thus, the probability that the piece is placed on a shaded square is:

"To find the sum of the digits in the decimal representation of the fraction \(\frac{4321}{5^7 \cdot 2^8}\), we first simplify the denominator. The denominator is \(5^7 \cdot 2^8 = 5^7 \cdot 2^7 \cdot 2 = (5 \cdot 2)^7 \cdot 2 = 10^7 \cdot 2 = 20000000\). Therefore, the fraction becomes:

\[

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[
\frac{4321}{20000000} = 0.00021605

Now, we sum the digits of the decimal \(0.00021605\). The digits are \(0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 6, 0, 5\). Adding these digits together, we get:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

"To determine the form described by the equation \( z = c \) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand the meaning of each coordinate in cylindrical coordinates.

In cylindrical coordinates:

- \( \theta \) represents the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane, measured from the positive \( x \)-axis.
- \( z \) represents the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the equation \( z = c \) describes a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

"To find the smallest angle \(\theta\) between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the magnitudes into the cross product formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by recalling the properties of polynomial functions and their roots. Specifically, if a polynomial \( f(x) \) has roots \( r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_n \), then the polynomial \( f(x + c) \) has roots \( r_1 - c, r_2 - c, \ldots, r_n - c \). This means that the sum of the roots of \( f(x + c) \) is the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) minus \( c \) times the number of roots.

First, we need to find the sum of the roots of the original polynomial \( f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015 \). According to Vieta's formulas, for a cubic polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \), the sum of the roots is given by \( -\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n} \). Here, \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -49 \), so the sum of the roots of \( f(x) \) is:
\[
-\frac{-49}{1} = 49
\]

Next, we consider the polynomial \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \). The roots of \( g(x) \) are the roots of \( f(x) \) shifted by 5 units to the left. Therefore, if the roots of \( f(x) \) are \( r_1, r_2, r_3 \), then the roots of \( g(x) \) are \( r_1 - 5, r_2 - 5, r_3 - 5 \). The sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is:
\[
(r_1 - 5) + (r_2 - 5) + (r_3 - 5) = r_1 + r_2 + r_3 - 3 \cdot 5 = 49 - 15 = 34

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[

\]

We use the identity \(\tan^2 x + \cot^2 x = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos^2 x} + \frac{\cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x} = \frac{\sin^4 x + \cos^4 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{(\sin^2 x + \cos^2 x)^2 - 2\sin^2 x \cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - 2\sin^2 x \cos^2 x}{\sin^2 x \cos^2 x} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{2}\sin^2 2x}{\frac{1}{4}\sin^2 2x} = \frac{4 - 2\sin^2 2x}{\sin^2 2x} = \frac{4}{\sin^2 2x} - 2.
\]

For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{4}{\sin^2 40^\circ} - 2.
\]

Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{4}{\sin^2 40^\circ} - 2.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of internal angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the internal angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all internal angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all internal angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the sum of all internal angles \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of internal angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for the missing angle:**
   Since the polygon is convex, each internal angle must be less than \(180^\circ\). Therefore, the missing angle must satisfy:
   \[
   0^\circ < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Set up the inequality for the sum of all internal angles:**
   Adding the missing angle to both sides of the equation \(S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ\), we get:
   \[
   1070^\circ < S < 1070^\circ + 180^\circ
   \]
   Simplifying this, we have:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Solve the inequality for \(n\):**
   First, divide all parts of the inequality by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}

7. **Isolate \(n\):**
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444

8. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value for \(n\) is:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}. \]
This simplifies to:
\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}. \]
We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we get:
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}. \]
Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:
\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}. \]
We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):
\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23}, \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}, \]
so \( x = 5 \) is a solution. Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). This gives us two possible solutions for \( t \):
\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4, \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6. \]
Since \( t \) must be an odd integer between 0 and 23, we discard \( t = 4 \) and \( t = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

To verify, we check that \( t+2 = 19 \) is the inverse of \( t = 17 \) modulo 23:
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323. \]
Since \( 323 \div 23 = 14 \) with a remainder of 1, we have:
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \]
so \( 19 \) is indeed the inverse of \( 17 \) modulo 23. Thus, the solution is correct.","[17, '17']",17,"[17, '17']",True

"To find the distance between the two parallel lines given by the parametric equations

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} + t \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}
\]
and
\[
\begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},
\]

we first note that the direction vectors of the lines are \(\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\). Since \(\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix} = 2 \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}\), the lines are indeed parallel.

The distance between two parallel lines can be found by determining the perpendicular distance from a point on one line to the other line. We can use the point \(\begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\) on the first line and find the perpendicular distance to the second line.

The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \(\mathbf{a}\) to a line \(\mathbf{r} = \mathbf{b} + s\mathbf{c}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\|}{\|\mathbf{c}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix}\).

First, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -7 \\ -5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Next, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 8 & -7 & -5 \\ 4 & -18 & -4 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}((-7)(-4) - (-5)(-18)) - \mathbf{j}((8)(-4) - (-5)(4)) + \mathbf{k}((8)(-18) - (-7)(4)).
\]

Simplifying the components, we get:

\[
\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \mathbf{i}(28 - 90) - \mathbf{j}(-32 + 20) + \mathbf{k}(-144 + 28) = \mathbf{i}(-62) - \mathbf{j}(-12) + \mathbf{k}(-116) = \begin{pmatrix} -62 \\ 12 \\ -116 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\| = \sqrt{(-62)^2 + 12^2 + (-116)^2} = \sqrt{3844 + 144 + 13456} = \sqrt{17444} = 2\sqrt{4361}.
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{c}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{c}\| = \sqrt{4^2 + (-18)^2 + (-4)^2} = \sqrt{16 + 324 + 16} = \sqrt{356} = 2\sqrt{89}.
\]

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{a} - \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\|}{\|\mathbf{c}\|} = \frac{2\sqrt{4361}}{2\sqrt{89}} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.
\]

"To determine the number of points with integer coordinates that lie strictly within the rectangle with vertices \((5,4)\), \((-5,4)\), \((-5,-4)\), and \((5,-4)\), we need to consider the range of \(x\) and \(y\) values that are inside the rectangle but not on its boundary.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[
-5 < x < 5
\]
This gives us the integer values for \(x\) as:
\[
-4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
\]
There are 9 possible integer values for \(x\).

The \(y\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:

This gives us the integer values for \(y\) as:
\[
-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3
\]
There are 7 possible integer values for \(y\).

To find the total number of points with integer coordinates inside the rectangle, we multiply the number of possible integer values for \(x\) by the number of possible integer values for \(y\):

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.
\]

Applying this property, we have:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) - \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}).
\]

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We are given the values of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\), \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}\), and \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}\):

\[
\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we perform the scalar multiplications:

\[
6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
2 \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix},
\]

\[
-3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we add these vectors together:

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\):
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{AD}{BC} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Let \([\triangle ACD] = x\) and \([\triangle ABC] = y\). Then we have:
\[
x + y = 42 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{x}{y} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
From the Angle Bisector Theorem, we know:
\[
\frac{a}{b} = \frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{\frac{ab}{c}}{a} = \frac{b}{c}
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{c}
\]

We also know from the area of the trapezoid:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]
Since \(AB = \frac{ab}{c}\), we can substitute \(AB\) in the area formula:
\[
\left(\frac{ab}{c} + b\right) \times c = 84 \implies ab + bc = 84 \implies b(a + c) = 84
\]

Now, we need to find the ratio \(\frac{a}{b}\). From the area ratio:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{b}{c} \implies x = y \cdot \frac{b}{c}
\]

Substitute \(x\) in the total area equation:
\[
y \cdot \frac{b}{c} + y = 42 \implies y \left(\frac{b}{c} + 1\right) = 42
\]

We know \(b(a + c) = 84\), so:
\[
\frac{b}{c} = \frac{84}{b(a + c)} = \frac{84}{b \cdot b} = \frac{84}{b^2}
\]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b}{c} + 1\right) = y \left(\frac{b}{c} + \frac{c}{c}\right) = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = 42
\]

Since \(b(a + c) = 84\), we have:
\[
\frac{b + c}{c} = \frac{84}{b(a + c)} = \frac{84}{b \cdot b} = \frac{84}{b^2}
\]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\right) = 42
\]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c}\) = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = 42 \]

Thus:
\[
y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = y \left(\frac{b + c}{c} = 42 \]

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:
   \[
   \left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
   \]

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9
   \]

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:
   \[
   8x - 27x = -9
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   -19x = -9
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)** by dividing both sides by \(-19\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-9}{-19}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   x = \frac{9}{19}
   \]

5. **Verify the solution** by substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{2 \cdot \frac{9}{19}}}{\sqrt{3 \cdot \frac{9}{19} - 1}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - 1}}
   \]
   Simplify inside the square roots:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{19} \cdot \frac{19}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{18}{8}} = \sqrt{\frac{9}{4}} = \frac{3}{2}
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) is indeed a solution.

Therefore, the solution is:

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \( m = 7 \), \( n = 30 \), \( p = 10 \), and \( q = 21 \). Substituting these values into the operation, we get:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \( m \) and \( p \):

\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the multiplication by canceling out the common factor between 70 and 30. The greatest common divisor of 70 and 30 is 10. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
70 \cdot \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \cdot 21}{30} = \frac{7 \cdot 10 \cdot 21}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{7 \cdot 21}{3}
\]

Now, we simplify \(\frac{7 \cdot 21}{3}\). The greatest common divisor of 21 and 3 is 3. Therefore, we can rewrite the expression as:

\[
\frac{7 \cdot 21}{3} = \frac{7 \cdot 7 \cdot 3}{3} = 7 \cdot 7 = 49
\]

Thus, the value simplified of \(\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21}\) is:

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points on a circle. However, since the circle is symmetric, we need to divide by 4 (for rotations) and by 2 (for reflections). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements of 4 points on a circle is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   But this is incorrect because we are not considering the specific order of the points relative to each other. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This gives us:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]
   However, we need to consider the order of the segments, so we need to divide by 2 again:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   This is still incorrect. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This gives us:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{2!2!} = 6
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points must be arranged in one of the following two ways: \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, there are 2 favorable arrangements.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Therefore, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to determine the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

According to the problem, the total area of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to find the areas of the shaded regions in the smaller and larger circles separately.

### Area of the shaded region in the smaller circle
The smaller circle has a radius of 1. The area of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times (1)^2 = \pi
\]

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the smaller circle corresponding to \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides of length 1 (the radii) and an included angle \(\theta\):
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

The shaded area in the smaller circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle:
\[
\text{Shaded area in the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

### Area of the shaded region in the larger circle
The larger circle has a radius of 2. The area of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = 4\pi
\]

The area of the sector of the larger circle corresponding to \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{4\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle can be found using the formula for the area of a triangle with two sides of length 2 (the radii) and an included angle \(\theta\):
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2 \sin(\theta)
\]

The shaded area in the larger circle is the area of the sector minus the area of the triangle:
\[
\text{Shaded area in the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi - 2 \sin(\theta)
\]

### Total shaded area
The total shaded area is the sum of the shaded areas in the smaller and larger circles:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \left( \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) \right) + \left( \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi - 2 \sin(\theta) \right)
\]

Simplify the expression:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi + \frac{\theta}{90^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) - 2 \sin(\theta)
\]

Convert \(\frac{\theta}{90^\circ}\) to a fraction with a common denominator:
\[
\frac{\theta}{90^\circ} = \frac{4\theta}{360^\circ}
\]

Substitute back into the equation:
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi + \frac{4\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) - 2 \sin(\theta)
\]

Combine the terms involving \(\pi\):
\[
\text{Total shaded area} = \frac{5\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin(\theta)
\]

Set the total shaded area equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{5}{2} \sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \pi - \frac{1}{2} \sin(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 360:
\[
\theta \pi - 180 \sin(\theta) = 120 \pi
\]

Subtract \(\theta \pi\) from both sides:
\[
-180 \sin(\theta) = 120 \pi - \theta \pi
\]

Factor out \(\pi\) on the right-hand side:
\[
-180 \sin(\theta) = \pi (120 - \theta)
\]

Divide both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
-180 \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\pi} = 120 - \theta
\]

Rearrange to solve for \(\theta\):
\[
\theta = 120 + 180 \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\pi}
\]

By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(\theta = 60^\circ\) satisfies the equation. Therefore, the measure of the (menor) angle \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\boxed{60}

"To determine how many cylindrical beakers are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylinder and the sphere and then find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical beaker. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical beaker, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical beakers are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the sphere by the volume of the cylinder:
\[ \text{Number of beakers} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4 \]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical beakers needed to fill the spherical tank is:
\[ \boxed{4} \]","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Similarly, for \(\beta\):
\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) back into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"To convert the speed of the bicycle from feet per minute to polegadas per second, we need to follow these steps:

1. Convert feet per minute to feet per second.
2. Convert feet per second to polegadas per second.

**Step 1: Convert feet per minute to feet per second.**

There are 60 seconds in a minute. Therefore, to convert feet per minute to feet per second, we divide by 60.

\[ 20 \text{ feet per minute} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ feet per second} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet per second} \]

**Step 2: Convert feet per second to polegadas per second.**

There are 12 polegadas in a foot. Therefore, to convert feet per second to polegadas per second, we multiply by 12.

\[ \frac{1}{3} \text{ feet per second} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 \text{ polegadas per second} = 4 \text{ polegadas per second} \]

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 republicans and 6 democrats, with the condition that the subcomittee must include at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcomittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcomittee consisting only of republicans or only of democrats).

First, we calculate the total number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members from the 14 members of the committee. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection. Here, \(n = 14\) and \(k = 5\):

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcomittee consisting only of republicans. There are 8 republicans, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcomittee consisting only of democrats. There are 6 democrats, and we need to choose 5 of them:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of ways to form a subcomittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcomittee consisting only of republicans or only of democrats) is the sum of the two cases above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of ways to form a subcomittee that does not meet the condition from the total number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcomittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Let's apply the formula step by step.

1. Calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

2. Calculate \(a + b\):
\[

3. Substitute \(a - b\) and \(a + b\) into the difference of squares formula:
\[

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). According to the problem, the product of these three integers is 120. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

We are also given that the product of these three integers divided by their average is 24. The average of the three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

So, the equation for the division is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side of the equation, we get:

\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten using the difference of squares:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides of the equation, we get:

\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

We need to check both cases to determine the three consecutive integers.

**Case 1: \( n = 5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \). The product of these integers is:

\[
4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120
\]

The average of these integers is:

\[
\frac{4 + 5 + 6}{3} = 5
\]

Dividing the product by the average, we get:

\[
\frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

This satisfies the given condition. Therefore, the three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \), and the largest number is \( 6 \).

**Case 2: \( n = -5 \)**

The three consecutive integers are \( -6, -5, \) and \( -4 \). The product of these integers is:

\[
-6 \cdot -5 \cdot -4 = -120
\]

This does not satisfy the given condition that the product is 120. Therefore, this case is not valid.

The only valid solution is from Case 1, where the largest of the three consecutive integers is \( 6 \).

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root. We do this by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we take \(x = 66\).

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\). However, we only need the product of four specific cosines. To proceed, we use the fact that:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

We know from the double-angle identity that \(\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \cdot 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{-1}{32 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the product directly using the specific identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. The correct approach is to use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression directly:

\[

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
BC^2 = AB^2 + AC^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AC \cdot \cos \angle BAC = 2AB^2 (1 - \cos \theta)
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we substitute \(AB = AC = x\) into the equation:
\[
BC^2 = 2x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)
\]
Substituting \(BC^2 = 2x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)\) into the equation for \(BD^2\), we get:
\[
BD^2 = \frac{2x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)}{4} + 1 + x \cos 3\theta = \frac{x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)}{2} + 1 + x \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\). Therefore:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = \frac{x^2 (1 - \cos \theta)}{2} + 1 + x \cos 3\theta
\]
By solving this equation, we find that \(\cos \theta = \frac{3}{5}\). Therefore, \(\sin \theta = \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)^2} = \frac{4}{5}\).

Now, we find \(BC\):
\[
BC^2 = 2x^2 \left(1 - \frac{3}{5}\right) = 2x^2 \left(\frac{2}{5}\right) = \frac{4x^2}{5} \implies BC = \frac{2x}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5}
\]
The perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = x + x + \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2x + \frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5} = 2x \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{5}}{5}\right) = 2x \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{5}\right)
\]
Since \(AM = 11\) and \(AM\) is the altitude, we use the Pythagorean theorem in \(\triangle ABM\):
\[
AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 \implies x^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{\frac{2x \sqrt{5}}{5}}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{x \sqrt{5}}{5}\right)^2 = 121 + \frac{5x^2}{25} = 121 + \frac{x^2}{5}
\]
Multiplying through by 5, we get:
\[
5x^2 = 605 + x^2 \implies 4x^2 = 605 \implies x^2 = \frac{605}{4} \implies x = \frac{\sqrt{605}}{2} = \frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}
\]
Therefore, the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
2x \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{5}\right) = 2 \left(\frac{11\sqrt{5}}{2}\right) \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{5}\right) = 11\sqrt{5} \left(\frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{5}\right) = 11 \left(\sqrt{5} \cdot \frac{5 + \sqrt{5}}{5}\right) = 11 \left(\frac{5\sqrt{5} + 5}{5}\right) = 11 (\sqrt{5} + 1) = 11\sqrt{5} + 11

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, so the sum is:
\[
27 \times \left(a + \frac{26}{2}\right) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that the sum is \(3^7\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4
\]
Since \(3^4 = 81\), we have:
\[
a + 13 = 81

Subtracting 13 from both sides, we find:
\[
a = 68

The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence. The 14th number is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we need to break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\). So, this part of the inequality does not restrict the values of \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \sqrt{3}\) or \(x = -\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which is equivalent to:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions from both parts of the inequality, we find that the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:

\[

\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.

Adding 72 to both sides, we get:

so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[

"To determine which series has the number of bus passengers for male students closest to \(135\%\) of the number of bus passengers for female students, we need to calculate the ratio of the percentage of male passengers to the percentage of female passengers for each series and compare it to \(1.35\).

Let's go through each series step by step:

1. **9th series:**
   - Percentage of male passengers: \(41.1\%\)
   - Percentage of female passengers: \(39.4\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{41.1}{39.4} \approx 1.0427\)

2. **10th series:**
   - Percentage of male passengers: \(34.4\%\)
   - Percentage of female passengers: \(33.1\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{34.4}{33.1} \approx 1.0393\)

3. **11th series:**
   - Percentage of male passengers: \(20.6\%\)
   - Percentage of female passengers: \(13.8\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{20.6}{13.8} \approx 1.4855\)

4. **12th series:**
   - Percentage of male passengers: \(11.6\%\)
   - Percentage of female passengers: \(8.6\%\)
   - Ratio: \(\frac{11.6}{8.6} \approx 1.3488\)

Now, we compare each ratio to \(1.35\):

- **9th series:** \(1.0427\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.0427 = 0.3073\))
- **10th series:** \(1.0393\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.0393 = 0.3107\))
- **11th series:** \(1.4855\) (difference: \(1.4855 - 1.35 = 0.1355\))
- **12th series:** \(1.3488\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.3488 = 0.0012\))

The smallest difference is \(0.0012\), which corresponds to the 12th series.

Therefore, the series where the number of bus passengers for male students is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of bus passengers for female students is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative. Thus, the fraction is negative in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is positive, the denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive. Thus, the fraction is positive in this interval.

From the analysis above, the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) is negative in the intervals \((-9, 0)\) and \((9, 36)\). Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[\boxed{(-9, 0) \cup (9, 36)}.\]","[Union(Interval.open(-9, 0), Interval.open(9, 36)), '(-9, 0) \\cup (9, 36)']","(0,9) \cup (9,36)",[],False
"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by defining the variables. Let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) and the width be \( W \). The pista consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends. The radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the pista is given as 400 meters. This length includes the two straight sides of the rectangle and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \frac{\pi W}{2} \). Therefore, the total length of the pista is:
\[
L + L + \frac{\pi W}{2} + \frac{\pi W}{2} = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know this total length is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
\pi W = 200 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]
Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}
\]
Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:
\[
\boxed{\frac{20000}{\pi}}

"To find the value of \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by analyzing the given information and the properties of the triangle.

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}
\]

Given \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and \(RT = 5\), we can find \(ST\):
\[
\frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
\[
ST = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(ST\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). Recall the definition of the sine function for \(\angle T\):
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{RS}{RT}
\]

Substitute the known values:
\[
\sin{T} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Thus, the value of \(\sin{T}\) is:

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of the function \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{5}{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]

\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]

"To solve for the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron, we start by noting the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 faces, all of which are equilateral triangles. The vertices can be placed in a coordinate system such that the octahedron is symmetric about the origin.

Let's place the vertices of the octahedron as follows:
- \( A = (1, 0, 0) \)
- \( B = (-1, 0, 0) \)
- \( C = (0, 1, 0) \)
- \( D = (0, -1, 0) \)
- \( E = (0, 0, 1) \)
- \( F = (0, 0, -1) \)

We are given the distances from point \( P \) to five of these vertices:
- \( PA = 3 \)
- \( PB = 7 \)
- \( PC = 8 \)
- \( PD = 9 \)
- \( PE = 11 \)

We need to find the distance \( PF \).

First, we use the distance formula in three dimensions:
\[
d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2 + (z_2 - z_1)^2}
\]

Let the coordinates of point \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \).

Using the given distances, we set up the following equations:
1. \( PA = 3 \)
\[
\sqrt{(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9
\]

2. \( PB = 7 \)
\[
\sqrt{(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 7
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49
\]

3. \( PC = 8 \)
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2} = 8
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64
\]

4. \( PD = 9 \)
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2} = 9
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81
\]

5. \( PE = 11 \)
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2} = 11
\]
Squaring both sides:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121
\]

We now have a system of five equations:
\[
\begin{cases}
(x - 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9 \\
(x + 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 49 \\
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 + z^2 = 64 \\
x^2 + (y + 1)^2 + z^2 = 81 \\
x^2 + y^2 + (z - 1)^2 = 121
\end{cases}
\]

We subtract the first equation from the second:
\[
(x + 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 49 - 9
\]
\[
(x^2 + 2x + 1) - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 40
\]
\[
4x = 40
\]
\[
x = 10
\]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the third:
\[
x^2 + (y - 1)^2 - (x - 1)^2 = 64 - 9
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 - 2y + 1 - (x^2 - 2x + 1) = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2x = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 2(10) = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y + 20 = 55
\]
\[
y^2 - 2y - 35 = 0
\]

Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \):
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 140}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm \sqrt{144}}{2}
\]
\[
y = \frac{2 \pm 12}{2}
\]
\[
y = 7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = -5
\]

We substitute \( x = 10 \) and \( y = 7 \) into the first equation to find \( z \):
\[
(10 - 1)^2 + 7^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
81 + 49 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
130 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
z^2 = -121
\]
This is not possible since \( z^2 \) cannot be negative.

Thus, we use \( y = -5 \):
\[
(10 - 1)^2 + (-5)^2 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
81 + 25 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
106 + z^2 = 9
\]
\[
z^2 = -106
\]
This is also not possible.

Thus, we recheck calculations and find correct values.

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's beiseball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force applied to an object is equal to its mass times its acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Jen wants to launch her softball with the same force as Jack launches his beiseball. Therefore, the forces applied to both balls are equal. Let's denote the force by \( F \), the mass of Jen's softball by \( m_J = 200 \) g, and the mass of Jack's beiseball by \( m_B = 150 \) g. The accelerations of Jen's softball and Jack's beiseball are \( a_J \) and \( a_B \), respectively. According to Newton's second law, we can write:

\[ F = m_J \cdot a_J \]
\[ F = m_B \cdot a_B \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_B \cdot a_B \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_B \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's beiseball, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_B} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_B} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify the fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_B} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to Jack's beiseball is:

\[ \boxed{\frac{3}{4}} \]","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",\frac 34,"[34, '34']",False
"To determine how many of the same digits are found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
12 \div 7 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
1 \div 7 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 7 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. There are 3 common digits.

Therefore, the number of same digits found in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\) is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred in the meeting, we need to consider the interactions between the bruxas and the feiticeiros. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of bruxas and feiticeiros:**
   - There are 6 bruxas.
   - There are 10 feiticeiros.

2. **Determine the handshakes between bruxas and feiticeiros:**
   - Each bruxa apertar as mãos de each feiticeiro.
   - Therefore, each bruxa performs \(10\) handshakes (one with each feiticeiro).

3. **Calculate the total number of handshakes performed by all bruxas:**
   - Since there are 6 bruxas, and each performs 10 handshakes, the total number of handshakes is:
     \[
     6 \times 10 = 60

4. **Consider the handshakes among the feiticeiros:**
   - The problem states that none of the feiticeiros apertar as mãos de outros feiticeiros.
   - Therefore, there are no handshakes among the feiticeiros.

5. **Sum the total number of handshakes:**
   - The only handshakes that occurred are between the bruxas and the feiticeiros, which is 60.

Thus, the total number of handshakes that occurred in the meeting is \(\boxed{60}\).","[60, '60']",60,"[60, '60']",True
"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the minimum distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). By subtracting \(2x\) from both sides, we get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = -2\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = 2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we have:

\[
d = \frac{|-2(6) + 1(0) + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|-10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Now, we need to find the values of \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2\), \(t = 1 + i\), and \(t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one铅笔, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one铅笔 in dollars.
- Let \( b \) be the cost of one borachon in dollars.

We are given two equations based on the problem statement:
1. \( 3p + b = 1.24 \)
2. \( 5p + b = 1.82 \)

To eliminate \( b \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + b) - (3p + b) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]
Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
2p = 0.58
\]

Next, we solve for \( p \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2} = 0.29
\]

The cost of one铅笔 is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to centavos, we multiply by 100:

"To determine the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\), we start by converting the fraction into a decimal.

First, we simplify the fraction by performing the division:

\[
\frac{137}{500}
\]

We can convert this fraction into a decimal by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a power of 2 to make the denominator a power of 10. Since \(500 = 2^2 \times 5^3\), we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^1 = 2\):

\[
\frac{137 \times 2}{500 \times 2} = \frac{274}{1000}
\]

Now, we can write \(\frac{274}{1000}\) as a decimal:

\[
\frac{274}{1000} = 0.274
\]

In the decimal expansion \(0.274\), the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point is \(4\).

Thus, the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point in the decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(B\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(C\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(D\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2
\]

Expanding each inequality:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax - by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2 \implies ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

These inequalities describe a region inside the rectangle where the point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex. This region is a square with side length \(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}\) centered at the origin.

The area of the square is:
\[
(\sqrt{a^2 + b^2})^2 = a^2 + b^2
\]

The area of the rectangle is:
\[
2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the square to the area of the rectangle:
\[
\frac{a^2 + b^2}{4ab}
\]

Given that \(\frac{AB}{AD} = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2a}{2b} = k \implies \frac{a}{b} = k \implies a = kb
\]

Substituting \(a = kb\) into the probability expression:
\[
\frac{(kb)^2 + b^2}{4(kb)b} = \frac{k^2b^2 + b^2}{4k b^2} = \frac{b^2(k^2 + 1)}{4k b^2} = \frac{k^2 + 1}{4k}

First, we perform the division:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
The quotient is 9. Now, we can express 54 as:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money, in centavos, restou after converting the maximum amount of moedas into notes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money arrecadada by all four girls:**
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add these amounts step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total amount of money arrecadada is:
   \[
   126.59 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Convert the total amount into cents:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine the maximum amount of moedas that can be converted into notes:**
   The largest coin in the Gregorian currency system is the Susan B. Anthony coin, which is worth 25 cents. To find out how many Susan B. Anthony coins can be converted into notes, we divide the total amount of cents by 25:
   \[
   \left\lfloor \frac{12659}{25} \right\rfloor
   \]

   First, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{12659}{25} = 506.36
   \]

   The integer part of this division is 506, so the maximum number of Susan B. Anthony coins that can be converted into notes is 506.

4. **Calculate the total value of the moedas converted into notes:**
   Multiply the number of Susan B. Anthony coins by 25 cents:
   \[
   506 \times 25 = 12650 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Determine the amount of money left after converting the moedas:**
   Subtract the total value of the moedas converted into notes from the total amount of cents:
   \[
   12659 - 12650 = 9 \text{ cents}

"To find the average (arithmetic mean) of the test scores, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total sum of all the scores.
2. Divide the total sum by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total sum of the scores. We do this by multiplying the number of students who received each score by the score itself and then adding these products together.

The number of students who scored 80 is 20, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The number of students who scored 90 is 8, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The number of students who scored 100 is 2, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add these three amounts together to get the total sum of all the scores:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total sum by the number of students to find the average score. There are 30 students in the turma, so we divide 2520 by 30:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

"To solve for \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we can check the sums of the other rows, columns, and diagonals with \( n = 7 \).

The sum of the first row is:
\[

\]

The sum of the third row is:
\[
2 + 7 + (7-1) = 2 + 7 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the first column is:
\[
(7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]

The sum of the second column is:
\[
3 + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 7 = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15
\]

The sum of the third column is:
\[
(7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the main diagonal is:
\[
(7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

The sum of the other diagonal is:
\[
(7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

Since all the sums are equal to 15, our value of \( n = 7 \) is correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less that Martha caminha compared to Jim, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim caminha diagonalmente pelo campo, so we use the Pythagorean theorem. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The width of the field is 300 feet and the length of the field is 400 feet. Therefore, the distance Jim travels is:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\), which is the real root.

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.

Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
