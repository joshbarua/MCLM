"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians:**
   The rotation of a complex number \( z' \) by \( \theta \) radians is given by multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\theta} \). For \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \), we have:
   \[
   e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = \cos\frac{\pi}{4} + i\sin\frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Therefore, the rotated complex number \( z'' \) is:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying each term, we get:
   \[
   z'' = \frac{2}{2} + i\frac{2}{2} - i\frac{6}{2} + \frac{6}{2} = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) radians is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways 8 people can sit around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 people) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways 8 personer can sit runt ett runt bord if 3 av personerna -- Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas -- all vill sitta tillsammans is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(4)(6)(8) \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each term modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \quad \text{(since } 8 - 7 = 1\text{)}
\]

Now multiply these reduced terms together:

\[
(4)(6)(1) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}

Calculate the product:

\[

\]
\[

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[

"To determine the smallest number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is:

\[
\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
\]

However, we are interested in the angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position. A full rotation is \(360^\circ\), and since the pentagon has five sides, it will return to its original position after rotating by an angle that is a fraction of \(360^\circ\) corresponding to the number of sides. Specifically, the angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Therefore, the smallest number of degrees the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is:

"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) of the parallelogram with vertices \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), \((7, 4)\), and \((x, y)\), we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

First, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, let's find the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
6 + x = 12
\]
\[
x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
8 + y = 7
\]
\[
y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\). Therefore, we need to consider another pair of diagonals to find the correct coordinates.

Let's consider the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) and the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\).

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((x, y)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right)
\]

The midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((7, 4)\) is:
\[
\left( \frac{6+7}{2}, \frac{8+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

Setting these midpoints equal gives:
\[
\left( \frac{5+x}{2}, \frac{3+y}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{13}{2}, 6 \right)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{5+x}{2} = \frac{13}{2}
\]
\[
\frac{3+y}{2} = 6
\]

Solving the first equation for \(x\):
\[
5 + x = 13
\]
\[
x = 8
\]

Solving the second equation for \(y\):
\[
3 + y = 12
\]
\[
y = 9
\]

Since \(x = 8\) and \(x > 7\), these coordinates are valid. Therefore, the coordinates of the fourth vertex are \((8, 9)\).

Finally, we find \(x + y\):

x + y = 8 + 9 = 17

"Given a right triangle \(ABC\) with \(\angle B = 90^\circ\), we know that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). We need to find \(\tan A\).

\]
We are given that \(\sin A = 2\cos A\). Substituting this into the tangent formula, we get:

Since \(\cos A \neq 0\) (otherwise \(\sin A\) would also be zero, which is not possible for a non-zero angle in a right triangle), we can cancel \(\cos A\) in the numerator and the denominator:

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by the maximum value of the ratio \(\frac{\|A\mathbf{v}\|}{\|\mathbf{v}\|}\) over all non-zero vectors \(\mathbf{v}\).

First, let's express \(\|\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v}\|\) in terms of the components of \(\bold{v}\). If \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\), then

The norm of \(\mathbf{v}\) is
\[

\]
Setting \( g'(t) = 0 \), we get
\[
-12t^2 - 18t + 12 = 0 \implies 2t^2 + 3t - 2 = 0.

We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -2 \):
\[

This gives us two solutions: \( t = \frac{1}{2} \) and \( t = -2 \). We evaluate \( g(t) \) at these points and at the limits as \( t \to \pm \infty \):
\[

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

Finally, we recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x} = \cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"To determine how many treeks weigh the same as one squig, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- \( t \) = weight of one treek
- \( s \) = weight of one squig
- \( g \) = weight of one goolee

From the problem, we have the following two pieces of information:
1. A treek weighs as much as three squigs and one goolee.
2. Two treeks and one goolee weigh the same as one squig.

We can translate these statements into equations:
1. \( t = 3s + g \)
2. \( 2t + g = s \)

We need to eliminate \( g \) to find the relationship between \( t \) and \( s \). First, we can solve the second equation for \( g \):
\[ g = s - 2t \]

Next, we substitute this expression for \( g \) into the first equation:
\[ t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ t = 3s + s - 2t \]
\[ t = 4s - 2t \]

Now, we add \( 2t \) to both sides of the equation to isolate \( t \) on one side:
\[ 3t = 4s \]

Finally, we solve for \( t \) in terms of \( s \):
\[ t = \frac{4s}{3} \]

This tells us that one treek weighs the same as \(\frac{4}{3}\) squigs. To find out how many treeks weigh the same as one squig, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{4}{3}\):
\[ \text{Number of treeks} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the number of treeks that weigh the same as one squig is \(\boxed{\frac{3}{4}}\).","[3/4, '\\frac{3}{4}']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, we perform each multiplication:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by analyzing the given information. The tank is being filled with water at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, and the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. We need to find the radius \(r\) of the tank.

First, recall the formula for the volume \(V\) of a cylinder:
\[
V = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cylinder.

Since the tank is being filled at a rate of \(20\pi\) cubic meters per hour, we can express this as:
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi
\]

We are also given that the water level rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{dh}{dt} = 4
\]

To find the relationship between the rate of change of the volume and the rate of change of the height, we differentiate the volume formula with respect to time \(t\):
\[
\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt}
\]

Substitute the given values \(\frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi\) and \(\frac{dh}{dt} = 4\) into the equation:
\[
20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4
\]

Next, solve for \(r^2\):
\[
20\pi = 4\pi r^2
\]

Divide both sides by \(4\pi\):
\[
r^2 = \frac{20\pi}{4\pi} = 5

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(r\):
\[

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function in both pieces of its definition.

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x \geq 0\), which means the function only intersects the horizontal line \(y = 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and if \(a < 0\), the line is decreasing. If \(a = 0\), then \(f(x) = 0\) for all \(x < 0\), which means the function only intersects the horizontal line \(y = 0\).

To ensure that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to consider the range of the function. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function takes on all real values.

- For \(a > 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) takes on all values from \(a^3\) to \(\infty\). The line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) takes on all values from \(-\infty\) to \(a^2 + 2a\). For the function to intersect every horizontal line, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).
- For \(a < 0\), the parabola \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\) takes on all values from \(a^3\) to \(0\). The line \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\) takes on all values from \(a^2 + 2a\) to \(\infty\). For the function to intersect every horizontal line, we need \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\) and \(a^2 + 2a \leq 0\).
- For \(a = 0\), the function only intersects the horizontal line \(y = 0\).

Let's solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\):
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\]
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\]
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\]

The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the inequality holds:

- For \(a < -1\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) < 0\).
- For \(-1 \leq a < 0\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\).
- For \(0 \leq a < 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\).
- For \(a \geq 2\), \(a(a-2)(a+1) \geq 0\).

Next, we need to check the condition \(a^2 + 2a \leq 0\) for \(a < 0\):
\[a(a+2) \leq 0\]

The roots of the equation \(a(a+2) = 0\) are \(a = 0\) and \(a = -2\). We can use a sign chart to determine the intervals where the inequality holds:

- For \(a < -2\), \(a(a+2) > 0\).
- For \(-2 \leq a < 0\), \(a(a+2) \leq 0\).

Combining these results, we find that the function \(f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once if \(-2 \leq a \leq 2\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) such that \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
So, the solutions are:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) to be in the interval \([0,1]\), we need:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1.
\]
This inequality can be split into two parts:
\[
0 \leq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \implies \lambda - 1 \geq 0 \implies \lambda \geq 1,
\]
and
\[
\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} \leq 1 \implies \lambda - 1 \leq \lambda \implies -1 \leq 0,
\]
which is always true. Therefore, \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is in the interval \([0,1]\) if and only if \(\lambda \geq 1\).

Next, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). This means that \(x\) is a periodic point of period 2. We start by finding \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need \(f(f(x)) = x\), so:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
This equation can be rewritten as:
\[
x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
So, \(x = 0\) is a solution. For \(x \neq 0\), we have:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x - \lambda^3 x + 2\lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^4 x^3 - \lambda^4 x^2 - \lambda^2 x + \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda^2\), we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (\lambda^2 x^3 - \lambda^2 x^2 - x + \lambda) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
For \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) such that the equation has a solution. By analyzing the polynomial, we find that the polynomial has a root for \(\lambda = 2\). For \(\lambda = 2\), the equation becomes:
\[
2^2 (2^2 x^3 - 2^2 x^2 - x + 2) + 2^2 - 1 = 4 (4 x^3 - 4 x^2 - x + 2) + 4 - 1 = 16 x^3 - 16 x^2 - 4 x + 8 + 4 - 1 = 16 x^3 - 16 x^2 - 4 x + 11 = 0.
\]
By checking, we find that \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution. Therefore, \(\lambda = 2\) is a value for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\).

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately.

First, consider the numerator:
\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:
\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator becomes:
\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, consider the denominator:
\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]
We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:
\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]
Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:
\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]
We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator becomes:
\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:
\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:
\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos(45^\circ - 20^\circ) + \sin(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}{\sin(45^\circ - 20^\circ) - \cos(45^\circ - 40^\circ)}.

Using the tangent addition formula, we find that:
\[

Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the boundary conditions. If either \( x = 0 \) or \( y = 0 \), then the function simplifies to:
\[ f(x, 0) = x \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = x, \]
\[ f(0, y) = 0 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 0^2} = y. \]
The maximum value of \( x \) and \( y \) on the interval \([-1, 1]\) is 1. Therefore, the maximum value of \( f(x, 0) \) and \( f(0, y) \) is 1.

Next, let's consider the case when \( x = y \). Then the function becomes:
\[ f(x, x) = x \sqrt{1 - x^2} + x \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2}. \]
To find the maximum value of \( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \), we take the derivative with respect to \( x \) and set it to zero:
\[ \frac{d}{dx} \left( 2x \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right) = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} + 2x \cdot \frac{-x}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 2 \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2(1 - x^2) - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}. \]
Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ \frac{2 - 4x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 2 - 4x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
We evaluate \( f(x, x) \) at these critical points:
\[ f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1, \]
\[ f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right) = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \right)^2} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{2} = -1. \]
The maximum value of \( f(x, x) \) is 1.

Finally, we need to check if there are any other points inside the region \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \) that could give a value greater than 1. We use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le (x^2 + y^2)(1 - y^2 + 1 - x^2) = (x^2 + y^2)(2 - x^2 - y^2). \]
Let \( u = x^2 + y^2 \). Then \( 0 \le u \le 2 \), and the inequality becomes:
\[ (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le u(2 - u) = -u^2 + 2u. \]
The maximum value of the quadratic function \( -u^2 + 2u \) occurs at \( u = 1 \), and it is:
\[ -1^2 + 2 \cdot 1 = 1. \]
Therefore, \( (x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2})^2 \le 1 \), which implies:
\[ x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \le 1. \]

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle formed by two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\), which is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors. The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated as follows:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix}
\]

Expanding this determinant, we get:

\[

Simplifying each component, we have:

\[

"Given the equation \( z + \frac{1}{z} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \), we recognize that the right-hand side is the golden ratio, denoted by \(\phi\). Therefore, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = \phi. \]

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}. \]

Solving for \(\cos\theta\), we find:

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Therefore, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

We need to find \( z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} \). If \( z = e^{i\pi/5} \), then:

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since the line through \(G\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangles \(AMG\) and \(ABG\) are similar, and triangles \(ANG\) and \(ACG\) are similar. The similarity ratio between these triangles is the same as the ratio of the distances from the vertices to the centroid \(G\), which is \(2:3\).

This means that the height from \(A\) to \(MN\) is \(\frac{2}{3}\) of the height from \(A\) to \(BC\). Since the area of a triangle is proportional to the square of its height, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is \(\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 = \frac{4}{9}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\).

The area of triangle \(ABC\) is given as 144. Therefore, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:

This means that triangle \(EGN\) is similar to triangle \(BGC\) with a similarity ratio of \(2:3\).

The area of triangle \(BGC\) is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the area of triangle \(ABC\) because the centroid divides the triangle into three triangles of equal area. Therefore, the area of triangle \(BGC\) is:
\[

Since triangle \(EGN\) is similar to triangle \(BGC\) with a similarity ratio of \(2:3\), the area of triangle \(EGN\) is:

Let's start with the initial number of books on each bookshelf:
- The top bookshelf has 8 mystery books.
- The middle bookshelf has 10 math books.
- The bottom bookshelf has 6 science books.

The total number of books initially is:

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[4d = 300\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal, we need the denominator to be a power of 10. Since \(10 = 2 \cdot 5\), we need to have the same number of 2's and 5's in the denominator. The denominator \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\) has 2 factors of 2 and 7 factors of 5. To make the number of 2's equal to the number of 5's, we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) (which is \(32\)).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each wellers a number. Since there are 6 choices for Paul and 6 choices for Jesse, the total number of possible outcomes is:

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse wellers an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse wellers an odd number.

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it cannot contain the digit 2, 3, or 5 directly. However, we can use the properties of these digits to form a number that meets the criteria.

First, let's consider the factor of 5. A number that ends in 0 is divisible by 5. Since we can only use the digits 0 and 1, the number must end in 0. Additionally, to satisfy the factor of \(5^2 = 25\), the last two digits of the number must be 00. This is because a number that ends in 00 is divisible by 100, and thus also by 25.

Next, let's consider the factor of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the only digits we can use are 0 and 1, the sum of the digits will be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, we need the number of 1's to be a multiple of 3.

Combining these requirements, we need a number that ends in 00 and has a number of 1's that is a multiple of 3. The smallest such number is 11100. Let's verify:

- The sum of the digits of 11100 is \(1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.

"To find the value of \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ\), we start by using the identity \(\sin(180^\circ - x) = \sin x\). This allows us to rewrite the expression as follows:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

\[
\frac{3}{64} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256}.

"To determine the form described by the equation \(z = c\) in cylindrical coordinates \((r, \theta, z)\), we need to understand what this equation represents in the context of three-dimensional space.

In cylindrical coordinates, a point is represented as \((r, \theta, z)\), where:
- \(r\) is the radial distance from the \(z\)-axis,
- \(\theta\) is the angular coordinate in the \(xy\)-plane,
- \(z\) is the height above the \(xy\)-plane.

The equation \(z = c\) means that the height \(z\) is a constant value \(c\). This implies that for any point on the surface described by this equation, the \(z\)-coordinate is always \(c\), regardless of the values of \(r\) and \(\theta\).

In other words, the equation \(z = c\) describes a plane that is parallel to the \(xy\)-plane and intersects the \(z\)-axis at \(z = c\). This plane extends infinitely in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions, but it is fixed at a constant height \(c\) in the \(z\)-direction.

Therefore, the form described by the equation \(z = c\) is a plane.

"To find the smallest possible angle between the vectors \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\), we start by using the formula for the magnitude of the cross product of two vectors. The magnitude of the cross product \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\) is given by:

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \|\mathbf{a}\| \|\mathbf{b}\| \sin \theta
\]

where \(\theta\) is the angle between \(\mathbf{a}\) and \(\mathbf{b}\). We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7
\]

Now, we substitute the known values into the cross product magnitude formula:

\[
7 = 2 \cdot 7 \cdot \sin \theta
\]

Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:

\[
7 = 14 \sin \theta
\]

Solving for \(\sin \theta\), we divide both sides by 14:

\[
\sin \theta = \frac{7}{14} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by recalling the properties of polynomial functions and their roots. Specifically, the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\).

First, we need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):

\[
f(x) = x^3 - 49x^2 + 623x - 2015
\]

\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015
\]

Next, we expand each term in the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 3 \cdot x^2 \cdot 5 + 3 \cdot x \cdot 5^2 + 5^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125
\]

\[
49(x + 5)^2 = 49(x^2 + 2 \cdot x \cdot 5 + 5^2) = 49x^2 + 490x + 1225
\]

\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115
\]

Now, substitute these expanded forms back into the expression for \( g(x) \):

\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) - (49x^2 + 490x + 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
g(x) = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125 - 49x^2 - 490x - 1225 + 623x + 3115 - 2015

\[

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0

\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x

The polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \) is a cubic polynomial with the leading coefficient \( a_3 = 1 \) and the coefficient of \( x^2 \) is \( a_2 = -34 \). The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_2}{a_3}\):

"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

This implies that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3.
\]

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + 3 = 9.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all exterior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the sum of exterior angles of a polygon:**

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the sum of all exterior angles except one. According to the problem, \(S = 1070^\circ\).

3. **Find the measure of the missing exterior angle:**
   Since the total sum of all exterior angles is \(360^\circ\), the measure of the missing exterior angle \(E\) can be found by subtracting \(S\) from \(360^\circ\):
   \[
   E = 360^\circ - S

   Substituting the given value of \(S\):

"To find the unique integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. The inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that \( t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \). Here, \( x = t+2 \), so we have:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Plugging in these values, we have:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( y \) such that \( y^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \). We can do this by testing values of \( y \) from 1 to 11 (since \( y^2 \equiv (23-y)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[
\begin{aligned}
1^2 &\equiv 1 \pmod{23}, \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \pmod{23}, \\
3^2 &\equiv 9 \pmod{23}, \\

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since \( t \) must satisfy \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \).

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

**Step 1: Determine the side length of the cube.**

The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = \sqrt[3]{1} = 1 \]
So, the side length of the cube is 1 foot.

**Step 2: Calculate the area of one face of the cube.**

The area \( A \) of one face of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found, we get:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \]
So, the area of one face of the cube is 1 square foot.

**Step 3: Find the total surface area of the cube.**

A cube has 6 faces, so the total surface area \( S \) is:
\[ S = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \]
So, the total surface area of the cube is 6 square feet.

Therefore, the total surface area of the cube is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",864 \mbox{ inches}^2,"[864, '864']",True
"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to determine what the radical conjugate is. The radical conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply these two numbers together:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[

\[

The general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

In this problem, we need to find the 2003rd term (\(a_{2003}\)). Substituting \(a_1 = 1\), \(d = 2\), and \(n = 2003\) into the formula, we get:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

we can use the formula for the distance between two parallel lines. The distance \(d\) between two parallel lines \(\mathbf{r}_1 = \mathbf{a}_1 + t\mathbf{b}\) and \(\mathbf{r}_2 = \mathbf{a}_2 + u\mathbf{b}\) is given by

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|} = \frac{\sqrt{4361}}{\sqrt{89}} = \sqrt{\frac{4361}{89}} = \sqrt{49} = 7.

The \(x\)-coordinates of the vertices are \(-5\) and \(5\). Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of any point strictly inside the rectangle must satisfy:
\[

This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. The number of integer values in this range is:

"To determine the average price per frimárka for Juan's frimárken in the 1970s, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine the price per frimárka for each country.
3. Calculate the total cost for all frimárken in the 1970s.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of frimárken to find the average price.

Let's start with the number of frimárken for each country in the 1970s:

- Peru: 6
- Spain: 13

Next, we know the price per frimárka for each country:

- Peru: 4 cent
- Spain: 5 cent

Now, we calculate the total cost for each country:

- Total cost for Brazil: \(12 \times 6 = 72\) cents
- Total cost for France: \(15 \times 4 = 60\) cents
- Total cost for Peru: \(6 \times 4 = 24\) cents
- Total cost for Spain: \(13 \times 5 = 65\) cents

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with \(\angle ACD = 90^\circ\).

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AB\) and \(AD\) respectively. Let's denote the length of \(AC\) as \(d\). The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) can be expressed as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]
Since the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\), we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = 42
\]
Substituting the expressions for the areas of the triangles, we get:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = 42
\]
Factoring out \(\frac{1}{2} \times h\) from the left side, we obtain:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times h \times (a + b) = 42
\]
This equation is the same as the expression for the area of the trapezoid, confirming our setup. To find the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we need to express \(b\) in terms of \(a\) and \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{h}
\]
However, we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height for both triangles and it bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are proportional to their bases \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{a+b} \times 42
\]
Since \(a + b = \frac{2 \times 42}{h} = \frac{84}{h}\), we substitute this into the equation for the area of \(\triangle ACD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a}{\frac{84}{h}} \times 42 = \frac{a \times h}{84} \times 42 = \frac{a \times h \times 42}{84} = \frac{a \times h}{2}
\]
Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]
Since we already know that \(\frac{1}{2} \times a \times h\) is the area of \(\triangle ACD\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid minus the area of \(\triangle ABC\), which simplifies to:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 28

This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, the points must alternate between the two segments. For example, if the points are labeled in order as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\), the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence. However, since the points are on a circle, we need to account for the fact that rotating the points does not create a new arrangement. Therefore, we divide by 4 to account for these rotations. Additionally, we need to account for the fact that reversing the order of the points does not create a new arrangement (i.e., \(A, B, C, D\) is the same as \(D, C, B, A\)). Thus, we divide by 2. So, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   However, this is incorrect because we need to consider the specific condition of alternating points. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. There are \(\binom{4}{2} = 6\) ways to choose 2 points out of 4, but each pair of points can be arranged in 2 ways (either \(AB\) and \(CD\) or \(CD\) and \(AB\)). Therefore, the total number of distinct arrangements is:
   \[
   \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: As mentioned earlier, for the segments to intersect, the points must alternate. There are 2 favorable arrangements: \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\). Therefore, the number of favorable arrangements is 2.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}
   \]

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) skäres varandra is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To determine the measure of \(\angle ADC\), we start by calculating the areas of the circles and the skaded region. The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
According to the problem, the total area of the skaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the skaded region is:
\[
\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The skaded region consists of a sector of the smaller circle and a sector of the larger circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 1^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{360}
\]
The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\frac{\theta}{360} \times \pi \times 2^2 = \frac{\theta \pi}{90}
\]
The total area of the skaded region is the sum of these two areas:
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{\theta \pi}{90} = \frac{\theta \pi}{360} + \frac{4\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{5\theta \pi}{360} = \frac{\theta \pi}{72}
\]
We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{\theta \pi}{72} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
To solve for \(\theta\), we divide both sides of the equation by \(\pi\):
\[
\frac{\theta}{72} = \frac{5}{3}
\]
Next, we multiply both sides by 72:
\[
\theta = \frac{5}{3} \times 72 = 120
\]
Therefore, the measure of \(\angle ADC\) is:
\[
\boxed{120}

"To determine how many cylindrical barrels are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical barrel and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the barrel.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical barrel. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical barrel, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi (6)^3 = \frac{4}{3} \pi \cdot 216 = \frac{4 \cdot 216}{3} \pi = 288\pi \text{ cubic cm}
\]

Now, we need to find out how many cylindrical barrels are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the cylindrical barrel:
\[
\text{Number of barrels} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cylinder}}} = \frac{288\pi}{72\pi} = \frac{288}{72} = 4
\]

Therefore, the number of cylindrical barrels needed to fill the spherical tank is \(\boxed{4}\).","[4, '4']",4,"[4, '4']",True
"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we need to find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\). Since \(\sin^2 \alpha + \cos^2 \alpha = 1\), we have:
\[
\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84
\]
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{84}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}
\]

Similarly, for \(\beta\):
\[
\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75
\]
\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{75}{100}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) back into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100}
\]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 25 and 100 is 100, so we rewrite \(\frac{3}{25}\) as \(\frac{12}{100}\):
\[
\frac{3}{25} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12}{100} - \frac{21}{100} = \frac{12 - 21}{100} = \frac{-9}{100}
\]

Therefore, the value of the expression is:

"To convert the speed of the cycle from feet per minute to feet per second, we need to use the conversion factor that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. Here are the steps to perform the conversion:

1. Identify the given speed in feet per minute: 20 feet per minute.
2. Use the conversion factor to convert minutes to seconds: 1 minute = 60 seconds.
3. Set up the conversion as a fraction: \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{1 \text{ minute}} \times \frac{1 \text{ minute}}{60 \text{ seconds}} \).
4. Simplify the expression by canceling out the minutes: \( \frac{20 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ seconds}} \).

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 5 members from a sensekommitté consisting of 8 republikaner and 6 demokraters, such that there is at least one member from each party, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the requirement (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of republikaners or only of demokraters).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 people in the sensekommitté. This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

\[
\binom{14}{5} = \frac{14!}{5!(14-5)!} = \frac{14!}{5! \cdot 9!} = \frac{14 \times 13 \times 12 \times 11 \times 10}{5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1} = 2002
\]

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of republikaners. This is the number of ways to choose 5 republikaners from the 8 republikaners.

\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Then, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of demokraters. This is the number of ways to choose 5 demokraters from the 6 demokraters.

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

Now, subtract the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of republikaners and the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of demokraters from the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members.

\[
2002 - 56 - 6 = 1940

Therefore, the number of ways to form a subcommittee with 5 members who have at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[

First, we calculate \(513 - 487\):

\[
513 - 487 = 26

Next, we calculate \(513 + 487\):

\[
513 + 487 = 1000

Now, we multiply these two results together:

"Låt de tre consecutive integers be \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \). Dators product is given by:

\[
(n-1)n(n+1) = 120
\]

The average of these three integers is:

\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product of the three integers divided by their average is 24. Therefore, we have:

\[
\frac{(n-1)n(n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
(n-1)(n+1) = 24
\]

This can be rewritten as:

\[
n^2 - 1 = 24

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:

\[
n^2 = 25

Taking the square root of both sides, we get:

\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5

Since we are looking for the largest of the three consecutive integers, we consider the case where \( n = 5 \). The three consecutive integers are \( 4, 5, \) and \( 6 \). The largest of these integers is:

\[
6

To verify, we check the product and the average:

\[

\[

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square trinomial. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), we have:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked for the positive value of \(x\), we take \(x = 66\).

Therefore, the expression becomes:

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of this identity by noting that the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) are the non-zero roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) when \(x = \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{15} \right)\) for \(k = 1, 2, 4, 7\).

The product of the roots of the polynomial \(8x^4 - 8x^3 + 4x^2 - 2x + 1 = 0\) is given by \(\frac{1}{8}\) (by Vieta's formulas). Therefore, we have:

"Given that triangle \(ABC\) is isosceles with \(AB = AC\) and the altitude \(AM = 11\), we need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) given that there is a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) with \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Using the triple angle identity for sine, \(\sin 3\theta = 3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3\sin \theta - 4\sin^3 \theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \theta = 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{3 \cdot 2 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{\sin \frac{\theta}{2}}{6 \sin \frac{\theta}{2} \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^3 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 \sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2}}
\]
Since \(\sin^2 \frac{\theta}{2} = 1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}\), we substitute this into the equation:
\[
BD = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 (1 - \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2})} = \frac{1}{6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4 + 4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2}} = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}
\]
Now, we use the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle BDM\):
\[
BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos \angle BDM
\]
Since \(BM = \frac{BC}{2}\) and \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - 3\theta\), we have \(\cos \angle BDM = -\cos 3\theta\). Therefore:
\[
BD^2 = \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot \frac{BC}{2} \cdot 1 \cdot (-\cos 3\theta) = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
We also know that \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\), so:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{4 \cos^2 \frac{\theta}{2} + 6 \cos \frac{\theta}{2} - 4}\right)^2 = \frac{BC^2}{4} + 1 + BC \cos 3\theta
\]
Since \(BC = 2BM = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2}\), we substitute \(BC = 2 \sqrt{AB^2 - 121}\) into the equation. However, a simpler approach is to use the fact that \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\) and the properties of the triangle. By symmetry and trigonometric identities, we find that \(\theta = 30^\circ\).

Therefore, \(\angle BAC = 30^\circ\) and \(\angle BDC = 90^\circ\). In \(\triangle BDM\), \(\angle BDM = 90^\circ\), so \(BD = \sqrt{BM^2 - DM^2} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 - 1^2} = \sqrt{\left(\sqrt{AB^2 - 121}\right)^2 - 1} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 122}\).

Since \(BD = \frac{1}{4 \cos^2 15^\circ + 6 \cos 15^\circ - 4} = \frac{1}{4 \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\right)^2 + 6 \left(\frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4}\right) - 4} = \frac{1}{4 \cdot \frac{8 + 4\sqrt{3}}{16} + 6 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{6} + \sqrt{2}}{4} - 4} = \frac{1}{2 + \sqrt{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{6} + 3\sqrt{2}}{2} - 4} = \frac{1}{-2 + \sqrt{3} + \frac{3\sqrt{6} + 3\sqrt{2}}{2}} = \sqrt{2}\).

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \frac{n}{2} \times (\text{first term} + \text{last term})
\]
where \(n\) is the number of terms. In this problem, \(n = 27\), the first term is \(a\), and the last term is \(a + 26\). Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
\frac{27}{2} \times (a + (a + 26)) = \frac{27}{2} \times (2a + 26) = 27 \times (a + 13)
\]
We know that the sum of the sequence is \(3^7\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Since \(27 = 3^3\), we can rewrite the equation as:
\[
3^3 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
Dividing both sides by \(3^3\), we get:
\[
a + 13 = 3^4 = 81
\]
Solving for \(a\), we find:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence. The 14th number is:
\[
68 + 13 = 81
\]
Thus, the median of the sequence is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one individually.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\). So, this part of the inequality does not restrict the values of \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
To solve this, we first find the roots of the equation \(x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 = 0\). Let \(y = x^2\). Then the equation becomes a quadratic equation in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0.\]
We solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\):
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{4^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-21)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions for \(y\):
\[y = \frac{-4 + 10}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-4 - 10}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative solution \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(x^2 = 3\), which gives us \(x = \pm\sqrt{3}\).

The quadratic \(y^2 + 4y - 21\) factors as \((y + 7)(y - 3)\). Since \(y = x^2\), we have \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\). The factor \(x^2 + 7\) is always positive for all real numbers \(x\), so the inequality \((x^2 + 7)(x^2 - 3) < 0\) simplifies to \(x^2 - 3 < 0\), which gives us:
\[x^2 < 3.\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we get:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Combining the solutions from both parts of the inequality, we find that the solution to \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) is:
\[-\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}.\]

Therefore, the answer in interval notation is:

"Given the equations:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.
\]

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine for which year the number of male bus drivers is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus drivers, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of male bus drivers to the number of female bus drivers for each year and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of male and female bus drivers for each year. Since there are 300 men and 300 women in each year, the number of male bus drivers is the percentage of men who are bus drivers multiplied by 300, and the number of female bus drivers is the percentage of women who are bus drivers multiplied by 300.

For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) year:
- Number of male bus drivers: \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
- Number of female bus drivers: \(39.4\% \times 300 = 0.394 \times 300 = 118.2\)
- Ratio of male to female bus drivers: \(\frac{123.3}{118.2} \approx 1.04\)

For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) year:
- Number of male bus drivers: \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
- Number of female bus drivers: \(33.1\% \times 300 = 0.331 \times 300 = 99.3\)
- Ratio of male to female bus drivers: \(\frac{103.2}{99.3} \approx 1.04\)

For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) year:
- Number of male bus drivers: \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
- Number of female bus drivers: \(13.8\% \times 300 = 0.138 \times 300 = 41.4\)
- Ratio of male to female bus drivers: \(\frac{61.8}{41.4} \approx 1.5\)

For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) year:
- Number of male bus drivers: \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\)
- Number of female bus drivers: \(8.6\% \times 300 = 0.086 \times 300 = 25.8\)
- Ratio of male to female bus drivers: \(\frac{34.8}{25.8} \approx 1.35\)

Now, we compare the ratios to \(1.35\):
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) year: \(1.04\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.04 = 0.31\))
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) year: \(1.04\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.04 = 0.31\))
- For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) year: \(1.5\) (difference: \(1.5 - 1.35 = 0.15\))
- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) year: \(1.35\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.35 = 0\))

The ratio for the \(12^{\text{th}}\) year is exactly \(1.35\), so the number of male bus drivers is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female bus drivers in the \(12^{\text{th}}\) year.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

Combining the intervals where the inequality is satisfied, we get:

(0, 9) \cup (9, 36).

Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:
\[

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field, we start by analyzing the given information about the track. The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two half-circles. The total length of the track is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The two half-circles have a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle, which is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The circumference of a full circle with radius \( \frac{W}{2} \) is given by:
\[
2\pi \left(\frac{W}{2}\right) = \pi W
\]
Since there are two half-circles, the total length of the curved parts of the track is:
\[
2 \times \frac{\pi W}{2} = \pi W
\]

The total length of the track is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the two half-circles:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]

We need to express the area \( A \) of the rectangle in terms of one variable. The area \( A \) is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]

First, solve the perimeter equation for \( L \):
\[
2L = 400 - \pi W
\]
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]

Substitute this expression for \( L \) into the area formula:
\[
A = \left(\frac{400 - \pi W}{2}\right) W
\]
\[
A = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2}
\]
\[
A = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]

To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
\[
\pi W = 200
\]
\[
W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]

Next, substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2}
\]
\[
L = \frac{400 - 200}{2}
\]
\[
L = \frac{200}{2}
\]
\[
L = 100
\]

Now, calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = L \times W
\]
\[
A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
\[
A = \frac{20000}{\pi}

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- \(RT = 5\)

First, we use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
Here, the opposite side to \(\angle R\) is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:
\[
\frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
Since \(RT = 5\), we can solve for \(ST\):
\[
ST = \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(RS\):
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[
RS^2 = 21

Here, the opposite side to \(\angle T\) is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore:

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 6 - 6 = 24 \]
 So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root.

Finally, let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 6 - 6 = 24 \]

Finally, we find \( x = 6 \) is not correct.

"To solve the problem, we need to use the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, and each vertex is connected to 4 other vertices. The vertices can be divided into two sets of 3 vertices each, with each set forming an equilateral triangle, and the vertices in different sets are connected by edges of the same length.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \(A, B, C, D, E, F\) such that \(A, C, E\) are in one set and \(B, D, F\) are in the other set. The edges of the octahedron are all of the same length, say \(s\).

Given that the distances from point \(P\) to the vertices \(A, B, C, D, E\) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \(P\) to the vertex \(F\).

First, we use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. This constant can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a regular octahedron:

\[
\text{Sum of squares} = 4s^2 + 4d^2
\]

where \(d\) is the distance from the point to the center of the octahedron. However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the vertices of a cube with the same edge length \(s\).

The sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a cube with edge length \(s\) is given by:

\[
\text{Sum of squares} = 4s^2 + 4d^2
\]

where \(d\) is the distance from the point to the center of the cube. However, we can also use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point to the vertices of a regular octahedron is equal to the sum of the squares of the distances from the point to the vertices of a cube with the same edge length \(s\).

The sum of the squares of the distances from a point to the vertices of a cube with edge length \(s\) is given by:

\[
\text{Sum of squares} = 4s^2 + 4d^2
\]

where \(d\) is the distance from the point to the center of the cube.

Given the distances from \(P\) to the vertices \(A, B, C, D, E\) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we can calculate the sum of the squares of these distances:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 = 9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 = 324
\]

Let the distance from \(P\) to \(F\) be \(x\). Then the sum of the squares of the distances from \(P\) to all six vertices is:

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + x^2 = 324 + x^2
\]

Since the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant, we have:

\[
324 + x^2 = 4s^2 + 4d^2

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softboll to the acceleration of Jack's baseboll, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Since Jen wants to throw the softboll with the same force as Jack throws the baseboll, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{softboll}} = F_{\text{baseboll}} \]

Using Newton's second law for each ball, we get:

\[ m_{\text{softboll}} \cdot a_{\text{softboll}} = m_{\text{baseboll}} \cdot a_{\text{baseboll}} \]

We are given the masses of the balls:
- The mass of the softboll, \( m_{\text{softboll}} = 200 \) g
- The mass of the baseboll, \( m_{\text{baseboll}} = 150 \) g

Substituting these values into the equation, we have:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{softboll}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{baseboll}} \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the softboll to the acceleration of the baseboll, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{softboll}}}{a_{\text{baseboll}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{softboll}}}{a_{\text{baseboll}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

"To determine how many of the same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Counting these, we find there are 3 common digits.

"To determine the total number of handshakes at the party, we need to consider the handshakes between the Häxors and the trollkarlars. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of Häxors and trollkarlars:**
   - There are 6 Häxors.
   - There are 10 trollkarlars.

2. **Determine the handshakes between Häxors and trollkarlars:**
   - Each Häxor skakes hand with each trollkarlare.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes between Häxors and trollkarlars is calculated by multiplying the number of Häxors by the number of trollkarlars:
     \[
     6 \text{ Häxors} \times 10 \text{ trollkarlars} = 60 \text{ handshakes}

3. **Consider the handshakes among the Häxors:**
   - The problem states that no Häxor brylla himself or each other. Therefore, there are no handshakes among the Häxors.

4. **Consider the handshakes among the trollkarlars:**
   - The problem states that no trollkarlare skakes hand with another trollkarlare. Therefore, there are no handshakes among the trollkarlars.

5. **Calculate the total number of handshakes:**
   - Since there are no handshakes among the Häxors or among the trollkarlars, the total number of handshakes is simply the number of handshakes between Häxors and trollkarlars:

Next, we need to evaluate \( f(0) \) for the polynomial \( f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2 \). Substituting \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial, we get:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). By subtracting \(2x\) from both sides, we get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = -2\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = 2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we have:

\[
d = \frac{|-2(6) + 1(0) + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|-10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3).
\]

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\). The roots of this polynomial are \(t = -2, t = 1 + i, t = 1 - i\). Therefore, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"To determine the cost of one penna, we start by defining the variables:
- Let \( p \) be the cost of one penna in dollars.
- Let \( j \) be the cost of one jumbo suddgummi in dollars.

We are given two equations based on the problem statement:
1. Tre pennor och ett jumbo suddgummi costs \$1.24:
   \[
   3p + j = 1.24
   \]
2. Fem pennor och ett jumbo suddgummi costs \$1.82:
   \[
   5p + j = 1.82
   \]

To eliminate \( j \), we subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(5p + j) - (3p + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:
\[
5p - 3p = 0.58
\]
\[
2p = 0.58
\]

Next, we solve for \( p \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
p = \frac{0.58}{2}
\]
\[
p = 0.29
\]

The cost of one penna is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

\[

The decimal expansion of \(\frac{137}{500}\) is \(0.274\). To identify the last non-zero digit to the right of the decimal point, we look at the digits in the decimal expansion: \(2\), \(7\), and \(4\).

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \((x, y)\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \((x, y)\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x, y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
\sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we need to consider the distances to the other vertices:
1. To vertex \(B\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x - a)^2 + (y - b)^2

\[
0 < -2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]
\[
2ax + 2by < a^2 + b^2

\[

2. To vertex \(C\):
\[

\[
0 < -2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2

\[

3. To vertex \(D\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2}
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y + b)^2

\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2
\]
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 + 2by + b^2
\]
\[
-2ax - 2by < a^2 + b^2

\[
ax + by > -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Combining these inequalities, we get:
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} < ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}

These inequalities describe a region inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) that is symmetric about the center \(O\). The region is a square with side length \(a\sqrt{2}\) inscribed within the rectangle.

The area of the inscribed square is:
\[
(a\sqrt{2})^2 = 2a^2
\]

The area of the rectangle \(ABCD\) is:
\[
2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any of the vertices is the ratio of the area of the inscribed square to the area of the rectangle:
\[

First, we perform the division:
\[54 \div 6 = 9\]
The quotient is 9. Now, we can express 54 as:

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

"To determine how much money, in cents, was left after Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie(validated their money and exchanged as many tens as possible into seashells), we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money they earned:**
   - Linda: \$27.47
   - Sherry: \$35.23
   - June: \$37.37
   - Connie: \$26.52

   Adding these amounts together:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52
   \]

   Let's add them step by step:
   \[
   27.47 + 35.23 = 62.70
   \]
   \[
   62.70 + 37.37 = 100.07
   \]
   \[
   100.07 + 26.52 = 126.59
   \]

   So, the total amount of money they earned is:
   \[
   \$126.59
   \]

2. **Convert the total amount into cents:**
   Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the total amount by 100:
   \[
   126.59 \times 100 = 12659 \text{ cents}
   \]

3. **Determine how many tens can be exchanged into seashells:**
   To find out how many tens can be exchanged, we divide the total number of cents by 10:
   \[
   12659 \div 10 = 1265.9
   \]

   Since we can only exchange whole tens, we take the integer part of the division:
   \[
   1265 \text{ tens}

4. **Calculate the total value of the exchanged tens:**
   Each ten is worth 100 cents, so:
   \[
   1265 \times 100 = 126500 \text{ cents}
   \]

5. **Determine the remaining cents after exchanging the tens:**
   Subtract the total value of the exchanged tens from the total number of cents:

"To find the average score of the class, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total score of all the students.
2. Divide the total score by the number of students.

First, let's calculate the total score. We do this by multiplying the number of students who received each score by the score itself, and then summing these products.

The number of students who received 80 is 20, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 20 \times 80 = 1600 \]

The number of students who received 90 is 8, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 8 \times 90 = 720 \]

The number of students who received 100 is 2, so the total score for these students is:
\[ 2 \times 100 = 200 \]

Now, we add up all these scores to get the total score for the class:
\[ 1600 + 720 + 200 = 2520 \]

Next, we divide the total score by the number of students to find the average score. The number of students is 30, so the average score is:
\[ \frac{2520}{30} = 84 \]

"To determine the value of \( n \) in the given magic square, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals.

The magic square becomes:

4 & 3 & 8 \\
\hline
9 & 5 & 1 \\

Let's check the sum of each row:
- First row: \( 4 + 3 + 8 = 15 \)
- Second row: \( 9 + 5 + 1 = 15 \)
- Third row: \( 2 + 7 + 6 = 15 \)

- First column: \( 4 + 9 + 2 = 15 \)
- Second column: \( 3 + 5 + 7 = 15 \)
- Third column: \( 8 + 1 + 6 = 15 \)

Let's check the sum of the two main diagonals:
- Main diagonal: \( 4 + 5 + 6 = 15 \)
- Other diagonal: \( 8 + 5 + 2 = 15 \)

Since all the sums are equal to 15, the value of \( n \) is indeed correct. Therefore, the value of \( n \) is \(\boxed{7}\).","[7, '7']",7,"[7, '7']",True
"To determine how many feet less Jim goes than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference between these distances.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim goes diagonally over the rectangular field. The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. The formula is:

\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{\text{Length}^2 + \text{Width}^2} \]

For Jim's path, the length of the field is 400 feet and the width is 300 feet. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ \text{Diagonal} = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim travels 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha goes along the length and the width of the field. The total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Length} + \text{Width} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we need to find out how many feet less Jim goes than Martha. We do this by subtracting the distance Jim travels from the distance Martha travels:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Martha travels} - \text{Distance Jim travels} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

\[

\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.

For example, if \(AB = 1\), \(AC = 2\), \(AD = 3\), \(BC = 4\), \(BD = 5\), and \(CD = 6\), we would calculate each path and find that the shortest path is \(A \to B \to C \to D\) with a total distance of \(1 + 4 + 6 = 11\). Therefore, the answer would be \(\boxed{11}\).","[11, '11']",13,"[13, '13']",False
