"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:

"To find the result of rotating the complex number \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) around the complex number \( c = 2 - 3i \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Rotating a complex number by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) is equivalent to multiplying it by \( e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   We can expand this product using the distributive property:
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original coordinate system:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i
   \]

Thus, the result of rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) in the counterclockwise direction is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to seating 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a round table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units around a round table is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to seat the 8 people such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their unit. Therefore, the total number of ways is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to seat 8 people around a round table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3
\]
\[
= \binom{5}{3} 10^2 x^{6} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 x^{-6}

\[

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\):

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplify each term inside the parentheses:

\[
2 + 2 = 4
\]
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
2 + 6 = 8
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8 \pmod{7}
\]

Next, reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Thus, the expression simplifies to:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, multiply the numbers:

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24
\]

Finally, reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3

So,

\[

Therefore, the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To determine the minimum number of degrees that a regular pentagon must be rotated around its center to coincide with its original position, we need to consider the properties of rotational symmetry. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

A regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum of the interior angles is:
\[
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]
Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is:
\[
\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
\]
However, we are interested in the angles of rotation that will bring the pentagon back to its original position. A regular pentagon will look the same after being rotated by \(\frac{360^\circ}{5}\), which is the angle subtended by one side of the pentagon at the center. This angle is:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]
Therefore, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to coincide with its original position is \(\boxed{72}\).","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \) instead. The midpoint of \( AB \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

The midpoint of \( CD \) is:
\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The magnitude of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y.
\]

Rearranging these equations, we obtain

\[
(8 - 2\lambda)x + 12y = 0,
\]
\[
12x + (26 - 2\lambda)y = 0.
\]

This system can be written in matrix form as

\[
\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\ 12 & 26 - 2\lambda \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

For a non-trivial solution, the determinant of the coefficient matrix must be zero:

\[
\det\begin{pmatrix} 8 - 2\lambda & 12 \\ 12 & 26 - 2\lambda \end{pmatrix} = (8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - 12 \cdot 12 = 0.
\]

Expanding and simplifying, we get

\[
(8 - 2\lambda)(26 - 2\lambda) - 144 = 0,
\]
\[
208 - 16\lambda - 52\lambda + 4\lambda^2 - 144 = 0,
\]
\[
4\lambda^2 - 68\lambda + 64 = 0,
\]
\[
\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 16 = 0.
\]

Factoring the quadratic equation, we get

\[
(\lambda - 1)(\lambda - 16) = 0.
\]

So, the eigenvalues are \(\lambda = 1\) and \(\lambda = 16\). The maximum value of \( f(x, y) \) subject to \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \) is 16, which occurs when \(\lambda = 16\). Therefore, the operator norm of \( A \) is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{16} = 4.

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by considering the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[1^n = 1 \text{ for any integer } n.\]

In this problem, the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\), which is a very large number. However, the property of exponents with base 1 tells us that the result will still be 1. Therefore, we have:

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression becomes:
\[
z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} = z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3.
\]
From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[
z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1.

"To calculate \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base \(9\), we can follow these steps:

   - For \(58_9\):
     \[
     58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

   - For \(18_9\):

     18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To determine how many treeks are equivalent in weight to one squig, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let's define the variables:
- \( T \) represents the weight of one treek.
- \( S \) represents the weight of one squig.
- \( G \) represents the weight of one goolee.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:
1. Diez treeks pesan tan do like three squigs and one goolee:
   \[
   10T = 3S + G
   \]

2. Two treeks and one goolee are equal in weight to one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to solve this system of equations to find the value of \( T \) in terms of \( S \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute \( G = S - 2T \) into the first equation:
\[
10T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]

Simplify the right-hand side:
\[
10T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
\[
10T = 4S - 2T
\]

Add \( 2T \) to both sides to combine the \( T \) terms:
\[
12T = 4S
\]

Divide both sides by 12 to solve for \( T \):
\[
T = \frac{4S}{12}
\]
\[
T = \frac{S}{3}
\]

Thus, one treek weighs \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the weight of one squig. To find out how many treeks are equivalent to one squig, we take the reciprocal of \(\frac{1}{3}\):
\[
\text{Number of treeks} = 3

Therefore, the weight组合 of \(\boxed{3}\) treeks is equivalent to the weight of one squig.","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True
"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we will expand the product and compare the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\).

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot bt = 3bt^3
\]
\[
3t^2 \cdot (-2) = -6t^2
\]

\[
5t \cdot 4t^2 = 20t^3
\]
\[
5t \cdot bt = 5bt^2
\]
\[
5t \cdot (-2) = -10t
\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a
\]

Now, we combine all these terms:
\[
12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we group the like terms together:
\[
12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We compare this expanded form with the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). By equating the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\), we get the following system of equations:

1. \(12t^4\) term: \(12 = 12\) (This is always true and does not provide new information.)
2. \(t^3\) term: \(3b + 20 = 26\)
3. \(t^2\) term: \(-6 + 5b + 4a = -8\)
4. \(t\) term: \(-10 + ab = -16\)
5. Constant term: \(-2a = 6\)

We solve these equations step by step.

From the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6
\]
\[
a = -3
\]

Substitute \(a = -3\) into the \(t^3\) term equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]
\[
3b = 6
\]
\[
b = 2
\]

Now, we have \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\). To find \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cylinder. We are given that the tank is being filled at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour and that the level of water rises at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \) and the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is \( \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \).

We can use the chain rule to relate the rates of change of volume and height:

\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dh} \cdot \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Since the volume \( V \) is a function of the height \( h \) and the radius \( r \) is constant, we have:

\[ \frac{dV}{dh} = \pi r^2 \]

Substituting this into the chain rule equation, we get:

\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):

\[ 20 = r^2 \cdot 4 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[ r^2 = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

For the graph of \(y = f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) in the piece \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the two pieces of the function.

Therefore, we need:
\[a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a.\]

To solve this inequality, we rearrange it:
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0.\]
We factor out \(a\):
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0.\]
We factor the quadratic expression:
\[a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0.\]

We determine the roots of the equation \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) = 0\), which are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). These roots divide the real number line into four intervals: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\). We test a point from each interval to determine where the inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\):
  \[(-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\):
  \[(-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\):
  \[(1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\):
  \[(3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12 \not\leq 0.\]
  The inequality does not hold.

We also check the roots:
- For \(a = -1\):
  \[(-1)(-1 - 2)(-1 + 1) = (-1)(-3)(0) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 0\):
  \[(0)(0 - 2)(0 + 1) = (0)(-2)(1) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.
- For \(a = 2\):
  \[(2)(2 - 2)(2 + 1) = (2)(0)(3) = 0 \leq 0.\]
  The inequality holds.

Therefore, the inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) holds for \(a \in [-1, 2]\). The largest value of \(a\) in this interval is \(2\).

Thus, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) has a radius of length 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \((x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2\). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of length 1, the right-hand side of the equation must equal \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the values of \(x\) for which \(f(x) = x\):
\[
f(x) = x \implies \lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\), we substitute \(f(x)\) into itself:
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
If \(x \neq 0\), we can divide both sides by \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = 1.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1 \implies \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) = 1.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 = 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get a cubic equation in \(x\):
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, we need to find other solutions to the cubic equation that are not equal to \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

To do this, we substitute \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the cubic equation and verify that it satisfies the equation:
\[
-\lambda^4 \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Simplifying each term, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^3}{\lambda^3} + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2) \cdot \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda^2} - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda) \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0,
\]
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^3 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1)^2 - \lambda (1 + \lambda)(\lambda - 1) + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
Factoring out \(\lambda - 1\) from each term, we get:
\[
(\lambda - 1) \left[-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1}\right] = 0.
\]
Since \(\lambda \neq 1\), we can divide by \(\lambda - 1\):
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \frac{\lambda^2 - 1}{\lambda - 1} = 0.
\]
Simplifying the right-hand side, we get:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda (1 + \lambda) + \lambda + 1 = 0.
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
-\lambda (\lambda - 1)^2 + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)(\lambda - 1) - \lambda^2 + 1 = 0.
\]
This equation is satisfied for all \(\lambda\), so we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the cubic equation has a root other than \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). By analyzing the behavior of the function \(f(f(x)) - x\) and the conditions for a cubic equation to have a root in the interval \([0,1]\), we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy this condition are \(2 < \lambda \le 4\).

Therefore, the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists an \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\) are:

"To find the measure of the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) for which

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ},
\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the identity \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos(90^\circ - x) = \sin x\) to rewrite \(\cos 85^\circ\):

\[
\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ.
\]

So the numerator becomes:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\) to rewrite \(\sin 85^\circ\):

\[
\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ.
\]

So the denominator becomes:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this, we use the tangent addition formula. Notice that:

\[
\cos 25^\circ = \sin(90^\circ - 25^\circ) = \sin 65^\circ.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 65^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

We can use the identity \(\sin(65^\circ + 5^\circ) = \sin 70^\circ\) and the identity \(\sin(25^\circ - 5^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\sin 70^\circ}{\sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Using the identity \(\sin(90^\circ - x) = \cos x\), we get:

\[
\sin 70^\circ = \cos 20^\circ.
\]

So the expression becomes:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 20^\circ}{\sin 20^\circ} = \cot 20^\circ = \tan(90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan 70^\circ.

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider the fact that some of the letters are repeated. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" and ""P"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \) (for each of the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" and ""P"")

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"To determine the number of trailing zeros in \(42!\), we need to find out how many times 10 is a factor in the product. Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), and there are generally more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials, we only need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to 42.

We use the formula for finding the number of times a prime number \(p\) is a factor in \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots
\]
For \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\), we calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1:

\[

"To find the maximum value of the function \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) where \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \), we start by analyzing the function and its behavior.

First, let's consider the partial derivatives of \( f(x, y) \) with respect to \( x \) and \( y \):

\[
f_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule, we get:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} + x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y)
\]

Simplifying the second term:

\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Combining the terms over a common denominator:

\[
f_x = \frac{(1 - y^2) - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = \frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Setting \( f_x = 0 \):

\[
\frac{1 - y^2 - xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
1 - y^2 - xy = 0
\]

Solving for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1 - y^2}{y}
\]

Next, we consider the partial derivative with respect to \( y \):

\[
f_y = \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \right)
\]

Using the product rule again, we get:

\[
f_y = x \cdot \frac{1}{2} (1 - y^2)^{-1/2} \cdot (-2y) + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Simplifying the first term:

\[
f_y = -\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2}
\]

Setting \( f_y = 0 \):

\[
-\frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}} + \sqrt{1 - x^2} = 0
\]

This implies:

\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

Squaring both sides:

\[
1 - x^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - y^2}
\]

Multiplying both sides by \( 1 - y^2 \):

\[
(1 - x^2)(1 - y^2) = x^2 y^2
\]

Expanding and simplifying:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]

Subtracting \( x^2 y^2 \) from both sides:

\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]

Solving for \( x^2 + y^2 \):

\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

This equation represents a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. We now evaluate \( f(x, y) \) on this circle. Let \( x = \cos \theta \) and \( y = \sin \theta \) for \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \). Substituting these into \( f(x, y) \):

\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta}
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity \( \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \) and \( \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \sin \theta \):

\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta
\]

Using the Pythagorean identity again:

\[
\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]

Thus, \( f(x, y) = 1 \) for all points \((x, y)\) on the circle \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

Finally, we check the boundary conditions where \( x = \pm 1 \) or \( y = \pm 1 \):

- If \( x = 1 \), then \( f(1, y) = 1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 1 when \( y = 0 \).
- If \( x = -1 \), then \( f(-1, y) = -1 \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) is 0 when \( y = 0 \).
- If \( y = 1 \), then \( f(x, 1) = x \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 1 when \( x = 0 \).
- If \( y = -1 \), then \( f(x, -1) = x \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \). The maximum value of \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) is 0 when \( x = 0 \).

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\).

Given:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\[
\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

The cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\) is calculated using the determinant of a matrix formed by the unit vectors \(\mathbf{i}\), \(\mathbf{j}\), \(\mathbf{k}\) and the components of \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\):

\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\
1 & 2 & 3 \\
-3 & -2 & 1
\end{vmatrix}

We expand this determinant along the first row:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \mathbf{i} \left(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)\right) - \mathbf{j} \left(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)\right) + \mathbf{k} \left(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3)\right)
\]

Simplify each component:
\[
\mathbf{i} \left(2 + 6\right) = \mathbf{i} \cdot 8
\]
\[
-\mathbf{j} \left(1 + 9\right) = -\mathbf{j} \cdot 10
\]
\[
\mathbf{k} \left(-2 + 6\right) = \mathbf{k} \cdot 4
\]

Thus, the cross product is:
\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = 8\mathbf{i} - 10\mathbf{j} + 4\mathbf{k}
\]

Next, we find the magnitude of the cross product vector:
\[
\|\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\| = \sqrt{(8)^2 + (-10)^2 + (4)^2}

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \( z = e^{i\theta} \). Then, we have:

\[ z + \frac{1}{z} = e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta. \]

Equating this to \(\phi\), we get:

Similarly, if \( z = e^{-i\pi/5} \), then:

\[ z^{85} = \left(e^{-i\pi/5}\right)^{85} = e^{-i\cdot 85 \cdot \pi/5} = e^{-i\cdot 17\pi} = e^{-i\cdot (16\pi + \pi)} = e^{-i\pi} = -1. \]

In both cases, we have \( z^{85} = -1 \). Therefore:

\[ z^{85} + \frac{1}{z^{85}} = -1 + \frac{1}{-1} = -1 - 1 = -2. \]

"To solve the problem, we start by noting that the centroid \(G\) of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex. This means that \(AG:GD = 2:1\), \(BG:GE = 2:1\), and \(CG:GF = 2:1\).

Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\) and passes through the centroid \(G\), triangles \(AMN\) and \(ABC\) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion. The similarity ratio of the triangles \(AMN\) to \(ABC\) is the same as the ratio of the distances from the centroid to the base \(BC\) to the total height from vertex \(A\) to \(BC\). This ratio is \( \frac{AG}{AD} = \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Therefore, the area ratio of triangle \(AMN\) to triangle \(ABC\) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

Given that the area of triangle \(ABC\) is 144, the area of triangle \(AMN\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle AMN = \frac{4}{9} \times 144 = 64

Next, we need to find the area of triangle \(ENG\). Since \(MN\) is parallel to \(BC\), triangle \(ENG\) is similar to triangle \(EBC\) with the same similarity ratio of \( \frac{2}{3} \). The area ratio of triangle \(ENG\) to triangle \(EBC\) is \( \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 = \frac{4}{9} \).

The area of triangle \(EBC\) is half the area of triangle \(ABC\) because \(E\) is the midpoint of \(AC\). Therefore, the area of triangle \(EBC\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle EBC = \frac{1}{2} \times 144 = 72
\]

The area of triangle \(ENG\) is:
\[
\text{Area of } \triangle ENG = \frac{4}{9} \times 72 = 32

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, and \(d\) is the common difference.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]

"To determine how many two-digit positive integers are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers and then identify all two-digit factors of the GCD.

First, let's find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2

\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2

- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things:
1. Hillary has a total of 11 monedas.
2. The total value of the monedas is 75 centavos.

We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + n - d - n = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):

"To determine the probability that the sum of the numbers Paul and Jesse choose is even, we first identify the first six prime numbers. These are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we note that the sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. Among the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number (2) and five odd numbers (3, 5, 7, 11, 13).

We calculate the total number of possible outcomes when Paul and Jesse each choose a number. Since each of them has 6 choices, the total number of outcomes is:
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

Now, we calculate the number of favorable outcomes where the sum is even. This can happen in two scenarios:
1. Both Paul and Jesse choose an even number.
2. Both Paul and Jesse choose an odd number.

For the first scenario, there is only one even number (2), so the number of ways both can choose an even number is:

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 whose digits are all zeros and ones, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

A number that is a multiple of 450 must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5 in its prime factorization. Since the digits of the number can only be 0 or 1, the number must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This means the number must have at least two trailing zeros.

Next, we need to ensure that the remaining part of the number (after the trailing zeros) is a multiple of 2 and \(3^2 = 9\). A number is a multiple of 2 if its last digit is even, and since the digits are only 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0. However, we already have two trailing zeros, so we only need to ensure that the remaining part is a multiple of 9. A number is a multiple of 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.

Let's consider the smallest number that ends in 00 and has digits that are either 0 or 1, and check if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9. The smallest such number is 11111111100. Let's check the sum of its digits:

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\). Therefore, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64}\), and the expression simplifies to:

"To find the sum of the roots of the function \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we start by recalling the properties of polynomial functions and their roots. Specifically, the sum of the roots of a polynomial \( a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \cdots + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_{n-1}}{a_n}\).

First, we need to determine the polynomial \( g(x) \). Since \( g(x) = f(x + 5) \), we substitute \( x + 5 \) into the function \( f(x) \):
\[
g(x) = f(x + 5) = (x + 5)^3 - 49(x + 5)^2 + 623(x + 5) - 2015.
\]
Next, we expand each term:
\[
(x + 5)^3 = x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125,
\]
\[
-49(x + 5)^2 = -49(x^2 + 10x + 25) = -49x^2 - 490x - 1225,
\]
\[
623(x + 5) = 623x + 3115.
\]
Now, we combine all these expanded terms:
\[
g(x) = (x^3 + 15x^2 + 75x + 125) + (-49x^2 - 490x - 1225) + (623x + 3115) - 2015.
\]
We combine like terms:
\[
g(x) = x^3 + (15 - 49)x^2 + (75 - 490 + 623)x + (125 - 1225 + 3115 - 2015).
\]
Simplifying the coefficients, we get:
\[
g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x + 0.
\]
The polynomial \( g(x) \) is \( x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \). The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 \) is given by \(-\frac{a_2}{a_3}\). Here, \( a_3 = 1 \) and \( a_2 = -34 \), so the sum of the roots is:
\[
-\frac{-34}{1} = 34.

Therefore, the sum of the roots of \( g(x) \) is \(\boxed{34}\).","[34, '34']",34,"[34, '34']",True
"To find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ} = 1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 20^\circ + 1 + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ.
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ\). We use the fact that \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(40^\circ\) are the angles of a triangle with the third angle being \(110^\circ\). There is a known trigonometric identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle:

\[
\tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 C = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (\pi - (A+B)) = \tan^2 A + \tan^2 B + \tan^2 (A+B) - 2\tan A \tan B \tan (A+B).
\]

For \(A = 10^\circ\), \(B = 20^\circ\), and \(C = 110^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (180^\circ - 70^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 110^\circ = -\tan 70^\circ\), \(\tan^2 110^\circ = \tan^2 70^\circ\). Therefore, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 (90^\circ - 20^\circ) = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity for the sum of the squares of the tangents of the angles of a triangle again, but this time for a different set of angles. For the angles \(10^\circ\), \(20^\circ\), and \(70^\circ\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 70^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ.
\]

Since \(\tan 70^\circ = \cot 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 10^\circ \tan 20^\circ \cot 20^\circ = \tan 10^\circ\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

This implies that:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ - 2\tan 10^\circ.
\]

Thus, we have:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3.
\]

Therefore, the value of the original expression is:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ = 3 + 3 = 6.

"To determine the number of sides of a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles minus one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Recall the formula for the sum of the interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = 180(n-2) \text{ degrees}
   \]

2. **Set up the equation based on the given information:**
   According to the problem, the sum of all the interior angles minus one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - 1 = 1070
   \]

3. **Substitute the formula for \(S\) into the equation:**
   Substitute \(S = 180(n-2)\) into the equation \(S - 1 = 1070\):
   \[
   180(n-2) - 1 = 1070
   \]

4. **Solve for \(n\):**
   First, add 1 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \(n\):
   \[
   180(n-2) = 1071
   \]
   Next, divide both sides by 180 to solve for \(n-2\):
   \[
   n-2 = \frac{1071}{180}
   \]
   Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   n-2 = 5.95
   \]
   Since \(n-2\) must be an integer (because \(n\) is the number of sides of a polygon), we round 5.95 to the nearest whole number, which is 6. Therefore:
   \[
   n-2 = 6
   \]
   Finally, add 2 to both sides to solve for \(n\):

"To find the unique odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by expressing the condition mathematically. This means that:

\[
t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Expanding and rearranging the equation, we get:

\[
t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23}
\]

This is a quadratic congruence. To solve it, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values in, we have:

\[
t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. This means we need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[
x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

We can test values of \( x \) from 0 to 22 to find a solution. After testing, we find that:

\[
5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23}
\]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv -5 \pmod{23} \). Substituting these values back into the expression for \( t \), we get two possible solutions:

\[
t = -1 + 5 = 4 \quad \text{or} \quad t = -1 - 5 = -6
\]

Since we are looking for an odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \), we discard \( t = 4 \) and keep \( t = -6 \). To convert \(-6\) to a positive integer modulo 23, we add 23:

\[
-6 + 23 = 17
\]

Therefore, the unique odd integer \( t \) is:

\[
\boxed{17}
\]

To verify, we check that \( t = 17 \) satisfies the original condition:

\[
t+2 = 17+2 = 19
\]

And we check if \( 19 \) is the inverse of \( 17 \) modulo 23:

\[
17 \cdot 19 = 323
\]

Since \( 323 \div 23 = 14 \) with a remainder of 1, we have:

\[
323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23}
\]

Thus, \( 19 \) is indeed the inverse of \( 17 \) modulo 23, confirming that our solution is correct. The unique odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the total surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Find the total surface area by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

First, we know that the volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length of the cube. Given that the volume is 1 cubic foot, we can set up the equation:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we need to convert the side length from feet to inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, the side length in inches is:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 12 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we calculate the area of one face of the cube. The area \( A \) of one face is given by:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length in inches, we get:
\[ A = (12 \text{ inches})^2 = 144 \text{ square inches} \]

Finally, we find the total surface area of the cube by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6):
\[ \text{Total Surface Area} = 6 \times 144 \text{ square inches} = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

"To find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate radical, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a binomial expression \(a + b\) is \(a - b\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the original number by its conjugate:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:
\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2

Now, we calculate the squares:
\[

\[

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}, \quad \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):

\[

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

\[

We can further distribute each term:

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[
6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix} + 2 \begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} - 3 \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}.

We can now perform the scalar multiplications:

"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), by the Angle Bisector Theorem, we have:
\[
\frac{AB}{AD} = \frac{BC}{CD} \implies \frac{AB}{a} = \frac{b}{c} \implies AB = \frac{ab}{c}
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times \text{height}
\]
The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance from \(AD\) to \(BC\), which is equal to \(CD = c\) because \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\). Therefore, the area of the trapezoid can be written as:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times c = 42
\]
This gives us the equation:
\[
(a + b) \times c = 84
\]

Next, we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times CD = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c
\]

We also know that the area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times \text{height} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c
\]

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is the sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\):
\[
[ABCD] = [\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times c + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times c = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times (a + b) = 42
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), so:
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) have the same height \(c\) and their bases \(AD\) and \(BC\) are in the ratio \(a : b\). Therefore, the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are also in the ratio \(a : b\). Let the area of \(\triangle ACD\) be \(x\) and the area of \(\triangle ABC\) be \(y\). Then:
\[
\frac{x}{y} = \frac{a}{b}
\]
Since \(x + y = 42\), we can express \(y\) as:
\[
y = \frac{b}{a} x
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(x + y = 42\), we get:
\[
x + \frac{b}{a} x = 42 \implies x \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42 \implies x \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42 \implies x = \frac{42a}{a + b}
\]
From the equation \((a + b) \times c = 84\), we have \(a + b = \frac{84}{c}\). Substituting this into the equation for \(x\), we get:
\[
x = \frac{42a}{\frac{84}{c}} = \frac{42a \times c}{84} = \frac{a \times c}{2}
\]
Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{a \times c}{2}
\]
We already know that \((a + b) \times c = 84\), and since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are equal. Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we will follow these steps:

1. **Square both sides of the equation** to eliminate the square roots:

   \]
   This simplifies to:

2. **Cross-multiply** to clear the fraction:
   \[
   4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
   \]
   Simplify both sides:
   \[
   8x = 27x - 9

3. **Isolate the variable \(x\)** by subtracting \(27x\) from both sides:

   \[
   \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{27}{19} - \frac{19}{19}}} = \frac{\sqrt{\frac{18}{19}}}{\sqrt{\frac{8}{19}}}

"To solve the problem, we need to apply the given operation \( @ \) to the fractions \(\frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{10}{21}\). The operation is defined as:

\[
\frac{m}{n} @ \frac{p}{q} = (m)(p)\left(\frac{q}{n}\right)
\]

Here, \(\frac{m}{n} = \frac{7}{30}\) and \(\frac{p}{q} = \frac{10}{21}\). Therefore, we substitute \(m = 7\), \(n = 30\), \(p = 10\), and \(q = 21\) into the operation:

\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

First, we calculate the product of \(7\) and \(10\):

\[
7 \times 10 = 70
\]

Next, we multiply \(70\) by \(\frac{21}{30}\):

\[
70 \times \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \times 21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the fraction \(\frac{70 \times 21}{30}\) by canceling out the common factors. Notice that \(70\) and \(30\) have a common factor of \(10\):

\[
\frac{70 \times 21}{30} = \frac{(10 \times 7) \times 21}{10 \times 3} = \frac{7 \times 21}{3}

Now, we calculate \(7 \times 21\):

\[

"To determine the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence. However, since the points are on a circle, we need to account for the fact that rotating the points does not create a new arrangement. Therefore, we divide by 4 to account for these rotations. Additionally, we need to divide by 2 because the circle can be flipped (i.e., the points can be in clockwise or counterclockwise order), which does not create a new arrangement. Thus, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   However, this calculation is incorrect for our specific problem. Instead, we should consider the number of ways to choose 2 points out of 4 to form the first segment, and then the remaining 2 points will automatically form the second segment. This gives us:
   \[
   \binom{4}{2} = 6
   \]
   But we need to consider the order in which we choose the segments, so we multiply by 2 (since we can choose either segment first):
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12
   \]
   However, this is also incorrect. The correct approach is to consider the number of ways to arrange 4 points such that they alternate. This is simply the number of ways to choose 2 out of 4 positions for the first segment, which is:
   \[
   2
   \]

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: As mentioned, the points must alternate. There are 2 ways to arrange the points such that they alternate (either \(A\) and \(C\) are next to each other, or \(A\) and \(D\) are next to each other).

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of arrangements. Therefore, the probability is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

Thus, the probability that the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is \(\boxed{\frac{1}{3}}\).","[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",\frac{1}{3},"[1/3, '\\frac{1}{3}']",True
"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle.

First, let's calculate the area of the larger circle:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times (2)^2 = 4\pi
\]

Given that the area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle, we have:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Next, we need to determine the areas of the two shaded regions in the diagram. The shaded region consists of two parts:
1. A segment of the larger circle.
2. A segment of the smaller circle.

Let \(\theta\) be the measure of \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. The area of the sector of the larger circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times (2)^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times 4\pi = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 2 \times 2 \times \sin(\theta) = 2\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the larger circle} = \text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} - \text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} - 2\sin(\theta)
\]

Similarly, the area of the sector of the smaller circle with central angle \(\theta\) is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi \times (1)^2 = \frac{\theta}{360^\circ} \times \pi = \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ}
\]

The area of the triangle \(ADC\) in the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{1}{2} \times AD \times DC \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 1 \times \sin(\theta) = \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

The area of the segment of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the segment of the smaller circle} = \text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} - \text{Area of triangle } ADC = \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of the two segments:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = \left( \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} - 2\sin(\theta) \right) + \left( \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) \right)
\]

Combining the terms, we get:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = \frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} + \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

To combine the fractions, we find a common denominator:
\[
\frac{\pi \theta}{90^\circ} = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ}
\]

Thus:
\[
\text{Total area of the shaded region} = \frac{4\pi \theta}{360^\circ} + \frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - 2\sin(\theta) - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta)
\]

We know this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\):
\[
\frac{5\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{5}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]

Divide both sides by 5:
\[
\frac{\pi \theta}{360^\circ} - \frac{1}{2}\sin(\theta) = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]

Multiply both sides by 360:
\[
\pi \theta - 180\sin(\theta) = 120\pi
\]

Divide both sides by \(\pi\):
\[
\theta - 180\sin\left(\frac{\theta}{180^\circ}\right) = 120
\]

Let \(x = \frac{\theta}{180^\circ}\). Then \(\theta = 180x\) and the equation becomes:
\[
180x - 180\sin(x) = 120
\]

Divide both sides by 180:
\[
x - \sin(x) = \frac{2}{3}
\]

We need to solve this equation for \(x\). By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that \(x = \frac{2\pi}{3}\) satisfies the equation:
\[
\frac{2\pi}{3} - \sin\left(\frac{2\pi}{3}\right) = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} \approx 2.094 - 0.866 = 1.228 \approx \frac{2}{3}

Thus:
\[
x = \frac{2\pi}{3}
\]

Therefore:
\[
\theta = 180x = 180 \times \frac{2\pi}{3} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many cylindrical glasses are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylindrical glass and the spherical tank and then divide the volume of the tank by the volume of the glass.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical glass. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cylinder is:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical glass, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[
V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \text{ cubic cm}

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:

This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the equation. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2
\]
\[
= \left(\frac{2 \sqrt{3}}{10}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{5}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{10}\right)^2

This involves calculating the total number of possible subcommittees and then subtracting the number of subcommittees that do not meet the condition (i.e., subcommittees consisting only of republicans or only of democrats).

\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = \frac{8 \times 7 \times 6}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = 56
\]

Similarly, we calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that consists only of democrats. There are 6 democrats, so we need to choose 5 out of these 6:

\[
\binom{6}{5} = \frac{6!}{5!(6-5)!} = \frac{6!}{5! \cdot 1!} = \frac{6}{1} = 6
\]

The number of subcommittees that do not meet the condition (i.e., subcommittees consisting only of republicans or only of democrats) is the sum of the two values calculated above:

\[
56 + 6 = 62
\]

Finally, we subtract the number of subcommittees that do not meet the condition from the total number of subcommittees to find the number of subcommittees that include at least one member from each party:

\[
2002 - 62 = 1940
\]

Thus, the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members that has at least one member from each party is \(\boxed{1940}\).","[1940, '1940']",1940,"[1940, '1940']",True
"To find the value of \(513^2 - 487^2\), we can use the difference of squares formula. The difference of squares formula states that:

\[
a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b)
\]

In this problem, \(a = 513\) and \(b = 487\). Let's apply the formula step by step.

1. Calculate \(a - b\):
\[
a - b = 513 - 487 = 26
\]

2. Calculate \(a + b\):
\[
a + b = 513 + 487 = 1000
\]

3. Substitute \(a - b\) and \(a + b\) into the difference of squares formula:
\[
513^2 - 487^2 = (513 - 487)(513 + 487) = 26 \times 1000

4. Perform the multiplication:

"To solve the problem, let's denote the three consecutive integers as \( n-1 \), \( n \), and \( n+1 \).

First, we know that the product of these three integers is 120:
\[
(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1) = 120
\]

Next, we are given that this product divided by the mean of the three integers is 24. The mean of the three integers is:
\[
\frac{(n-1) + n + (n+1)}{3} = \frac{3n}{3} = n
\]

According to the problem, the product divided by the mean is 24:
\[
\frac{(n-1) \cdot n \cdot (n+1)}{n} = 24
\]

Simplifying the left-hand side, we get:
\[
(n-1) \cdot (n+1) = 24
\]

We recognize that \((n-1) \cdot (n+1)\) is a difference of squares:
\[
n^2 - 1 = 24
\]

Adding 1 to both sides, we obtain:
\[
n^2 = 25
\]

Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
n = 5 \quad \text{or} \quad n = -5
\]

We need to determine which value of \( n \) gives us three consecutive integers whose product is 120. Let's check both cases:

1. If \( n = 5 \):
   \[
   (n-1) = 4, \quad n = 5, \quad (n+1) = 6
   \]
   The product is:
   \[
   4 \cdot 5 \cdot 6 = 120

   This satisfies the condition.

2. If \( n = -5 \):
   \[
   (n-1) = -6, \quad n = -5, \quad (n+1) = -4
   \]
   The product is:
   \[
   (-6) \cdot (-5) \cdot (-4) = -120

   This does not satisfy the condition.

Therefore, the only valid solution is \( n = 5 \). The three consecutive integers are 4, 5, and 6. The largest of these integers is:

"To solve the equation \(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4} = 16\), we start by eliminating the cube root by cubing both sides of the equation. This gives us:

\[
(\sqrt[3]{x^2 - 4x + 4})^3 = 16^3
\]

Simplifying both sides, we get:

\[
x^2 - 4x + 4 = 4096
\]

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\[
(x-2)^2 = 4096
\]

To solve for \(x\), we take the square root of both sides of the equation. Remember that taking the square root of a number gives both a positive and a negative result. Therefore, we have:

\[
x-2 = \pm \sqrt{4096}
\]

Since \(\sqrt{4096} = 64\), the equation becomes:

\[
x-2 = 64 \quad \text{or} \quad x-2 = -64
\]

Solving these two equations separately, we get:

\[
x = 64 + 2 = 66 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -64 + 2 = -62

Since we are asked to find the positive value of \(x\), we take the solution \(x = 66\).

"To simplify the expression \(\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac {16 \pi}{15} \right)\), we start by noting that \(\cos \left( \frac{16 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( 2\pi - \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( -\frac{14 \pi}{15} \right) = \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right)\). Thus, the expression becomes:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \frac{6\pi}{15}, \frac{8\pi}{15}, \frac{10\pi}{15}, \frac{12\pi}{15}, \frac{14\pi}{15}\). However, we only need the product of four specific cosines. To proceed, we use the fact that:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

Since \(\sin \left( \frac{16\pi}{15} \right) = -\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\), the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

We know from the double-angle identity that \(\sin \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) = 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)\). Substituting this in, we get:

\[
\frac{-\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}{16 \cdot 2 \sin \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)} = \frac{-1}{32 \cos \left( \frac{\pi}{15} \right)}.
\]

However, we need to re-evaluate the product directly using the specific identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. The correct approach is to use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression directly:

\[

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we have a point \(D\) on \(\overline{AM}\) such that \(AD = 10\) and \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). We need to find the perimeter of triangle \(ABC\).

First, let's denote \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\). Since \(AM\) is the altitude, it is also the angle bisector and the median of \(\triangle ABC\). Therefore, \(\angle BAM = \angle CAM = \frac{\theta}{2}\).

In \(\triangle BDM\), we have \(\angle BDM = 180^\circ - \angle BDC = 180^\circ - 3\theta\). Using the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDM\), we get:
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{DM}{\sin (180^\circ - 3\theta)} = \frac{DM}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\), we have:
\[
BD = \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}
\]

Next, we use the Law of Sines in \(\triangle BDC\):
\[
\frac{BD}{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)} = \frac{BC}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(BC = 2BM\) and \(BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - AM^2} = \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2}\), we have:
\[
BD = \frac{BC}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta} = \frac{2BM}{2} \cdot \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta} = BM \cdot \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Equating the two expressions for \(BD\), we get:
\[
\frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta} = BM \cdot \frac{\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)}{\sin 3\theta}
\]
Since \(\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \neq 0\), we can cancel \(\sin \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)\) from both sides:
\[
1 = BM
\]
Thus, \(BM = 1\). Since \(BM = \sqrt{AB^2 - 11^2}\), we have:
\[
1 = \sqrt{AB^2 - 121} \implies 1^2 = AB^2 - 121 \implies 1 = AB^2 - 121 \implies AB^2 = 122 \implies AB = \sqrt{122}
\]
Since \(AB = AC\), the perimeter of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{122} + \sqrt{122} + 2 \cdot 1 = 2\sqrt{122} + 2

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of an odd number of consecutive integers is the middle number. Since there are 27 integers, the median is the 14th number in the sequence. The 14th number is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it into two parts and solve each part separately.

First, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\). Since \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\), their sum \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always non-negative. Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\), which means \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\). So, this part of the inequality does not restrict the values of \(x\).

Next, consider the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). We can rewrite this inequality as:
\[x^4 + 4x^2 - 21 < 0.\]
Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes a quadratic in terms of \(y\):
\[y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0.\]
We need to find the roots of the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\). Using the quadratic formula \(y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\), where \(a = 1\), \(b = 4\), and \(c = -21\), we get:
\[y = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 84}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{100}}{2} = \frac{-4 \pm 10}{2}.\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[y = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad y = \frac{-14}{2} = -7.\]
Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard the negative root \(y = -7\). Therefore, we have \(0 \leq y < 3\), which means \(0 \leq x^2 < 3\). Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:

\[

\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]

From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]

Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),

\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Adding 72 to both sides, we get:
\[

\[
s = 4.

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female passengers for each grade. Since there are 300 female students in each grade, \(135\%\) of 300 is:
\[
135\% \times 300 = 1.35 \times 300 = 405

So, we need to find the grade where the number of male passengers is closest to 405.

Now, let's calculate the number of male passengers for each grade:
- For the 9th grade, the number of male passengers is \(41.1\% \times 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\).
- For the 10th grade, the number of male passengers is \(34.4\% \times 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\).
- For the 11th grade, the number of male passengers is \(20.6\% \times 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\).
- For the 12th grade, the number of male passengers is \(11.6\% \times 300 = 0.116 \times 300 = 34.8\).

Next, we compare the number of male passengers for each grade to 405:
- For the 9th grade, the difference is \(405 - 123.3 = 281.7\).
- For the 10th grade, the difference is \(405 - 103.2 = 301.8\).
- For the 11th grade, the difference is \(405 - 61.8 = 343.2\).
- For the 12th grade, the difference is \(405 - 34.8 = 370.2\).

The smallest difference is 281.7, which corresponds to the 9th grade. Therefore, the grade where the number of male passengers on the bus is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female passengers on the bus is the 9th grade.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
So, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) is equal to \((x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) \geq 0\) and equal to \(-(x-9)(x+9)\) when \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\). The roots of the equation \((x-9)(x+9) = 0\) are \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 9)\), and \((9, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \((x-9)(x+9)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (-9, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (9, \infty)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9) > 0\).

Therefore, we can write:

Now, let's consider the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\). We can factor it as:
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The roots of the equation \(x(x-36) = 0\) are \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). These roots divide the real number line into three intervals: \((-\infty, 0)\), \((0, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

Next, let's analyze the sign of \(x(x-36)\) in each interval:
- For \(x \in (-\infty, 0)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).
- For \(x \in (0, 36)\), \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative, so \(x(x-36) < 0\).
- For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are positive, so \(x(x-36) > 0\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x < 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 < 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is positive.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 < 0\), the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x-36)\). The quotient is:
   \[\frac{(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)}.\]
   Since \(x-9 > 0\), \(x+9 > 0\), \(x > 0\), and \(x-36 > 0\), the quotient is positive.

We also need to check the points where the numerator or the denominator is zero. The numerator is zero at \(x = 9\) and \(x = -9\), and the denominator is zero at \(x = 0\) and \(x = 36\). At these points, the expression is undefined.

Therefore, the solution to the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\) is:

"To determine the largest possible area of the rectangular field enclosed by the track, we start by defining the variables. Let the length of the rectangle be \( L \) and the width be \( W \). The track consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles at the ends. The radius of each semicircle is \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the track is given as 400 meters. This length includes the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \frac{\pi W}{2} \). Therefore, the total length of the track is:
\[
L + L + \frac{\pi W}{2} + \frac{\pi W}{2} = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know this total length is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by:
\[
A = L \times W
\]
Substituting the expression for \( L \) into the area formula, we get:
\[
A = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
\pi W = 200 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the expression for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100
\]
Now, we calculate the area \( A \) using \( L = 100 \) and \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \):
\[
A = L \times W = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

Therefore, the largest possible area of the field is:

"To find \(\sin{T}\) in \(\triangle RST\), we start by identifying the given information and the properties of the triangle. We know that \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\) and that \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\). The hypotenuse of the triangle is \(RT = 5\).

The sine of an angle in a right triangle is defined as the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle R\), the opposite side is \(ST\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{ST}{RT} = \frac{ST}{5} = \frac{2}{5}
\]
From this, we can see that \(ST = 2\).

Next, we need to find the length of the side \(RS\). We can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In \(\triangle RST\), the Pythagorean theorem gives:
\[
RT^2 = RS^2 + ST^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(RT = 5\) and \(ST = 2\), we get:
\[
5^2 = RS^2 + 2^2
\]
\[
25 = RS^2 + 4
\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides, we find:
\[
RS^2 = 21
\]
Taking the positive square root of both sides, we get:
\[
RS = \sqrt{21}
\]

Now, we need to find \(\sin{T}\). The sine of an angle in a right triangle is the ratio of the length of the opposite side to the length of the hypotenuse. For \(\angle T\), the opposite side is \(RS\) and the hypotenuse is \(RT\). Therefore, we can write:
\[

"To find the minimum distance between the origin and a point on the graph of \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the graph. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

To find the minimum value of \( D \), we need to minimize the function \( f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \). We do this by taking the derivative of \( f(x) \) and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = \frac{d}{dx} \left( \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2} \right)
\]

Using the power rule, we get:

\[
f'(x) = 2x^3 - 4x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero to find the critical points:

\[
2x^3 - 4x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 2x \):

\[
2x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2
\]

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We now evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points to determine the minimum value:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = \frac{1}{2}(0)^4 - 2(0)^2 + \frac{9}{2} = \frac{9}{2}
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{-4}{2} + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = \frac{5}{2}
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(-\sqrt{2})^4 - 2(-\sqrt{2})^2 + \frac{9}{2}
\]

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = \frac{1}{2}(4) - 2(2) + \frac{9}{2}

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = 2 - 4 + \frac{9}{2}

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = -2 + \frac{9}{2}

\[

\[

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is \( \frac{5}{2} \). Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) is within the domain \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]

Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]

"To solve for the distance from point \( P \) to the sixth vertex of the octahedron, we start by noting the properties of a regular octahedron. A regular octahedron has 6 vertices, 12 edges, and 8 equilateral triangular faces. The vertices can be arranged such that they form two pyramids with a square base, and the edges connecting the vertices of the two pyramids are all of equal length.

Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) such that \( A, B, C, D \) form a square and \( E \) and \( F \) are the vertices above and below the center of the square, respectively. The edges of the octahedron are all of the same length, say \( s \).

Given the distances from point \( P \) to five of the vertices are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's assume without loss of generality that the distances from \( P \) to \( A, B, C, D, E \) are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, respectively. We need to find the distance from \( P \) to \( F \).

In a regular octahedron, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. This is a known geometric property. Therefore, we can write:

\[
PA^2 + PB^2 + PC^2 + PD^2 + PE^2 + PF^2 = k
\]

where \( k \) is a constant. Since the octahedron is regular, the value of \( k \) is the same for any point inside the octahedron. We can use the given distances to find \( k \):

\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + PF^2 = k
\]

Calculating the squares, we get:

\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + PF^2 = k
\]

\[
324 + PF^2 = k
\]

Now, we need to find the value of \( k \). To do this, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to six times the square of the circumradius of the octahedron. The circumradius \( R \) of a regular octahedron with edge length \( s \) is given by:

\[
R = \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2}
\]

The square of the circumradius is:

\[
R^2 = \left( \frac{s\sqrt{2}}{2} \right)^2 = \frac{2s^2}{4} = \frac{s^2}{2}
\]

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is:

\[
k = 6R^2 = 6 \cdot \frac{s^2}{2} = 3s^2
\]

Since the edge length \( s \) is the same for all edges of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is constant. We already know that:

\[
324 + PF^2 = k
\]

To find \( k \), we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside the octahedron to the vertices is equal to six times the square of the circumradius.

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's béisball, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that force is equal to mass times acceleration. Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

where \( F \) is the force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.

Jen wants to launch her softball with the same force as Jack launches his béisball. Therefore, the force \( F \) is the same for both. Let's denote the mass of Jen's softball as \( m_J = 200 \) g and the mass of Jack's béisball as \( m_B = 150 \) g. Let \( a_J \) be the acceleration of Jen's softball and \( a_B \) be the acceleration of Jack's béisball. According to Newton's second law, we can write:

\[ F = m_J \cdot a_J \]
\[ F = m_B \cdot a_B \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_B \cdot a_B \]

Substituting the given masses into the equation, we get:

To find the ratio of the acceleration of Jen's softball to the acceleration of Jack's béisball, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_B} \):

We can simplify the fraction by dividing the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation of \(629_{10}\) as \(1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) contains the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) contains the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Counting these, we find there are 3 common digits.

"To determine the total number of handshakes that occurred in the reunion, we need to consider the interactions between the brujas and the hechiceros. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Identify the number of brujas and hechiceros:**
   - There are 6 brujas.
   - There are 10 hechiceros.

2. **Determine the handshakes between brujas and hechiceros:**
   - Each bruja shakes hands with each hechicero.
   - Therefore, the total number of handshakes between brujas and hechiceros is calculated by multiplying the number of brujas by the number of hechiceros:
     \[
     6 \text{ brujas} \times 10 \text{ hechiceros} = 60 \text{ handshakes}
     \]

3. **Consider the handshakes among the hechiceros:**
   - According to the problem, no hechiceros shake hands with each other.
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes among the hechiceros is 0.

4. **Consider the handshakes among the brujas:**
   - According to the problem, no brujas shake hands with each other.
   - Therefore, the number of handshakes among the brujas is 0.

5. **Calculate the total number of handshakes:**
   - The total number of handshakes is the sum of the handshakes between brujas and hechiceros, the handshakes among the hechiceros, and the handshakes among the brujas:
     \[
     60 \text{ handshakes} + 0 \text{ handshakes} + 0 \text{ handshakes} = 60 \text{ handshakes}

"To find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \).

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:
\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \).

So, we need to compute \( g(1) \):
\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the polynomial \( f(x) \):
\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line.

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\):

\[
y = 2x - 2 \implies 2x - y - 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\).

Substitute these values into the distance formula:

\[
d = \frac{|2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2)|}{\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}}
\]

Simplify the numerator:

\[
2(6) + (-1)(0) + (-2) = 12 + 0 - 2 = 10
\]

So, the numerator is \(|10| = 10\).

Simplify the denominator:

\[
\sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 1} = \sqrt{5}

Now, divide the numerator by the denominator:

\[

To rationalize the denominator, multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,

\[

From Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0.

To find \(S_1 S_2 S_3\), we use the identity:

\[
(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4) - (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2.
\]

Substituting the values from Vieta's formulas, we get:

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = 2 \cdot (-2) - 0^2 = -4.
\]

Since \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = -4\), the numbers \(S_1, S_2, S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - 0t^2 + 0t + 4 = t^3 + 4 = 0\).

We are given two equations based on the problem statement:

First, we simplify the fraction by performing the division:

\[

\]

We can convert this fraction into a decimal by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by a power of 2 to make the denominator a power of 10. Since \(500 = 2^2 \times 5^3\), we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^1 = 2\):

\[

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point within the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = a\) and \(AD = b\). Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a = kb\).

The distance from a point \((x,y)\) to the center \(O\) is:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \((x,y)\) to vertex \(A\) is:

\]

The distance from \((x,y)\) to vertex \(D\) is:

\]
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + \frac{a}{2})^2 + (y + \frac{b}{2})^2}

Squaring all sides of each inequality, we get:

\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - ax + \frac{a^2}{4} + y^2 \implies 0 < -ax + \frac{a^2}{4} \implies \frac{a^2}{4a} < x \implies \frac{a}{4} < x

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

The number of students who received a score of 80 is 20, so the total score for these students is:

Then, we calculate the sum of the numbers in the third row:

Since the sums of the rows must be equal, we set the sum of the first row equal to the sum of the second row:

\[
d = \sqrt{250000} = 500
\]
So, Jim travels 500 pies.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha travels. Martha camina along the length and the width of the field. The total distance she travels is the sum of the length and the width:
\[
\text{Distance Martha travels} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700
\]
So, Martha travels 700 pies.

To find out how many pies less that Martha camina Jim, we subtract the distance Jim travels from the distance Martha travels:
\[
\text{Difference} = 700 - 500 = 200
\]
Therefore, Jim camina \(\boxed{200}\) pies less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance that can be recorried if we start at any point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visit the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the perimeter of each possible triangle formed by these points and then find the minimum of these perimeters.

Let's calculate the perimeter of each triangle:

1. **Triangle \(ABD\):**
   - Side \(AB = 6\)
   - Side \(BD = 3\)
   - Side \(DA = 5\)
   - Perimeter \(ABD = 6 + 3 + 5 = 14\)

2. **Triangle \(ABC\):**
   - Side \(AB = 6\)
   - Side \(BC = 5\)
   - Side \(CA = 6\)
   - Perimeter \(ABC = 6 + 5 + 6 = 17\)

3. **Triangle \(ACD\):**
   - Side \(AC = 6\)
   - Side \(CD = 4\)
   - Side \(DA = 5\)
   - Perimeter \(ACD = 6 + 4 + 5 = 15\)

4. **Triangle \(BCD\):**
   - Side \(BC = 5\)
   - Side \(CD = 4\)
   - Side \(DB = 3\)
   - Perimeter \(BCD = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12\)

Now, we compare the perimeters of the four triangles:
- Perimeter of \(ABD = 14\)
- Perimeter of \(ABC = 17\)
- Perimeter of \(ACD = 15\)
- Perimeter of \(BCD = 12\)

The shortest perimeter is 12, which corresponds to triangle \(BCD\).

Therefore, the shortest distance that can be recorried is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",13,"[13, '13']",False
