"Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\) in the right triangle \(DEF\) with \(\angle EFD = 90^\circ\), we need to find the length of \(DE\).

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite \(\angle D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). We are given that \(EF = 7\) and \(\sin D = 0.7\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
To find \(DF\), we solve the equation:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Next, we use the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of \(DE\). The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]
Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\), we get:
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]
Simplifying the equation, we have:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]
Subtracting 49 from both sides, we get:
\[
DE^2 = 51
\]
Taking the square root of both sides, we find:
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Therefore, the length of \(DE\) is \(\boxed{\sqrt{51}}\).","[sqrt(51), '\\sqrt{51}']",\sqrt{51},[],True
"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by an angle of \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can use the formula for rotation in the complex plane. The rotation of a complex number \( z \) around a point \( c \) by an angle \( \theta \) is given by:

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\theta} \]

Here, \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \). The angle of rotation is \( \frac{\pi}{4} \), so \( \theta = \frac{\pi}{4} \) and \( e^{i\theta} = e^{i\pi/4} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \).

First, we need to find \( z - c \):

\[ z - c = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \]

Next, we multiply \( z - c \) by \( e^{i\pi/4} \):

\[ (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) \]

We use the distributive property (FOIL method) to expand this product:

\[ (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \right) = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \]

Simplify each term:

\[ \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \]
\[ \sqrt{2} \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = i \]
\[ -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i \cdot \frac{2}{2} = -3i \]
\[ -3\sqrt{2}i \cdot i\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} = -3i^2 \cdot \frac{2}{2} = -3(-1) = 3 \]

Combine the terms:

\[ 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i \]

Now, we add this result to \( c \):

\[ w = c + (z - c) e^{i\pi/4} = (2 - 3i) + (4 - 2i) = 6 - 5i \]

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is:

\[ \boxed{6 - 5i} \]","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that three specific people (比埃尔, Рuzha, and Tomas) must sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat the three specific people as a single unit**: Since比埃尔, Рuzha, and Tomas must sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block and the other 5 individuals) around a table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units around the table**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) people around a table is \((n-1)!\). Here, we have 6 units, so the number of ways to arrange them is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange the people within the block**: Within the block,比埃尔, Рuzha, and Tomas can be arranged among themselves in \(3!\) ways. So, the number of ways to arrange them within the block is \(3! = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table, with比埃尔, Рuzha, and Tomas sitting together, is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange the people within the block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways to arrange 8 people around a table such that比埃尔, Рuzha, and Tomas must sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"为了找到表达式 \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\) 的展开式中的常数项，我们将使用二项式定理。二项式定理表明：

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

在我们的情况下，\(a = 10x^3\)，\(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\)，且 \(n = 5\)。展开式中的通项由下式给出：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

我们需要找到 \(x\) 的幂为零的项（常数项）。让我们简化通项：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

首先，简化 \(x\) 的幂：

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]

\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot x^{-2k}
\]

将这些结果结合起来：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5-k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot x^{15-3k} \cdot x^{-2k}
\]

合并 \(x\) 的幂：

\[
T_k = \binom{5}{k} \cdot 10^{5-k} \cdot (-1)^k \cdot 2^{-k} \cdot x^{15-5k}
\]

为了使 \(T_k\) 成为常数项，\(x\) 的指数必须为零：

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]

解 \(k\)：

\[
15 = 5k
\]

\[
k = 3

现在，将 \(k = 3\) 代回通项中以找到常数项：

\[
T_3 = \binom{5}{3} \cdot 10^{5-3} \cdot (-1)^3 \cdot 2^{-3} \cdot x^{15-5(3)}
\]

简化每一部分：

\[
\binom{5}{3} = \frac{5!}{3!(5-3)!} = \frac{5!}{3!2!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3!}{3! \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10

\[
10^{5-3} = 10^2 = 100

\[

\[
2^{-3} = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \((n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6)\) is divided by 7. We start by substituting \( n = 2 \) into the expression:

\[
(n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) \pmod{7}
\]

Simplifying inside the parentheses, we get:

\[
(2 + 2)(2 + 4)(2 + 6) = 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 8
\]

Next, we reduce each factor modulo 7:

\[
4 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
6 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
8 \equiv 8 - 7 = 1 \pmod{7}

So the expression becomes:

\[
4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \equiv 4 \cdot 6 \pmod{7}
\]

Now, we calculate \( 4 \cdot 6 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

Finally, we reduce 24 modulo 7:

\[
24 \div 7 = 3 \text{ remainder } 3 \quad \text{or} \quad 24 \equiv 3 \pmod{7}

"To determine the minimum number of degrees a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we start by noting that a regular pentagon has five equal sides and five equal angles. The sum of the interior angles of a pentagon is given by the formula \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\), where \(n\) is the number of sides. For a pentagon, \(n = 5\), so the sum of the interior angles is:

\[
(5-2) \times 180^\circ = 3 \times 180^\circ = 540^\circ
\]

Since the pentagon is regular, each interior angle is:

\[
\frac{540^\circ}{5} = 108^\circ
\]

However, we are interested in the angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles. The angle of rotation that will return the pentagon to its original position is given by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the number of sides of the pentagon. Therefore, the angle of rotation is:

\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ
\]

Thus, the minimum number of degrees that the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is:

" given the coordinates of three vertices of a parallelogram \((5, 3)\), \((6, 8)\), and \((7, 4)\), we need to find the coordinates of the fourth vertex \((x, y)\) such that \(x > 7\), and then determine the value of \(x + y\).

In a parallelogram, the diagonals bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal. Let's denote the fourth vertex as \((x, y)\).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((5, 3)\) and \((7, 4)\):
\[
\left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal connecting \((6, 8)\) and \((x, y)\):
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, these two midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

We solve the first equation for \(x\):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6
\]
\[
6 + x = 12
\]
\[
x = 6
\]

However, we are given that \(x > 7\), so \(x = 6\) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering the possibility that the given vertices might not form a parallelogram with the given condition.

 instead, we consider the possibility that the given vertices might form a parallelogram with the given condition.

"To determine the vertical and horizontal asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to analyze the behavior of the function as \( x \) approaches certain values and as \( x \) approaches infinity.

### Step 1: Find the vertical asymptotes
Vertical asymptotes occur where the denominator of the function is zero, provided the numerator is not zero at the same points. So, we need to solve the equation:
\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = 0 \]
This is a quadratic equation, which can be factored as:
\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0 \]
Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ x = 7 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]
Therefore, the vertical asymptotes are at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). So, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

### Step 2: Find the horizontal asymptote
Horizontal asymptotes are determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). So, \( c = 0 \).

### Step 3: Calculate \( a + b + c \)
Now, we add the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ a + b + c = 7 + (-2) + 0 = 5 \]

Therefore, the final answer is:

"To find the smallest positive number \( C \) such that

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

for all vectors \(\bold{v}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^2\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To do this, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers. Define the function

\[
f(x, y) = 4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2
\]

and the constraint

\[
g(x, y) = x^2 + y^2 - 1 = 0.
\]

The gradients of \( f \) and \( g \) are

\[
\nabla f = (8x + 12y, 12x + 26y)
\]
\[
\nabla g = (2x, 2y).
\]

Setting \(\nabla f = \lambda \nabla g\), we get the system of equations

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x,
\]
\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y,
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1.
\]

From the first equation, we have

\[
8x + 12y = 2\lambda x \implies 4x + 6y = \lambda x \implies \lambda = 4 + \frac{6y}{x}.
\]

From the second equation, we have

\[
12x + 26y = 2\lambda y \implies 6x + 13y = \lambda y \implies \lambda = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Setting the two expressions for \(\lambda\) equal to each other, we get

\[
4 + \frac{6y}{x} = \frac{6x}{y} + 13.
\]

Multiplying through by \( xy \) to clear the denominators, we obtain

\[
4xy + 6y^2 = 6x^2 + 13xy \implies 6y^2 - 6x^2 = 9xy \implies 2y^2 - 2x^2 = 3xy \implies 2(y^2 - x^2) = 3xy \implies 2y^2 - 3xy - 2x^2 = 0.
\]

This is a quadratic equation in \( y \). We can solve it using the quadratic formula \( y = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 2 \), \( b = -3x \), and \( c = -2x^2 \):

\[
y = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{(-3x)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2x^2)}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{9x^2 + 16x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm \sqrt{25x^2}}{4} = \frac{3x \pm 5x}{4}.
\]

This gives us two solutions for \( y \):

\[
y = \frac{8x}{4} = 2x \quad \text{or} \quad y = \frac{-2x}{4} = -\frac{x}{2}.
\]

We substitute these solutions back into the constraint \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \).

1. If \( y = 2x \), then

\[
x^2 + (2x)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + 4x^2 = 1 \implies 5x^2 = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = 2 \cdot -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{5} + 12 \cdot \frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{4}{5} = \frac{4}{5} + \frac{24}{5} + \frac{52}{5} = \frac{80}{5} = 16.
\]

2. If \( y = -\frac{x}{2} \), then

\[
x^2 + \left( -\frac{x}{2} \right)^2 = 1 \implies x^2 + \frac{x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{4x^2 + x^2}{4} = 1 \implies \frac{5x^2}{4} = 1 \implies x^2 = \frac{4}{5} \implies x = \pm \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}.
\]

If \( x = \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( -\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.
\]

If \( x = -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \), then \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \). Therefore,

\[
f\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}}, \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) = 4\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 + 12\left( -\frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \right)\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right) + 13\left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}} \right)^2 = 4 \cdot \frac{4}{5} + 12 \cdot -\frac{2}{5} + 13 \cdot \frac{1}{5} = \frac{16}{5} - \frac{24}{5} + \frac{13}{5} = \frac{5}{5} = 1.

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:

   58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of one tricycle in terms of skoifiers. Let's define the variables as follows:
- Let \( t \) be the weight of one tricycle in skoifiers.
- Let \( s \) be the weight of one skoifier in skoifiers.
- Let \( j \) be the weight of one swola in skoifiers.

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. Ten tricycles weigh three skoifiers and one swola.
2. Two tricycles and one swola weigh the same as one swola.

First, let's translate these equations into mathematical expressions:
1. \( 10t = 3s + j \)
2. \( 2t + j = s \)

We need to find the value of \( t \) in terms of \( s \). To do this, we can eliminate \( j \) by solving the second equation for \( j \) and then substituting it into the first equation.

From the second equation:
\[ j = s - 2t \]

Now substitute \( j = s - 2t \) into the first equation:
\[ 10t = 3s + (s - 2t) \]
\[ 10t = 3s + s - 2t \]
\[ 10t = 4s - 2t \]
\[ 10t + 2t = 4s \]
\[ 12t = 4s \]
\[ t = \frac{4s}{12} \]
\[ t = \frac{s}{3} \]

So, the weight of one tricycle is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of the weight of one swola. Therefore, the weight of the sum of ten tricycles is:
\[ 10t = 10 \left( \frac{s}{3} \right) = \frac{10s}{3} \]

We need to find the number of swolas that weigh the same as \(\frac{10s}{3}\) skoifiers. Since one swola weighs \( s \) skoifiers, the number of swolas is:
\[ \frac{\frac{10s}{3}}{s} = \frac{10s}{3s} = \frac{10}{3} \]

Thus, the weight of the sum of ten tricycles is equal to the weight of \(\frac{10}{3}\) swolas. The final answer is:

First, let's expand the product:
\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We will use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials) to expand this product. We will multiply each term in the first polynomial by each term in the second polynomial:

\[
3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 = 12t^4
\]
\[

\[

\[

\[

\]

\[
a \cdot 4t^2 = 4at^2
\]
\[
a \cdot bt = abt
\]
\[
a \cdot (-2) = -2a

\[

We know this expression must equal \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we can set the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) equal to each other:

"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we start by using the information given about the rate at which the tank is being filled and the rate at which the water level rises.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both intervals \(x \geq a\) and \(x < a\).

1. **For \(x \geq a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax^2\). This is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). The minimum value of \(f(x)\) in this interval occurs at \(x = a\), and it is \(f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3\). Therefore, for \(x \geq a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \([a^3, \infty)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((-\infty, a^3]\) if \(a < 0\).

2. **For \(x < a\):**
   The function is given by \(f(x) = ax + 2a\). This is a straight line with slope \(a\). If \(a > 0\), the line is increasing, and as \(x\) approaches \(-\infty\), \(f(x)\) approaches \(-\infty\). As \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left, \(f(x)\) approaches \(a \cdot a + 2a = a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, for \(x < a\), the function \(f(x)\) takes all values in the interval \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) if \(a > 0\) and \((a^2 + 2a, \infty)\) if \(a < 0\).

For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect each horizontal line at least once, the intervals \([a^3, \infty)\) and \((-\infty, a^2 + 2a)\) must overlap. This means that \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\).

Let's solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\):
\[a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0\]
\[a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0\]
\[a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\]

We need to determine the intervals where this inequality holds. The roots of the equation \(a(a-2)(a+1) = 0\) are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We can test the sign of the expression \(a(a-2)(a+1)\) in the intervals determined by these roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2-2)(-2+1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5-2)(-0.5+1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625\), which is positive.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1-2)(1+1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2\), which is negative.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3-2)(3+1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12\), which is positive.

The inequality \(a(a-2)(a+1) \leq 0\) holds in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\), \([0, 2]\). Since we are looking for the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects each horizontal line at least once, we take the maximum value in the interval \([0, 2]\), which is \(a = 2\).

"为了确定 value of \( c \) that makes the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) have a radius of 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \)-terms and the \( y \)-terms separately.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \(25\). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \(9\). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the circle to have a radius of 1, the right-hand side of the equation must be equal to \(1^2 = 1\). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solving for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]

f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging the equation, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

For the second case, we expand and simplify the equation:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = \lambda^2 (1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 - x + \lambda x^2 - \lambda x^3) = \lambda^2 (1 - (\lambda + 1)x + (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda x^3).
\]
So the equation becomes:
\[
\lambda^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x^3 - 1 = 0 \implies -\lambda^3 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + 1)x^2 - \lambda^3 x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We already know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must also satisfy \(f(f(x)) = x\). However, we are looking for values of \(\lambda\) such that there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) with \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\). Therefore, we need to find the values of \(\lambda\) for which the cubic equation has a root in \([0,1]\) that is not equal to \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By inspection, we test \(\lambda = 2\):
\[
f(x) = 2x(1 - x) = 2x - 2x^2.
\]
Then,
\[
f(f(x)) = f(2x - 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - (2x - 2x^2)) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 2x^2)(1 - 2x + 2x^2) = 2(2x - 4x^2 + 4x^3 - 2x^2 + 4x^3 - 4x^4) = 2(2x - 6x^2 + 8x^3 - 4x^4) = 4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4.
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
4x - 12x^2 + 16x^3 - 8x^4 = x \implies -8x^4 + 16x^3 - 12x^2 + 3x = 0 \implies x(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or the roots of the cubic polynomial \(-8x^3 + 16x^2 - 12x + 3 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{2}, \pm \frac{1}{4}, \pm \frac{1}{8}, \pm 3\). Testing \(x = \frac{1}{2}\):
\[
-8\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 + 16\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - 12\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) + 3 = -8 \cdot \frac{1}{8} + 16 \cdot \frac{1}{4} - 12 \cdot \frac{1}{2} + 3 = -1 + 4 - 6 + 3 = 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a root. Since \(f\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\), \(x = \frac{1}{2}\) is a fixed point, not a solution to \(f(x) \neq x\). However, we need to check if there are other roots in \([0,1]\) that are not equal to \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

By further analysis or numerical methods, we find that the only value of \(\lambda\) in the interval \([0,4]\) that satisfies the condition is \(\lambda = 3\). For \(\lambda = 3\), we have:
\[
f(x) = 3x(1 - x) = 3x - 3x^2,
\]
\[
f(f(x)) = f(3x - 3x^2) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(1 - (3x - 3x^2)) = 3(3x - 3x^2)(1 - 3x + 3x^2) = 3(3x - 9x^2 + 9x^3 - 3x^2 + 9x^3 - 9x^4) = 3(3x - 12x^2 + 18x^3 - 9x^4) = 9x - 36x^2 + 54x^3 - 27x^4.
\]
We need this to equal \(x\):
\[
9x - 36x^2 + 54x^3 - 27x^4 = x \implies -27x^4 + 54x^3 - 36x^2 + 8x = 0 \implies x(-27x^3 + 54x^2 - 36x + 8) = 0.
\]
This gives us \(x = 0\) or the roots of the cubic polynomial \(-27x^3 + 54x^2 - 36x + 8 = 0\). By the Rational Root Theorem, we test possible rational roots \(\pm 1, \pm \frac{1}{3}, \pm \frac{1}{9}, \pm \frac{1}{27}, \pm 2, \pm \frac{2}{3}, \pm \frac{2}{9}, \pm \frac{2}{27}, \pm 4, \pm \frac{4}{3}, \pm \frac{4}{9}, \pm \frac{4}{27}\). Testing \(x = \frac{2}{3}\):
\[
-27\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^3 + 54\left(\frac{2}{3}\right)^2 - 36\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) + 8 = -27 \cdot \frac{8}{27} + 54 \cdot \frac{4}{9} - 36 \cdot \frac{2}{3} + 8 = -8 + 24 - 24 + 8 = 0.
\]
So, \(x = \frac{2}{3}\) is a root. Since \(f\left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \left(1 - \frac{2}{3}\right) = 3 \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\), \(x = \frac{2}{3}\) is a fixed point, not a solution to \(f(x) \neq x\). However, we need to check if there are other roots in \([0,1]\) that are not equal to \(0\) or \(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\).

\]

we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. First, consider the numerator:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for cosine:

\[
(\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula \(\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\):

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Now, consider the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ.
\]

We can group the terms to use the angle addition formula for sine:

\[
(\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula \(\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B\), we get:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\):

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute the simplified numerator and denominator back into the original expression:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this expression, we divide the numerator and the denominator by \(\cos 25^\circ\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{1 + \tan 5^\circ}{\tan 25^\circ - 1}.
\]

We recognize that this expression is in the form of the tangent of a sum of angles. Specifically, we use the tangent addition formula:

\[
\tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}.
\]

By comparing, we see that:

\[
\tan \theta = \tan(25^\circ + 5^\circ) = \tan 30^\circ.

Therefore, the smallest positive angle \(\theta\) is:

\[

"To determine the number of ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE,"" we need to consider that some of the letters are repeated. Specifically, the letter ""L"" appears 3 times, and the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"" each appear 1 time.

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""E"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_5 \)) is 1.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
\frac{7!}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!}
\]

First, we calculate the factorials:
- \( 7! = 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 5040 \)
- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)
- \( 1! = 1 \) (for each of the letters ""E,"" ""I,"" ""P,"" and ""S"")

Now, substitute these factorial values back into the formula:

\[
\frac{5040}{3! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1! \cdot 1!} = \frac{5040}{6 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1 \cdot 1} = \frac{5040}{6} = 840

Therefore, the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters in the word ""LLIPSE"" is:

"为了确定 \(42!\) (42 factored) conclude with, we need to find the highest power of 10 that divides \(42!\). Since \(10 = 2 \times 5\), we need to count the number of pairs of factors 2 and 5 in the prime factorization of \(42!\). The number of such pairs is determined by the number of times 5 appears as a factor, because there are always more factors of 2 than factors of 5 in factorials.

We use the formula for finding the highest power of a prime \(p\) dividing \(n!\), which is given by:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{n}{p} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^2} \right\rfloor + \left\lfloor \frac{n}{p^3} \right\rfloor + \cdots

Here, \(n = 42\) and \(p = 5\). We calculate each term in the series until the quotient is less than 1.

3. The third term is:
\[
\left\lfloor \frac{42}{125} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor 0.336 \right\rfloor = 0

Since the third term is 0, all subsequent terms will also be 0. Therefore, the highest power of 5 that divides \(42!\) is:

"为了找到函数 \( f(x, y) = x \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值，其中 \( -1 \le x, y \le 1 \)，我们首先考虑函数的定义域和边界条件。

首先，我们检查函数在边界上的值。如果 \( x = 1 \)，则 \( f(1, y) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = \sqrt{1 - y^2} \)。函数 \( \sqrt{1 - y^2} \) 的最大值发生在 \( y = 0 \) 时，给出 \( f(1, 0) = 1 \)。

同样，如果 \( x = -1 \)，则 \( f(-1, y) = -1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - y^2} + y \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} = -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \)。函数 \( -\sqrt{1 - y^2} \) 的最大值发生在 \( y = 0 \) 时，给出 \( f(-1, 0) = 0 \)。

如果 \( y = 1 \)，则 \( f(x, 1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} + 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = \sqrt{1 - x^2} \)。函数 \( \sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值发生在 \( x = 0 \) 时，给出 \( f(0, 1) = 1 \)。

如果 \( y = -1 \)，则 \( f(x, -1) = x \cdot \sqrt{1 - (-1)^2} + (-1) \cdot \sqrt{1 - x^2} = -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \)。函数 \( -\sqrt{1 - x^2} \) 的最大值发生在 \( x = 0 \) 时，给出 \( f(0, -1) = 0 \)。

接下来，我们考虑函数在内部点。为此，我们对 \( f(x, y) \) 求偏导数并将其设为零。

函数 \( f(x, y) \) 的偏导数为：
\[
f_x = \sqrt{1 - y^2} - \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
\[
f_y = \sqrt{1 - x^2} - \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}

将 \( f_x = 0 \) 和 \( f_y = 0 \)，我们得到：
\[
\sqrt{1 - y^2} = \frac{xy}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}}
\]
\[
\sqrt{1 - x^2} = \frac{yx}{\sqrt{1 - y^2}}
\]

从第一个方程，我们两边平方得到：
\[
1 - y^2 = \frac{x^2 y^2}{1 - x^2}
\]
两边乘以 \( 1 - x^2 \) 得到：
\[
(1 - y^2)(1 - x^2) = x^2 y^2
\]
展开并简化，我们得到：
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 + x^2 y^2 = x^2 y^2
\]
\[
1 - x^2 - y^2 = 0
\]
\[
x^2 + y^2 = 1
\]

这个方程表示单位圆。在单位圆上，我们可以使用 \( x = \cos \theta \) 和 \( y = \sin \theta \) 对于 \( 0 \le \theta < 2\pi \)。将这些代入函数 \( f(x, y) \)，我们得到：
\[
f(\cos \theta, \sin \theta) = \cos \theta \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \theta} + \sin \theta \sqrt{1 - \cos^2 \theta} = \cos \theta \cos \theta + \sin \theta \sin \theta = \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1
\]

"To find the area of triangle \(OAB\), we can use the formula for the area of a triangle given two vectors \(\overrightarrow{OA}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB}\) originating from the same point \(O\). The area is given by half the magnitude of the cross product of these two vectors.

First, we need to find the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\overrightarrow{u} = \begin{pmatrix} u_1 \\ u_2 \\ u_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\]

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} -3 \\ -2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

\[
\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{vmatrix} \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\ 1 & 2 & 3 \\ -3 & -2 & 1 \end{vmatrix} = \mathbf{i}(2 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-2)) - \mathbf{j}(1 \cdot 1 - 3 \cdot (-3)) + \mathbf{k}(1 \cdot (-2) - 2 \cdot (-3))

Next, we need to find the magnitude of the cross product vector \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The magnitude of a vector \(\overrightarrow{v} = \begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ v_2 \\ v_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

\[
\|\overrightarrow{v}\| = \sqrt{v_1^2 + v_2^2 + v_3^2}

For \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB} = \begin{pmatrix} 8 \\ -10 \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}\), we have:

We can express \(z\) in polar form as \(z = re^{i\theta}\). Since \(z + \frac{1}{z}\) is real, \(z\) must lie on the unit circle, so \(r = 1\). Thus, we can write \(z = e^{i\theta}\). Substituting this into the equation, we get:

\[ e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = \phi. \]

Using Euler's formula, \(e^{i\theta} + e^{-i\theta} = 2\cos\theta\), we have:

\[ 2\cos\theta = \phi. \]

Therefore,

\[ \cos\theta = \frac{\phi}{2} = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{4}. \]

The angle \(\theta\) that satisfies this equation is \(\theta = \pm \frac{\pi}{5}\). Thus, we have two possible values for \(z\):

\[ z = e^{i\pi/5} \quad \text{or} \quad z = e^{-i\pi/5}. \]

In both cases, we have \(z^{85} = -1\), so:

"To solve for the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by understanding the properties of the centroid \( G \) of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid \( G \) divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that the line passing through \( G \) and parallel to \( BC \) intersects \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \), we can use the properties of similar triangles. Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line passing through the centroid. Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \). Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

The area ratio of two similar triangles is the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides. Thus, the area of triangle \( AMN \) is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times \text{Area of } \triangle ABC = \frac{1}{3} \times 144 = 48

Triangle \( AMN \) is similar to triangle \( ABC \) with a ratio of \( \frac{2}{3} \), and triangle \( AGB \) is one of the three equal areas of triangle \( ABC \). Since \( M \) and \( N \) are on \( AB \) and \( AC \) respectively, and \( MN \parallel BC \), triangle \( ENG \) is similar to triangle \( AGB \) with the same ratio of \( \frac{2}{3} \) for the sides.

Thus, the area of triangle \( ENG \) is:

\left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^2 \times \text{Area of } \triangle AGB = \frac{4}{9} \times 48 = \frac{192}{9} = \frac{64}{3}

"To find the sixth term in the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

"要将分数 \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) 转换为 decimal terminating number, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Simplify the denominator**: The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\). We can rewrite this as \(4 \cdot 78125\), but it is more useful to keep it in its prime factorized form for now.

2. **Adjust the fraction to have a power of 10 in the denominator**: To convert the fraction into a decimal terminating number, the denominator must be a power of 10. A power of 10 is of the form \(2^a \cdot 5^a\). Therefore, we need to make the exponents of 2 and 5 in the denominator equal.

   The exponent of 2 in the denominator is 2, and the exponent of 5 is 7. To make them equal, we need to multiply the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) (since \(7 - 2 = 5\)).

   \[
   \frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{2^2 \cdot 5^7 \cdot 2^5} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{2^7 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{672}{10^7}

"To determine the number of two-digit positive integers that are factors of both 100 and 150, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these two numbers and then identify all two-digit factors of the GCD.

\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2

\[

This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

First, we list all the divisors of 24. The divisors of 24 are:

- Let \( d \) be the number of dimes.
- Let \( n \) be the number of nickels.

We know two things:
1. Heloise has a total of 11 coins.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 cents.

We can express these two pieces of information as the following equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 10d + 5n = 75 \)

First, we can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ 2d + n = 15 \]

Now we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( d + n = 11 \)
2. \( 2d + n = 15 \)

To eliminate \( n \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (2d + n) - (d + n) = 15 - 11 \]
\[ 2d + n - d - n = 4 \]
\[ d = 4 \]

Now that we know \( d = 4 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( n \):
\[ 4 + n = 11 \]
\[ n = 11 - 4 \]
\[ n = 7 \]

" first, let's identify the first six prime numbers. They are: \(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

Next, we need to determine the probability that the sum of the two numbers chosen by波尔 and吉西 is even. The sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd.

First, let's count the number of even and odd prime numbers in the list:
- Even prime numbers: \(2\) (1 number)
- Odd prime numbers: \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\) (5 numbers)

Now, we calculate the probability of each scenario:

1. **Both numbers are even:**
   - There is only 1 even number, so the probability that波尔 chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
   - Similarly, the probability that吉西 chooses an even number is \(\frac{1}{6}\).
   - Therefore, the probability that both numbers are even is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{6} \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{1}{36}

2. **Both numbers are odd:**
   - There are 5 odd numbers, so the probability that波尔 chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
   - Similarly, the probability that吉西 chooses an odd number is \(\frac{5}{6}\).
   - Therefore, the probability that both numbers are odd is:

\[3(4) + 2y = 12\]

Next, perform the multiplication:

\[12 + 2y = 12\]

Now, isolate the term involving \(y\) by subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation:

\[2y = 12 - 12\]
\[2y = 0\]

Then, solve for \(y\) by dividing both sides by 2:

\[y = \frac{0}{2}\]
\[y = 0\]

The base of this triangle is 2 units and the height is 4 units. The area \(A_1\) of a right triangle is given by the formula:

Next, let's consider the triangle formed by the points \((0, 4)\), \((3, 4)\), and \((3, 0)\). This is also a right triangle with the base along the x-axis and the height along the y-axis.

"To find the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1, we need to consider the prime factorization of 450. The prime factorization of 450 is:

\[ 450 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

For a number to be a multiple of 450, it must include at least one factor of 2, two factors of 3, and two factors of 5. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, it must end in 00 to satisfy the factor of \(5^2\). This is because a number ending in 00 is divisible by 100, and thus by \(5^2 = 25\).

Next, we need to ensure that the number contains at least one factor of 2. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the last digit must be 0 to satisfy this condition.

Now, we need to ensure that the number contains at least two factors of 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since the number can only contain the digits 0 and 1, the sum of its digits will be the number of 1's in the number. Therefore, we need at least two 1's in the number to satisfy the factor of \(3^2 = 9\).

Combining these conditions, the smallest number that meets all the criteria is 1100. Let's verify:

- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- It contains two 1's, so the sum of its digits is 2, which is not divisible by 9. Therefore, we need to find a larger number.

Let's try 11100. Let's verify:

- It ends in 00, so it is divisible by \(5^2 = 25\).
- It ends in 0, so it is divisible by 2.
- It contains three 1's, so the sum of its digits is 3, which is divisible by 3.

Since 11100 meets all the criteria, it is the smallest positive multiple of 450 that consists only of the digits 0 and 1. Therefore, the answer is:

- The first spin can result in any of the numbers 1, 2, 6, or 9.
- The second spin can result in any of the numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Since each spin is independent and each number is equally likely, there are a total of \(4 \times 4 = 16\) possible outcomes.

Next, we need to determine which of these outcomes result in the cat landing on a shaded square. The wheel is divided into 12 equal sections, and 6 of these sections are shaded. Therefore, half of the possible outcomes will result in the cat landing on a shaded square.

To confirm, let's list all the possible outcomes and identify the shaded ones:
- If the first spin is 1, the possible outcomes are: (1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (1,4). All of these are shaded.
- If the first spin is 2, the possible outcomes are: (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (2,4). All of these are shaded.

- If the first spin is 9, the possible outcomes are: (9,1), (9,2), (9,3), (9,4). All of these are shaded.

Next, we convert this fraction to a decimal by performing the division \(4321 \div 20000000\):

\[

\[
\sin 100^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) = \sin 80^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 120^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) = \sin 60^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 140^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) = \sin 40^\circ,
\]
\[
\sin 160^\circ = \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ) = \sin 20^\circ.
\]

Thus, the original expression becomes:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 20^\circ = (\sin 20^\circ)^2 (\sin 40^\circ)^2 (\sin 60^\circ)^2 (\sin 80^\circ)^2.
\]

We know that \(\sin 60^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\), so \((\sin 60^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{4}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 \cdot \frac{3}{4}.
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of sines of angles in arithmetic progression. Specifically, for \(n = 3\) and \(\theta = 20^\circ\), we have:

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sin 3 \cdot 20^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 60^\circ}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}}{4 \sin 20^\circ} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}.
\]

Thus, \((\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{8 \sin 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ}\). Substituting this back into our expression, we get:

\[
\frac{3}{64 \sin^2 20^\circ} \cdot \frac{3}{4} = \frac{9}{256 \sin^2 20^\circ}.

We know from the identity \(\sin^2 x = \frac{1 - \cos 2x}{2}\) that \(\sin^2 20^\circ = \frac{1 - \cos 40^\circ}{2}\). However, a simpler approach is to use the known result for this specific product of sines, which is \(\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 80^\circ = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{8}\).

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

\[
\|\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{3^2 + 2^2 + 6^2} = \sqrt{9 + 4 + 36} = \sqrt{49} = 7

Now, we need to find the value of \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

Let \(t = \tan 20^\circ\). Then the equation becomes:

\[
t^3 - 3\sqrt{3}t^2 - 3t + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

We can factor this polynomial as:

\[
(t - \sqrt{3})(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1) = 0.
\]

The roots of the quadratic equation \(t^2 - 2\sqrt{3}t - 1 = 0\) are:

\[
t = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{(2\sqrt{3})^2 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm \sqrt{12 + 4}}{2} = \frac{2\sqrt{3} \pm 4}{2} = \sqrt{3} \pm 2.
\]

Since \(\tan 20^\circ\) is positive and less than \(\sqrt{3}\), we have \(\tan 20^\circ = \sqrt{3} - 2\). Therefore, \(\cot 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 20^\circ} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3} - 2} = -\sqrt{3} - 2\).

We also know that \(\tan 10^\circ = \tan (30^\circ - 20^\circ) = \frac{\tan 30^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 30^\circ \tan 20^\circ} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(\sqrt{3} - 2)} = \frac{\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} - \sqrt{3} + 2}{1 + 1 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{1 - 3 + 2\sqrt{3}}{\sqrt{3}}}{2 - \frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}} = \frac{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}}{\frac{2\sqrt{3} - 2}{\sqrt{3}}} = 1\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ = 1\), \(\cot^2 20^\circ = (-\sqrt{3} - 2)^2 = 3 + 4\sqrt{3} + 4 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\), and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \left(\frac{1}{\tan 40^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{\tan (60^\circ - 20^\circ)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\tan 60^\circ - \tan 20^\circ}{1 + \tan 60^\circ \tan 20^\circ}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{\sqrt{3} - (\sqrt{3} - 2)}{1 + \sqrt{3}(\sqrt{3} - 2)}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{1 + 3 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2}{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2 - \sqrt{3}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{2 + \sqrt{3}}{1}\right)^2 = (2 + \sqrt{3})^2 = 4 + 4\sqrt{3} + 3 = 7 + 4\sqrt{3}\).

Therefore, \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 1 + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) + (7 + 4\sqrt{3}) = 15 + 8\sqrt{3}\).

Finally, we substitute this back into the expression:

\[
3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + 15 + 8\sqrt{3} = 18 + 8\sqrt{3}.

"To determine the number of sides in a convex polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation with the given information:**
   We know that the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Let \(A\) be the measure of the missing interior angle. Therefore, the total sum of all interior angles is:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A
   \]

3. **Relate the total sum to the formula:**
   According to the formula, the total sum of the interior angles is also:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

4. **Set up the equation:**
   Equate the two expressions for the total sum:
   \[
   1070^\circ + A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(A\):**
   Since \(A\) is an interior angle of a convex polygon, it must be less than \(180^\circ\). We need to find \(n\) such that \(A\) is a valid angle.

6. **Isolate \(A\):**
   \[
   A = (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ
   \]

7. **Determine the range for \(A\):**
   Since \(0 < A < 180^\circ\), we set up the inequality:
   \[
   0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ
   \]

8. **Solve the inequality:**
   First, solve \(0 < (n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ\):
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   7.9444 < n
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \geq 8
   \]

   Next, solve \((n-2) \times 180^\circ - 1070^\circ < 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]
   Divide both sides by \(180^\circ\):
   \[
   n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify:
   \[
   n-2 < 6.9444
   \]
   Add 2 to both sides:
   \[
   n < 8.9444
   \]
   Since \(n\) must be an integer:
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

9. **Combine the results:**
   From both inequalities, we have:
   \[
   8 \leq n \leq 8
   \]
   Therefore, \(n = 8\).

Thus, the number of sides in the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To find the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we need to satisfy the equation:

\[ t(t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

First, expand the left side of the congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

We can solve this quadratic congruence using the quadratic formula, which is given by:

\[ t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

In our equation \( t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substitute these values into the quadratic formula:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} \]
\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} \]
\[ t = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) from 1 to 11 (since \( x^2 \equiv (23-x)^2 \pmod{23} \)):

\[ 1^2 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 2^2 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 3^2 \equiv 9 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 4^2 \equiv 16 \pmod{23} \]
\[ 5^2 \equiv 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( x = 5 \) or \( x = -5 \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \) or \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 18 \pmod{23} \).

Substitute these values back into the expression for \( t \):

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \equiv 17 \pmod{23} \]
\[ t = -1 + 18 = 17 \]
\[ t = -1 - 18 = -19 \equiv 4 \pmod{23} \]

The possible values for \( t \) are 4 and 17. Since we are asked to find the odd integer, we have:

\[ t = 17 \]

To verify, we check that \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23:

\[ t+2 = 17+2 = 19 \]
\[ 17 \cdot 19 = 323 \]
\[ 323 \div 23 = 14 \text{ remainder } 1 \]
\[ 323 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

The verification confirms that 17 is indeed the correct solution. Therefore, the odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the surface area of a cube with a volume of 1 cubic foot, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the side length of the cube.
2. Calculate the area of one face of the cube.
3. Multiply the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6 for a cube).

First, let's find the side length of the cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube is given by the formula:
\[ V = s^3 \]
where \( s \) is the side length. We know the volume is 1 cubic foot, so:
\[ s^3 = 1 \]
Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:
\[ s = 1 \text{ foot} \]

Next, we calculate the area of one face of the cube. Since each face of a cube is a square, the area \( A \) of one face is:
\[ A = s^2 \]
Substituting the side length we found:
\[ A = 1^2 = 1 \text{ square foot} \]

Finally, we find the total surface area of the cube by multiplying the area of one face by the number of faces (which is 6):
\[ \text{Surface Area} = 6 \times A = 6 \times 1 = 6 \text{ square feet} \]

Since the problem asks for the surface area in square inches, we need to convert square feet to square inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so there are \( 12^2 = 144 \) square inches in a square foot. Therefore, the surface area in square inches is:
\[ 6 \times 144 = 864 \text{ square inches} \]

Thus, the surface area of the cube is:

"要 find the product of the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) and its conjugate, we first need to identify the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\). The conjugate of a number \(a + b\sqrt{c}\) is \(a - b\sqrt{c}\). Therefore, the conjugate of \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) is \(5 - \sqrt{3}\).

Next, we multiply the number \(5 + \sqrt{3}\) by its conjugate \(5 - \sqrt{3}\):

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3})
\]

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\[
(5 + \sqrt{3})(5 - \sqrt{3}) = 5^2 - (\sqrt{3})^2
\]

Now, we calculate the squares:

\[
5^2 = 25
\]
\[
(\sqrt{3})^2 = 3

1. Evaluate \( f(5) \).
2. Subtract 1 from the result of \( f(5) \).
3. Evaluate \( g \) at the result obtained from step 2.

Let's start with step 1. The function \( f(x) \) is given by \( f(x) = 2x - 3 \). So, we substitute \( x = 5 \) into the function:
\[
f(5) = 2(5) - 3 = 10 - 3 = 7.

Next, we perform step 2. We need to subtract 1 from \( f(5) \):
\[
f(5) - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6.

Now, we move to step 3. We need to evaluate \( g \) at \( x = 6 \). The function \( g(x) \) is given by \( g(x) = x + 1 \). So, we substitute \( x = 6 \) into the function:

"To solve the equation \(\sin \left( \tan^{-1} (x) + \cot^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) \right) = \frac{1}{3}\), we start by using a known trigonometric identity. Specifically, we know that for any real number \(x \neq 0\),

\]
and
\[
\mathbf{r}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} + u \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -18 \\ -4 \end{pmatrix},

\[
d = \frac{\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\|}{\|\mathbf{b}\|},
\]
where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\) and the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\):
\[
\mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -9 \\ -2 \end{pmatrix},

\[
\mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix},

\[
\mathbf{a}_2 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}.

Next, we find the vector \(\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1\):
\[
\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1 = \begin{pmatrix} -5 \\ -3 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix} - \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ -10 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -5 - 3 \\ -3 + 10 \\ 6 - 1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -8 \\ 7 \\ 5 \end{pmatrix}.

Now, we compute the cross product \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):

Next, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b} \times (\mathbf{a}_2 - \mathbf{a}_1)\| = \sqrt{(-31)^2 + 6^2 + (-58)^2} = \sqrt{961 + 36 + 3364} = \sqrt{4361}.

Then, we find the magnitude of \(\mathbf{b}\):
\[
\|\mathbf{b}\| = \sqrt{2^2 + (-9)^2 + (-2)^2} = \sqrt{4 + 81 + 4} = \sqrt{89}.

Finally, we compute the distance \(d\):
\[

The \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}

and

\[

\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).

Substituting these values into the expression, we get:

\[

"To find the average price of the stamps from the 1970s that Juan has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of stamps from the 1970s for each country.
2. Determine the total number of stamps from the 1970s.
3. Calculate the total cost of these stamps.
4. Find the average price by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps.

From the table, we can see the number of stamps from the 1970s for each country:
- Brazil: 12 stamps
- France: 12 stamps
- Peru: 6 stamps
- Spain: 13 stamps

First, we calculate the total number of stamps from the 1970s:
\[ 12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \]

Next, we calculate the total cost of these stamps. The prices are:
- Brazil: 6 cents per stamp
- France: 4 cents per stamp
- Peru: 5 cents per stamp
- Spain: 5 cents per stamp

So, the total cost is:
\[ 12 \times 6 + 12 \times 4 + 6 \times 5 + 13 \times 5 \]

We calculate each term separately:
\[ 12 \times 6 = 72 \]
\[ 12 \times 4 = 48 \]
\[ 6 \times 5 = 30 \]
\[ 13 \times 5 = 65 \]

Now, we add these amounts together to get the total cost:
\[ 72 + 48 + 30 + 65 = 215 \]

Finally, we find the average price by dividing the total cost by the total number of stamps:
\[ \frac{215}{43} \approx 5.0 \]

Therefore, the average price of the stamps from the 1970s is \(\boxed{5.0}\) cents.","[5.00000000000000, '5.0']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the sides as follows:
- \(AD = a\)
- \(BC = b\)
- \(CD = c\)
- \(AC = d\)

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) share the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Let this height be \(h\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (AD + BC) \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
Thus,
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Next, we consider the area of \(\triangle ACD\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle with base \(CD = c\) and height \(AC = d\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

We need to find the relationship between \(d\) and \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) have the same height from \(C\) to \(AD\). Therefore, the height \(h\) of the trapezoid is the same as the height of \(\triangle ACD\).

Now, we use the fact that \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\). This implies that \(\triangle ACD\) is a right triangle, and we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\). However, we can also use the angle bisector property to find a simpler relationship.

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(\triangle ACD\) are proportional to their bases \(BC\) and \(AD\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ABC]}{[\triangle ACD]} = \frac{BC}{AD} = \frac{b}{a}
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times BC \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times CD \times AC = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) can also be expressed in terms of \(d\) and \(h\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

Given that \(\overline{AC}\) is perpendicular to \(\overline{CD}\), we can use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the rectangle formed by \(CD\) and \(AC\). Therefore, we have:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times d = \frac{1}{2} \times c \times h
\]

Finally, we use the fact that the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times 42 = 21
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

" start with the given equation:

\[
\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}
\]

To eliminate the square roots, we can square both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we can eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x-1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

Then, we divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation, we get:

First, we substitute the values into the formula:
\[
\frac{7}{30} @ \frac{10}{21} = (7)(10)\left(\frac{21}{30}\right)
\]

Next, we perform the multiplication of the integers and the fraction:
\[
(7)(10) = 70
\]
\[
70 \left(\frac{21}{30}\right) = 70 \cdot \frac{21}{30}
\]

We can simplify the multiplication by canceling out the common factor between 70 and 30. The greatest common divisor of 70 and 30 is 10, so we can rewrite the expression as:
\[
70 \cdot \frac{21}{30} = \frac{70 \cdot 21}{30} = \frac{7 \cdot 10 \cdot 21}{3 \cdot 10} = \frac{7 \cdot 21}{3}

"要 find the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently on the circumference of a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) to intersect, the points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) must be arranged such that one pair of points (say \(A\) and \(B\)) are on one side of the circle and the other pair (say \(C\) and \(D\)) are on the other side. This means that if we list the points in order around the circle, they must alternate.

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence. However, since the points are on a circle, we need to account for the fact that rotating the points does not create a new arrangement. Therefore, we divide by 4 to account for these rotations. Additionally, we need to divide by 2 because the circle can be traversed in two directions (clockwise and counterclockwise). Thus, the total number of distinct arrangements of the points is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4 \times 2} = \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]
   These 3 distinct arrangements are: \(ABCD\), \(ACBD\), and \(ADBC\).

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: Out of these 3 distinct arrangements, only one arrangement (\(ACBD\)) has the points alternating, which means that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect. Therefore, there is only 1 favorable arrangement.

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct arrangements:

"To solve the problem, we need to find the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in degrees. Let's start by calculating the areas of the circles and the shaded region.

The area of the larger circle with radius 2 is:
\[
\text{Area of the larger circle} = \pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]
The area of the smaller circle with radius 1 is:
\[
\text{Area of the smaller circle} = \pi \times 1^2 = \pi
\]
According to the problem, the total area of the shaded region is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. Therefore, the area of the shaded region is:
\[
\text{Area of the shaded region} = \frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
The shaded region consists of a sector of the smaller circle and a sector of the larger circle. Let \(\theta\) be the measure of the angle \(\angle ADC\) in radians. The area of the sector of the smaller circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the smaller circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times \pi = \frac{\theta}{2}
\]
The area of the sector of the larger circle is:
\[
\text{Area of the sector of the larger circle} = \frac{\theta}{2\pi} \times 4\pi = 2\theta

The total area of the shaded region is the sum of the areas of these two sectors:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} + 2\theta = \frac{\theta}{2} + \frac{4\theta}{2} = \frac{5\theta}{2}
\]
We know that this total area is equal to \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\), so we can set up the equation:
\[
\frac{5\theta}{2} = \frac{5\pi}{3}
\]
To solve for \(\theta\), we can divide both sides of the equation by 5:
\[
\frac{\theta}{2} = \frac{\pi}{3}
\]
Then, we multiply both sides by 2:
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3}

The angle \(\theta\) is in radians. To convert this angle to degrees, we use the conversion factor \(\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}\):
\[
\theta = \frac{2\pi}{3} \times \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{2 \times 180^\circ}{3} = 120^\circ

"To determine how many conical mugs are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the conical mug and the spherical tank and then find the ratio of the volume of the tank to the volume of the mug.

First, let's calculate the volume of the conical mug. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a cone is:
\[
V_{\text{cone}} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone. For the conical mug, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a sphere is:
\[
V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3
\]
where \( r \) is the radius of the sphere. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

Now, we need to find out how many conical mugs are required to fill the spherical tank. This is done by dividing the volume of the spherical tank by the volume of the conical mug:
\[
\text{Number of mugs} = \frac{V_{\text{sphere}}}{V_{\text{cone}}} = \frac{288 \pi}{24 \pi} = \frac{288}{24} = 12

This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\), and both \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are angles in the interval \([- \frac{\pi}{2}, \frac{\pi}{2}]\).

We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\). Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta,
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta.

Therefore,
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta).
\]
This expression is a difference of squares:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2.
\]
We know that \(\sin^2 \theta + \cos^2 \theta = 1\) for any angle \(\theta\). Thus, \(\cos^2 \alpha = 1 - \sin^2 \alpha = 1 - 0.4^2 = 1 - 0.16 = 0.84\) and \(\cos^2 \beta = 1 - \sin^2 \beta = 1 - 0.5^2 = 1 - 0.25 = 0.75\). Substituting these values in, we get:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = (0.4 \cdot \sqrt{0.75})^2 - (\sqrt{0.84} \cdot 0.5)^2 = 0.4^2 \cdot 0.75 - 0.5^2 \cdot 0.84 = 0.16 \cdot 0.75 - 0.25 \cdot 0.84.

"To determine the number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from a committee of 8 rationalists and 6 Democrats, with the condition that the subcommittee must include at least one member from each group, we can use the principle of complementary counting. This involves calculating the total number of ways to form the subcommittee and then subtracting the number of ways to form a subcommittee that does not meet the condition (i.e., a subcommittee consisting only of rationalists or only of Democrats).

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a subcommittee of 5 members from the 14 members (8 rationalists and 6 Democrats). This is given by the combination formula \(\binom{n}{k}\), which represents the number of ways to choose \(k\) elements from a set of \(n\) elements without regard to the order of selection.

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a subcommittee consisting only of rationalists. This is the number of ways to choose 5 rationalists from the 8 rationalists:

\[

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[

"Given that \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles with \( AB = AC \) and the altitude \( AM = 11 \), we need to find the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) given that there is a point \( D \) on \( \overline{AM} \) such that \( AD = 10 \) and \( \angle BDC = 3\angle BAC \).

First, let's denote \( \angle BAC = \theta \). Since \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles, \( \angle ABC = \angle ACB = \frac{180^\circ - \theta}{2} \).

Since \( D \) is on \( AM \) and \( AD = 10 \), it follows that \( DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1 \). We need to use the given condition \( \angle BDC = 3\theta \).

Using the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle BDC \), we have:
\[
BC^2 = BD^2 + CD^2 - 2 \cdot BD \cdot CD \cdot \cos(\angle BDC)
\]
Since \( BD = CD \) (because \( \triangle ABC \) is isosceles and \( D \) is on the altitude), let \( BD = CD = x \). Then:
\[
BC^2 = x^2 + x^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \cos(3\theta) = 2x^2 (1 - \cos(3\theta))
\]
Using the triple angle identity for cosine, \( \cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta) \), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 2x^2 (1 - (4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta))) = 2x^2 (1 - 4\cos^3(\theta) + 3\cos(\theta)) = 2x^2 (4\cos(\theta) - 4\cos^3(\theta)) = 8x^2 \cos(\theta) (1 - \cos^2(\theta)) = 8x^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)
\]
Thus,
\[
BC = x \sqrt{8 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)} = 2x \sin(\theta) \sqrt{2 \cos(\theta)}
\]

Next, we use the Law of Cosines in \( \triangle ABD \) to find \( x \):
\[
BD^2 = AB^2 + AD^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot AD \cdot \cos(\angle BAD)
\]
Since \( AB = AC \) and \( \angle BAD = \frac{\theta}{2} \), we have:
\[
x^2 = AB^2 + 10^2 - 2 \cdot AB \cdot 10 \cdot \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Let \( AB = AC = y \). Then:
\[
x^2 = y^2 + 100 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

We also know that in \( \triangle AMC \), by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
AC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 \implies y^2 = 11^2 + \left(\frac{BC}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + \left(\frac{2x \sin(\theta) \sqrt{2 \cos(\theta)}}{2}\right)^2 = 121 + x^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cdot 2 \cos(\theta)
\]
Thus,
\[
y^2 = 121 + 2x^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta)
\]

We now have two equations:
1. \( x^2 = y^2 + 100 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) \)
2. \( y^2 = 121 + 2x^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta) \)

Substituting \( y^2 \) from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[
x^2 = 121 + 2x^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta) + 100 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
\[
x^2 = 221 + 2x^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta) - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
x^2 - 2x^2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 221 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
\[
x^2 (1 - 2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta)) = 221 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]

Using the identity \( \sin^2(\theta) = 1 - \cos^2(\theta) \), we have:
\[
1 - 2 \sin^2(\theta) \cos(\theta) = 1 - 2 (1 - \cos^2(\theta)) \cos(\theta) = 1 - 2 \cos(\theta) + 2 \cos^3(\theta) = 2 \cos^3(\theta) - 2 \cos(\theta) = 2 \cos(\theta) (\cos^2(\theta) - 1) = -2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)
\]
Thus,
\[
x^2 (-2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)) = 221 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
\[
-2x^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 221 - 20y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right)
\]
\[
x^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 10y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 110.5
\]

From the earlier equation \( BC = 2x \sin(\theta) \sqrt{2 \cos(\theta)} \), we have:
\[
BC^2 = 8x^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta)
\]
Substituting \( x^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 10y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 110.5 \), we get:
\[
BC^2 = 8 (10y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 110.5) = 80y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 884
\]

We also know that \( BC = 2x \sin(\theta) \sqrt{2 \cos(\theta)} \), so:
\[
BC^2 = (2x \sin(\theta) \sqrt{2 \cos(\theta)})^2 = 8x^2 \cos(\theta) \sin^2(\theta) = 8 (10y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 110.5) = 80y \cos\left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 884
\]

By solving these equations, we find that \( y = 11 \sqrt{5} \) and \( x = 11 \). Therefore, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:
\[
AB + AC + BC = 11\sqrt{5} + 11\sqrt{5} + 2 \cdot 11 \cdot \sin(\theta) \sqrt{2 \cos(\theta)} = 22\sqrt{5} + 22 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} \cdot \sqrt{2} = 22\sqrt{5} + 22 = 22(\sqrt{5} + 1)

Thus, the perimeter of \( \triangle ABC \) is:

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the 27 integers is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median of these 27 integers is \(\boxed{81}\).","[81, '81']",81,"[81, '81']",True
"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\). This means that \(x^4 + 4x^2\) is always greater than \(-4\) for all real numbers \(x\). Thus, the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true.

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, let's make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:
\[ y^2 + 4y < 21 \]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0 \]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic equation:
\[ y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0 \]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:
\[ y + 7 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad y - 3 = 0 \]
\[ y = -7 \quad \text{or} \quad y = 3 \]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) can be analyzed by testing intervals determined by the critical point \(y = 3\). The intervals to test are \( (-\infty, 0] \) and \( [0, 3) \).

- For \(y \in (-\infty, 0]\), choose \(y = 0\):
  \[ 0^2 + 4(0) - 21 = -21 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \(y \in [0, 3)\), choose \(y = 1\):
  \[ 1^2 + 4(1) - 21 = 1 + 4 - 21 = -16 < 0 \]
  This interval satisfies the inequality.

- For \(y \in (3, \infty)\), choose \(y = 4\):
  \[ 4^2 + 4(4) - 21 = 16 + 16 - 21 = 11 > 0 \]
  This interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Thus, the solution to the inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) is:
\[ 0 \leq y < 3 \]

Recall that \(y = x^2\), so we convert back to \(x\):
\[ 0 \leq x^2 < 3 \]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we get:
\[ -\sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3} \]

Combining the results from both steps, the values of \(x\) that satisfy the original inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) are:

"Given the equations:
\[

\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12,
\]
we need to find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\).

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the sum of the product of the variables taken two at a time:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3xyz.
\]
Substituting the given values \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) and \(xyz = 4\) into this identity, we get:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 3 \cdot 4,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
12 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx) - 12,
\]
or
\[
24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx).
\]

Now we have two equations:
1. \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\),
2. \(24 = (x+y+z)(xy + yz + zx)\).

Let \(s = x+y+z\) and \(p = xy + yz + zx\). Then the equations become:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
24 = sp.
\]
From the second equation, we can express \(p\) in terms of \(s\):
\[
p = \frac{24}{s}.
\]
Substituting this into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right),
\]
or
\[
-8 = s^3 - 72.
\]
Solving for \(s^3\), we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]
Substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(p = \frac{24}{s}\), we get:
\[
p = \frac{24}{4} = 6.

"To determine which grade has the number of male swimmers closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female swimmers, we need to calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female swimmers for each grade and then compare it to the number of male swimmers in that grade.

First, let's calculate \(135\%\) of the number of female swimmers for each grade. Since there are 300 female swimmers in each grade, we have:
\[ 135\% \text{ of } 300 = 1.35 \times 300 = 405 \]

Now, we compare the number of male swimmers in each grade to 405:

1. For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) grade:
   - Number of male swimmers: \(41.1\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.411 \times 300 = 123.3\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 123.3 = 281.7\)

2. For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) grade:
   - Number of male swimmers: \(34.4\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.344 \times 300 = 103.2\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 103.2 = 301.8\)

3. For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) grade:
   - Number of male swimmers: \(20.6\% \text{ of } 300 = 0.206 \times 300 = 61.8\)
   - Difference from 405: \(405 - 61.8 = 343.2\)

The smallest difference is 281.7, which corresponds to the \(9^{\text{th}}\) grade. Therefore, the number of male swimmers in the \(9^{\text{th}}\) grade is closest to \(135\%\) of the number of female swimmers.

"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x-9)(x+9).\]
Thus, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x-9)(x+9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x-9)(x+9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x-9)(x+9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x-9)(x+9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x-36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are negative, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since both \(x\) and \(x-36\) are negative). Thus, the quotient is:

   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is positive (since \(x\) is negative and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} > 0.\]
   So, the inequality is not satisfied in this interval.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x-9\) is negative and \(x+9\) is positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is negative. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:
   \[\frac{-(x-9)(x+9)}{x(x-36)} < 0.\]
   So, the inequality is satisfied in this interval.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), both \(x-9\) and \(x+9\) are positive, so \((x-9)(x+9)\) is positive. Therefore, \(|x^2 - 81| = (x-9)(x+9)\). The denominator \(x(x-36)\) is negative (since \(x\) is positive and \(x-36\) is negative). Thus, the quotient is:

"To find the maximum area of the rectangular field enclosed by the mathematically-shaped fence, we start by analyzing the given information. The fence consists of two straight sides of the rectangle and two semicircles, each with a radius equal to half the width of the rectangle. Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( L \) and the width by \( W \). The radius of each semicircle is therefore \( \frac{W}{2} \).

The total length of the fence is given by the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumferences of the two semicircles. The circumference of one semicircle is \( \pi \times \frac{W}{2} = \frac{\pi W}{2} \), so the total circumference of the two semicircles is \( 2 \times \frac{\pi W}{2} = \pi W \). Therefore, the total length of the fence is:
\[
L + L + \pi W = 2L + \pi W
\]
We know that the total length of the fence is 400 meters, so we can write the equation:
\[
2L + \pi W = 400
\]
Solving for \( L \) in terms of \( W \), we get:
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi W}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangular field is given by the product of its length and width:
\[
A = L \times W = \left( \frac{400 - \pi W}{2} \right) W = \frac{400W - \pi W^2}{2} = 200W - \frac{\pi W^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we need to take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( W \) and set it equal to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dW} = 200 - \pi W = 0
\]
Solving for \( W \), we get:
\[
\pi W = 200 \implies W = \frac{200}{\pi}

Next, we substitute \( W = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( L \):
\[
L = \frac{400 - \pi \left( \frac{200}{\pi} \right)}{2} = \frac{400 - 200}{2} = \frac{200}{2} = 100

A = 100 \times \frac{200}{\pi} = \frac{20000}{\pi}

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[

Next, expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out the common term \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum value of \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

The final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root.

Finally, let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]

"Given that the distances from point \( P \) to five of the vertices of a regular octahedron are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11, we need to find the distance from \( P \) to the sixth vertex. Let's denote the vertices of the octahedron as \( A, B, C, D, E, F \) such that \( A, B, C, D \) form a square in the \( xy \)-plane and \( E \) and \( F \) are the vertices above and below the center of the square, respectively. Without loss of generality, we can place the vertices as follows:
\[ A = (1, 1, 0), \quad B = (-1, 1, 0), \quad C = (-1, -1, 0), \quad D = (1, -1, 0), \quad E = (0, 0, 1), \quad F = (0, 0, -1). \]

Let the coordinates of point \( P \) be \( (x, y, z) \). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given by:
\[ PA = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}, \]
\[ PB = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y-1)^2 + z^2}, \]
\[ PC = \sqrt{(x+1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2}, \]
\[ PD = \sqrt{(x-1)^2 + (y+1)^2 + z^2}, \]
\[ PE = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z-1)^2}, \]
\[ PF = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z+1)^2}. \]

We are given that these distances are 3, 7, 8, 9, and 11. We need to find the sixth distance. To do this, we will use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. This constant can be calculated as follows:

"To determine the ratio of the acceleration of the ball that Jin throws to the acceleration of the ball that Jake throws, we start with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force \( F \) is equal to the mass \( m \) multiplied by the acceleration \( a \). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Since Jin wants to throw the ball with the same force as Jake, the forces acting on both balls are equal. Let's denote the mass of the ball that Jin throws as \( m_J \) and the mass of the ball that Jake throws as \( m_K \). Similarly, let's denote the acceleration of the ball that Jin throws as \( a_J \) and the acceleration of the ball that Jake throws as \( a_K \). According to Newton's second law, we have:

\[ F_J = m_J \cdot a_J \]
\[ F_K = m_K \cdot a_K \]

Since the forces are equal, we can set the two equations equal to each other:

\[ m_J \cdot a_J = m_K \cdot a_K \]

We are given the masses of the balls: \( m_J = 200 \) grams and \( m_K = 150 \) grams. Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_J = 150 \cdot a_K \]

To find the ratio of the acceleration of the ball that Jin throws to the acceleration of the ball that Jake throws, we solve for \( \frac{a_J}{a_K} \):

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150}{200} \]

We can simplify this fraction by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor, which is 50:

\[ \frac{a_J}{a_K} = \frac{150 \div 50}{200 \div 50} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of the acceleration of the ball that Jin throws to the acceleration of the ball that Jake throws is:

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1556_7\).

**Step 2: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 8.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 8 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 8 = 78 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5
\]
\[
78 \div 8 = 9 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
9 \div 8 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]
\[
1 \div 8 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 1
\]

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get \(629_{10} = 1165_8\).

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The digits in \(1556_7\) are 1, 5, 5, and 6.
The digits in \(1165_8\) are 1, 1, 6, and 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Each of these digits appears at least once in both representations.

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

There are 3 common digits: 1, 5, and 6.

Thus, the number of digits that are the same in the representations of \(629_{10}\) in base 7 and base 8 is \(\boxed{3}\).","[3, '3']",3,"[3, '3']",True

2. Each sheep shakes hands with each goat, but no sheep shakes hands with another sheep, and no goat shakes hands with another goat.

This means that each of the 6 sheep will shake hands with each of the 10 goats. Therefore, the total number of handshakes can be calculated by multiplying the number of sheep by the number of goats:

"为了 find the sum of the coefficients of the polynomial \( g(x) \), we start by expressing \( g(x) \) in terms of \( f(x) \). Given that \( g(x) = f(x-1) \), we substitute \( x-1 \) for \( x \) in the polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:

\[ g(x) = f(x-1) = 3(x-1)^4 + 5(x-1)^2 - 9(x-1) - 2. \]

To find the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \), we evaluate \( g(x) \) at \( x = 1 \). This is because the sum of the coefficients of a polynomial \( p(x) \) is equal to \( p(1) \). Therefore, we need to compute \( g(1) \):

\[ g(1) = f(1-1) = f(0). \]

Now, we substitute \( x = 0 \) into the original polynomial \( f(x) \):

\[ f(0) = 3(0)^4 + 5(0)^2 - 9(0) - 2 = -2. \]

Thus, the sum of the coefficients of \( g(x) \) is:

"To find the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\), we can use the formula for the distance from a point to a line. The formula for the distance \(d\) from a point \((x_1, y_1)\) to a line \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is given by:

\[
d = \frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}
\]

First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\). By subtracting \(2x\) from both sides, we get:

\[
-2x + y + 2 = 0
\]

Here, \(A = -2\), \(B = 1\), and \(C = 2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Substituting these values into the distance formula, we have:

\[
d = \frac{|-2(6) + 1(0) + 2|}{\sqrt{(-2)^2 + 1^2}} = \frac{|-12 + 0 + 2|}{\sqrt{4 + 1}} = \frac{|-10|}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}
\]

To simplify \(\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}}\), we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by \(\sqrt{5}\):

\[
\frac{10}{\sqrt{5}} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{5}} = \frac{10\sqrt{5}}{5} = 2\sqrt{5}

Therefore, the shortest distance from the point \((6, 0)\) to the line \(y = 2x - 2\) is \(\boxed{2\sqrt{5}}\).","[2*sqrt(5), '2\\sqrt{5}']",2\sqrt{5},"[2, '2']",True
"To solve for the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) where \(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \alpha_3, \alpha_4\) are the roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we start by using Vieta's formulas. Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -a_3,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = -a_1,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = a_0.
\]

For the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\), we have \(a_3 = 2\), \(a_2 = 0\), \(a_1 = 0\), and \(a_0 = 2\). Therefore, Vieta's formulas give us:

\[
\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 + \alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = 0,

\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2.
\]

We need to find the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\). Let's denote these expressions by \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) respectively. Then we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = 0.
\]

We also know that:

\[
(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2)(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4) = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]

Let \(\alpha_1 + \alpha_2 = a\) and \(\alpha_3 + \alpha_4 = b\). Then \(a + b = -2\) and:

\[
ab = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4.
\]

From the equation \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\), we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = ab + S_3 = 0 \implies S_3 = -ab.
\]

We also know that:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2)(\alpha_3\alpha_4) = 2.
\]

Let \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 = c\) and \(\alpha_3\alpha_4 = d\). Then \(cd = 2\). Since \(S_1 = \alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4 = c + d\) and \(S_2 = \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4 + \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3 = ab - S_3 = ab + ab = 2ab\), we have:

\[
S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = c + d + 2ab = 0.
\]

Since \(ab = -c - d\), we substitute \(ab\) into the equation:

\[
c + d + 2(-c - d) = 0 \implies c + d - 2c - 2d = 0 \implies -c - d = 0 \implies c + d = 0.
\]

Therefore, \(S_1 = c + d = 0\). Since \(cd = 2\), the possible pairs \((c, d)\) are \((\sqrt{2}, -\sqrt{2})\) and \((- \sqrt{2}, \sqrt{2})\). This means that \(S_1 = 0\), \(S_2 = 2ab = 2(-c - d) = 2 \cdot 0 = 0\), and \(S_3 = -ab = -(-c - d) = c + d = 0\). However, this is not possible since \(S_2\) and \(S_3\) must be distinct. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the roots.

The roots of the polynomial \(x^4 + 2x^3 + 2 = 0\) are \(\alpha_1 = -1 + i\), \(\alpha_2 = -1 - i\), \(\alpha_3 = 1 + i\), and \(\alpha_4 = 1 - i\). Then:

\[
\alpha_1\alpha_2 = (-1 + i)(-1 - i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 + 1 = 2,
\]
\[
\alpha_3\alpha_4 = (1 + i)(1 - i) = 1 - i^2 = 1 + 1 = 2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_3 = (-1 + i)(1 + i) = -1 - i + i - i^2 = -1 + 1 = 0,
\]
\[
\alpha_2\alpha_4 = (-1 - i)(1 - i) = -1 + i - i + i^2 = -1 - 1 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_1\alpha_4 = (-1 + i)(1 - i) = -1 + i - i + i^2 = -1 - 1 = -2,
\]
\[
\alpha_2\alpha_3 = (-1 - i)(1 + i) = -1 - i + i - i^2 = -1 + 1 = 0.

Therefore, the values of \(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4\), \(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4\), and \(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\) are \(2 + 2 = 4\), \(0 - 2 = -2\), and \(0 - 2 = -2\). The set is:

2. Five red pens and four black pens cost \$1.82:

To eliminate \( b \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[ (5r + 4b) - (3r + 4b) = 1.82 - 1.24 \]
\[ 2r = 0.58 \]
\[ r = \frac{0.58}{2} \]
\[ r = 0.29 \]

So, the cost of a red pen is \( 0.29 \) dollars. To convert this to cents, we multiply by 100:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with center \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume \(AB = 2a\) and \(AD = 2b\). Therefore, the vertices of the rectangle are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

A point \(P = (x, y)\) inside the rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex if the distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is less than the distance from \(P\) to any of the vertices. The distance from \(P\) to \(O\) is given by:
\[
d(P, O) = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from \(P\) to vertex \(A\) is:
\[
d(P, A) = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need \(d(P, O) < d(P, A)\):
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots, we get:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding both sides:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Similarly, we need \(d(P, O) < d(P, B)\), \(d(P, O) < d(P, C)\), and \(d(P, O) < d(P, D)\). These inequalities are:
\[
ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

Combining these inequalities, we get the region inside the rectangle where \(P\) is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex:
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a} < x < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2a}
\]
\[
-\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b} < y < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2b}
\]

These inequalities describe a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{a}\) and \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{b}\).

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{a^2 + b^2}{a} \times \frac{a^2 + b^2}{b} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 2a \times 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point inside the original rectangle is closer to \(O\) than to any vertex is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{ab}}{4ab} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2}
\]

Simplifying the expression:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4 + 2a^2b^2 + b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^4}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{2a^2b^2}{4a^2b^2} + \frac{b^4}{4a^2b^2} = \frac{a^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4a^2}
\]

Given that \(AB/AD = k\), we have \(a/b = k\). Substituting \(a = kb\) into the expression:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(kb)^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4(kb)^2} = \frac{k^2b^2}{4b^2} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{b^2}{4k^2b^2} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4k^2}
\]

Combining the terms:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{k^2}{4} + \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4k^2} = \frac{k^2 + 2 + \frac{1}{k^2}}{4}
\]

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also equal \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, we substitute \( n = 7 \) back into the magic square and check the sums of the rows, columns, and diagonals:

Now, let's check the sums:

The length of the diagonal of a rectangle can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the diagonal in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the length and the width of the rectangle).

The length of the diagonal \(d\) is given by:
\[ d = \sqrt{\text{length}^2 + \text{width}^2} \]

Substituting the given values (length = 400 feet and width = 300 feet):
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} \]
\[ d = \sqrt{250000} \]
\[ d = 500 \text{ feet} \]

So, Jim walks 500 feet.

Next, let's calculate the distance Martha covers. Martha walks along the length and the width of the rectangle. The total distance she covers is the sum of the length and the width:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{length} + \text{width} \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 400 + 300 \]
\[ \text{Distance} = 700 \text{ feet} \]

So, Martha walks 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference in the distances they cover:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Distance Martha covers} - \text{Distance Jim covers} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 700 - 500 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, Jim walks \(\boxed{200}\) feet less than Martha.","[200, '200']",200,"[200, '200']",True
"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.
\]

So the expression simplifies to:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{1}{1} = 1.
\]

Therefore, the only possible value of the given expression is \(\boxed{1}\).","[1, '1']",1,"[1, '1']",True
"To determine the shortest distance possible if we start from any point \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\) and visit the other three points exactly once, we need to calculate the total distance for each possible route and then find the minimum of these distances.

Let's calculate the distance for each route:

1. Starting from \(A\):
   - Route \(A \to B \to C \to D\): \(AB + BC + CD = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
   - Route \(A \to B \to D \to C\): \(AB + BD + DC = 6 + 3 + 4 = 13\)
   - Route \(A \to C \to B \to D\): \(AC + CB + BD = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
   - Route \(A \to C \to D \to B\): \(AC + CD + DB = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13\)
   - Route \(A \to D \to B \to C\): \(AD + DB + BC = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - Route \(A \to D \to C \to B\): \(AD + DC + CB = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)

   The minimum distance starting from \(A\) is 13.

2. Starting from \(B\):
   - Route \(B \to A \to C \to D\): \(BA + AC + CD = 6 + 6 + 4 = 16\)
   - Route \(B \to A \to D \to C\): \(BA + AD + DC = 6 + 5 + 4 = 15\)
   - Route \(B \to C \to A \to D\): \(BC + CA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Route \(B \to C \to D \to A\): \(BC + CD + DA = 5 + 4 + 5 = 14\)
   - Route \(B \to D \to A \to C\): \(BD + DA + AC = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - Route \(B \to D \to C \to A\): \(BD + DC + CA = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13\)

   The minimum distance starting from \(B\) is 13.

3. Starting from \(C\):
   - Route \(C \to A \to B \to D\): \(CA + AB + BD = 6 + 6 + 3 = 15\)
   - Route \(C \to A \to D \to B\): \(CA + AD + DB = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14\)
   - Route \(C \to B \to A \to D\): \(CB + BA + AD = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Route \(C \to B \to D \to A\): \(CB + BD + DA = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13\)
   - Route \(C \to D \to A \to B\): \(CD + DA + AB = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
   - Route \(C \to D \to B \to A\): \(CD + DB + BA = 4 + 3 + 6 = 13\)

   The minimum distance starting from \(C\) is 13.

4. Starting from \(D\):
   - Route \(D \to A \to B \to C\): \(DA + AB + BC = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to A \to C \to B\): \(DA + AC + CB = 5 + 6 + 5 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to B \to A \to C\): \(DB + BA + AC = 3 + 6 + 6 = 15\)
   - Route \(D \to B \to C \to A\): \(DB + BC + CA = 3 + 5 + 6 = 14\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to A \to B\): \(DC + CA + AB = 4 + 6 + 6 = 16\)
   - Route \(D \to C \to B \to A\): \(DC + CB + BA = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15\)
