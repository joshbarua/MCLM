"To find the length of \(DE\) in the given right triangle \(DEF\), we start by identifying the given information and the relationships between the sides and angles.

We know:
- \(\sin D = 0.7\)
- \(EF = 7\)

Since \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can use the definition of sine in a right triangle:
\[
\sin D = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]
In triangle \(DEF\), the side opposite angle \(D\) is \(EF\) and the hypotenuse is \(DF\). Therefore, we have:
\[
\sin D = \frac{EF}{DF} = \frac{7}{DF}
\]
Given that \(\sin D = 0.7\), we can set up the equation:
\[
0.7 = \frac{7}{DF}
\]

To solve for \(DF\), we multiply both sides of the equation by \(DF\):
\[
0.7 \cdot DF = 7
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 0.7:
\[
DF = \frac{7}{0.7} = 10
\]

Now that we have the length of the hypotenuse \(DF\), we need to find the length of \(DE\). Since \(DEF\) is a right triangle, we can use the Pythagorean theorem:
\[
DF^2 = DE^2 + EF^2
\]

Substituting the known values \(DF = 10\) and \(EF = 7\):
\[
10^2 = DE^2 + 7^2
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
100 = DE^2 + 49
\]

Subtract 49 from both sides to solve for \(DE^2\):
\[
DE^2 = 100 - 49 = 51
\]

Finally, take the square root of both sides to find \(DE\):
\[
DE = \sqrt{51}
\]

Thus, the length of \(DE\) is:
\[
\boxed{\sqrt{51}}

"To find the complex number \( w \) after rotating \( z \) around \( c \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise, we can follow these steps:

1. **Translate \( z \) so that \( c \) is at the origin:**
   \[
   z' = z - c
   \]
   Given \( z = 2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   z' = (2 + \sqrt{2} - (3 + 3\sqrt{2})i) - (2 - 3i) = \sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i
   \]

2. **Rotate \( z' \) by \( \frac{\pi}{4} \) counterclockwise:**
   Multiplying \( z' \) by \( e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} \) (which is \( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \)) gives:
   \[
   z'' = z' \cdot e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}} = (\sqrt{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i) \left( \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i \right)
   \]
   Using the distributive property (FOIL method):
   \[
   z'' = \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + \sqrt{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} - 3\sqrt{2}i \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}i

   Simplifying each term:
   \[
   z'' = 1 + i - 3i + 3 = 4 - 2i
   \]

3. **Translate \( z'' \) back to the original position:**
   \[
   w = z'' + c
   \]
   Given \( z'' = 4 - 2i \) and \( c = 2 - 3i \), we have:
   \[
   w = (4 - 2i) + (2 - 3i) = 6 - 5i

Therefore, the complex number \( w \) is \(\boxed{6 - 5i}\).","[-1*5*i + 6, '6 - 5i']",6 - 5i,"[5, '5']",True
"To simplify \(\sqrt{242}\), we start by finding the prime factorization of 242. We can see that 242 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:

\[242 \div 2 = 121\]

So, we can write:

\[242 = 2 \times 121\]

Next, we need to factorize 121. We know that 121 is a perfect square, and it is equal to \(11 \times 11\):

\[121 = 11 \times 11\]

Therefore, the prime factorization of 242 is:

\[242 = 2 \times 11 \times 11\]

Now, we can use the property of square roots that states \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\). Applying this property, we get:

\[\sqrt{242} = \sqrt{2 \times 11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times \sqrt{11 \times 11} = \sqrt{2} \times 11 = 11\sqrt{2}\]

Thus, the simplified form of \(\sqrt{242}\) is:

"To determine the number of ways Kuina monella can arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together, we can follow these steps:

1. **Treat Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas as a single unit**: Since Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas want to sit together, we can consider them as a single ""block"" or ""unit"". This reduces the problem to arranging 6 units (the block of 3 people and the other 5 individuals) around a circular table.

2. **Arrange the 6 units in a circle**: The number of ways to arrange \( n \) units in a circle is \((n-1)!\). Here, \( n = 6 \), so the number of ways to arrange the 6 units is \((6-1)! = 5! = 120\).

3. **Arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block**: Within the block, Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas can be arranged in \(3!\) (3 factorial) ways. This is because there are 3 choices for who sits in the first seat, 2 choices for who sits in the second seat, and 1 choice for who sits in the third seat. So, \(3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6\).

4. **Combine the two results**: The total number of ways to arrange the 8 people around the table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is the product of the number of ways to arrange the 6 units and the number of ways to arrange Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas within their block. Therefore, the total number of arrangements is \(120 \times 6 = 720\).

Thus, the number of ways Kuina monella can arrange 8 people around a circular table such that Pierre, Rosa, and Thomas all sit together is \(\boxed{720}\).","[720, '720']",720,"[720, '720']",True
"To find the constant term in the expansion of \(\left(10x^3 - \frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^5\), we use the Binomial Theorem. The Binomial Theorem states that:

\[
(a + b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k
\]

In this problem, \(a = 10x^3\), \(b = -\frac{1}{2x^2}\), and \(n = 5\). The general term in the expansion is given by:

\[
\binom{5}{k} (10x^3)^{5-k} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k
\]

We need to find the value of \(k\) for which the term is a constant. This means that the exponent of \(x\) in the term must be zero. Let's calculate the exponent of \(x\) in the general term:

\[
(10x^3)^{5-k} = 10^{5-k} x^{3(5-k)} = 10^{5-k} x^{15-3k}
\]
\[
\left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^k = (-1)^k \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^k x^{-2k} = (-1)^k \frac{1}{2^k} x^{-2k}
\]

Combining these, the exponent of \(x\) in the general term is:

\[
15 - 3k - 2k = 15 - 5k
\]

We set this equal to zero to find the value of \(k\):

\[
15 - 5k = 0
\]
\[
5k = 15
\]
\[
k = 3
\]

Now, we substitute \(k = 3\) back into the general term to find the constant term:

\[
\binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^{5-3} \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3 = \binom{5}{3} (10x^3)^2 \left(-\frac{1}{2x^2}\right)^3

\[

\[

"Given that \( n \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), we need to find the remainder when \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \) is divided by 7.

First, substitute \( n = 2 \) into the expression \( (n + 2)(n + 4)(n + 6) \):

\[
(n + 2) \equiv (2 + 2) \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
\]
\[
(n + 4) \equiv (2 + 4) \equiv 6 \pmod{7}

\[
(n + 6) \equiv (2 + 6) \equiv 8 \equiv 1 \pmod{7}

Now, substitute these congruences back into the product:

\[

Next, calculate the product \( 4 \cdot 6 \cdot 1 \):

\[
4 \cdot 6 = 24

\[
24 \cdot 1 = 24

Finally, find the remainder when 24 is divided by 7:

"To determine the smallest angle by which a regular pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position, we need to consider the symmetry of the pentagon. A regular pentagon has rotational symmetry, meaning it looks the same after being rotated by certain angles around its center.

The order of rotational symmetry for a regular pentagon is 5. This means that there are 5 different positions in which the pentagon looks exactly the same when rotated around its center. The angle of rotation for each symmetry position is given by dividing the full circle (360 degrees) by the order of symmetry.

So, we calculate the angle of rotation as follows:
\[
\frac{360^\circ}{5} = 72^\circ

Therefore, the smallest angle by which the pentagon must be rotated to return to its original position is \(\boxed{72}\) degrees.","[72, '72']",72,"[72, '72']",True
"To determine the coordinates of the fourth vertex of the parallelogram, we can use the property that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other. This means that the midpoint of one diagonal is the same as the midpoint of the other diagonal.

Let's denote the vertices of the parallelogram as \( A(5, 3) \), \( B(6, 8) \), \( C(7, 4) \), and \( D(x, y) \). We need to find the coordinates of \( D \).

First, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( AC \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AC = \left( \frac{5+7}{2}, \frac{3+4}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{12}{2}, \frac{7}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

Next, we calculate the midpoint of the diagonal \( BD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } BD = \left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right)
\]

Since the diagonals bisect each other, the midpoints must be equal:
\[
\left( \frac{6+x}{2}, \frac{8+y}{2} \right) = (6, 3.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{6+x}{2} = 6 \implies 6+x = 12 \implies x = 6
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{8+y}{2} = 3.5 \implies 8+y = 7 \implies y = -1
\]

However, we are given that \( x > 7 \). Therefore, \( x = 6 \) is not a valid solution. Let's re-evaluate the problem by considering another pair of diagonals.

Let's consider the diagonals \( AB \) and \( CD \):
\[
\text{Midpoint of } AB = \left( \frac{5+6}{2}, \frac{3+8}{2} \right) = \left( \frac{11}{2}, \frac{11}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

\[
\text{Midpoint of } CD = \left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right)
\]

Setting the midpoints equal:
\[
\left( \frac{7+x}{2}, \frac{4+y}{2} \right) = (5.5, 5.5)
\]

This gives us two equations:
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \quad \text{and} \quad \frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5
\]

Solving the first equation for \( x \):
\[
\frac{7+x}{2} = 5.5 \implies 7+x = 11 \implies x = 4
\]

Solving the second equation for \( y \):
\[
\frac{4+y}{2} = 5.5 \implies 4+y = 11 \implies y = 7
\]

"To find the vertical asymptotes of the function \( f(x) = \frac{2x}{x^2-5x-14} \), we need to determine where the denominator is zero, since the function is undefined at these points. The denominator is a quadratic expression, which we can factor as follows:

\[ x^2 - 5x - 14 = (x-7)(x+2). \]

Setting the denominator equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[ (x-7)(x+2) = 0. \]

So, the vertical asymptotes occur at \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -2 \). Therefore, \( a = 7 \) and \( b = -2 \).

Next, we need to find the horizontal asymptote. The horizontal asymptote of a rational function is determined by the degrees of the numerator and the denominator. The numerator is a linear polynomial (degree 1) and the denominator is a quadratic polynomial (degree 2). Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is \( y = 0 \). Therefore, \( c = 0 \).

Now, we can find the sum \( a + b + c \):

"To find the smallest positive real number \( C \) such that the inequality

\[
\left\| \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \bold{v} \right\| \le C \|\bold{v}\|
\]

holds for all two-dimensional vectors \(\bold{v}\), we need to determine the operator norm of the matrix \( A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \). The operator norm of a matrix \( A \) is given by

\[
\|A\| = \max_{\|\bold{v}\| = 1} \left\| A \bold{v} \right\|.
\]

Let \(\bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix}\). Then,

\[
A \bold{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} x \\ y \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 2x + 3y \\ -2y \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The norm of \( A \bold{v} \) is

\[
\left\| A \bold{v} \right\| = \sqrt{(2x + 3y)^2 + (-2y)^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 9y^2 + 4y^2} = \sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}.
\]

We need to maximize this expression subject to the constraint \(\|\bold{v}\| = 1\), which means \( x^2 + y^2 = 1 \). To find the maximum value, we can use the method of Lagrange multipliers or analyze the expression directly. Here, we will use the method of eigenvalues.

The matrix \( A^T A \) is

\[
A^T A = \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 0 \\ 3 & -2 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 2 & 3 \\ 0 & -2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 & 6 \\ 6 & 13 \end{pmatrix}.
\]

The eigenvalues of \( A^T A \) are the roots of the characteristic polynomial

\[
\det(A^T A - \lambda I) = \det \begin{pmatrix} 4 - \lambda & 6 \\ 6 & 13 - \lambda \end{pmatrix} = (4 - \lambda)(13 - \lambda) - 36 = \lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28.
\]

Solving the quadratic equation \(\lambda^2 - 17\lambda + 28 = 0\), we get

\[
\lambda = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{289 - 112}}{2} = \frac{17 \pm \sqrt{177}}{2}.
\]

The eigenvalues are \(\lambda_1 = \frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}\) and \(\lambda_2 = \frac{17 - \sqrt{177}}{2}\). The operator norm of \( A \) is the square root of the maximum eigenvalue of \( A^T A \), which is

\[
\|A\| = \sqrt{\frac{17 + \sqrt{177}}{2}}.
\]

However, we can also find the operator norm by considering the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) on the unit circle. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have

\[
(4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2) = (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4x^2 + 9y^2 + 4y^2 + 12xy) \le (4 + 13)(x^2 + y^2) = 17.
\]

Thus, the maximum value of \(\sqrt{4x^2 + 12xy + 13y^2}\) is \(\sqrt{17}\). Therefore, the smallest positive real number \( C \) is

"To determine the value of \(1^{(2^{235423523})}\), we start by examining the properties of exponents when the base is 1. Specifically, any number raised to any power is still 1 if the base is 1. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[1^n = 1 \text{ for any integer } n.\]

In this problem, the base is 1 and the exponent is \(2^{235423523}\). Since \(2^{235423523}\) is an integer, we can apply the property of exponents mentioned above:

\[1^{(2^{235423523})} = 1.\]

"Given that \( z \) is a complex number such that \( z^5 = 1 \) and \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) is a primitive 5th root of unity. The 5th roots of unity are the solutions to the equation \( z^5 - 1 = 0 \), which can be factored as \( (z-1)(z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1) = 0 \). Since \( z \neq 1 \), \( z \) satisfies the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \).

We need to find the value of \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \). First, note that since \( z^5 = 1 \), we have \( \frac{1}{z} = z^4 \) and \( \frac{1}{z^2} = z^3 \). Therefore, the expression \( z + \frac{1}{z} + z^2 + \frac{1}{z^2} \) can be rewritten as \( z + z^4 + z^2 + z^3 \).

From the equation \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z + 1 = 0 \), we can isolate \( z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z \) by subtracting 1 from both sides:
\[ z^4 + z^3 + z^2 + z = -1. \]

"To solve the problem \(58_9 - 18_9\) and express the answer in base 9, we can follow these steps:

1. **Convert the base 9 numbers to base 10:**
   - The base 9 number \(58_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
     \[
     58_9 = 5 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 5 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 45 + 8 = 53_{10}
     \]
   - The base 9 number \(18_9\) can be converted to base 10 as follows:
     \[
     18_9 = 1 \cdot 9^1 + 8 \cdot 9^0 = 1 \cdot 9 + 8 \cdot 1 = 9 + 8 = 17_{10}
     \]

2. **Perform the subtraction in base 10:**
   \[
   53_{10} - 17_{10} = 36_{10}
   \]

3. **Convert the result back to base 9:**
   - To convert \(36_{10}\) to base 9, we need to determine the coefficients of the powers of 9. We start by finding the largest power of 9 that is less than or equal to 36.
     - \(9^2 = 81\) (which is greater than 36, so we use \(9^1\) and \(9^0\))
     - \(9^1 = 9\)
     - \(9^0 = 1\)
   - We divide 36 by 9 to find the coefficient for \(9^1\):
     \[
     36 \div 9 = 4 \quad \text{(so the coefficient for } 9^1 \text{ is 4)}
     \]
   - We then subtract \(4 \cdot 9 = 36\) from 36 to find the coefficient for \(9^0\):
     \[
     36 - 36 = 0 \quad \text{(so the coefficient for } 9^0 \text{ is 0)}
     \]
   - Therefore, \(36_{10}\) in base 9 is \(40_9\).

4. **Verify the answer:**
   - We can verify the answer by converting \(40_9\) back to base 10:
     \[
     40_9 = 4 \cdot 9^1 + 0 \cdot 9^0 = 4 \cdot 9 + 0 \cdot 1 = 36 + 0 = 36_{10}

"To simplify the expression \(\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\), we start by expressing \(\sec x\) in terms of \(\cos x\). Recall that \(\sec x = \frac{1}{\cos x}\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\sec x}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

Next, we simplify \(\frac{\frac{1}{\cos x}}{\sin x}\). This is equivalent to \(\frac{1}{\cos x} \cdot \frac{1}{\sin x} = \frac{1}{\cos x \sin x}\). So the expression becomes:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin x}{\cos x}
\]

To combine these two fractions, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for \(\cos x \sin x\) and \(\cos x\) is \(\cos x \sin x\). We rewrite \(\frac{\sin x}{\cos x}\) with the common denominator:

\[
\frac{\sin x}{\cos x} = \frac{\sin x \cdot \sin x}{\cos x \cdot \sin x} = \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

Now we can combine the fractions:

\[
\frac{1}{\cos x \sin x} - \frac{\sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{1 - \sin^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We know from the Pythagorean identity that \(1 - \sin^2 x = \cos^2 x\). Substituting this into the expression, we get:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x}
\]

We can simplify this fraction by canceling out one \(\cos x\) in the numerator and the denominator:

\[
\frac{\cos^2 x}{\cos x \sin x} = \frac{\cos x}{\sin x}
\]

We recognize that \(\frac{\cos x}{\sin x}\) is the cotangent of \(x\), denoted as \(\cot x\). Therefore, the simplified form of the expression is:

"Let's define the weight of a treeki as \( T \), the weight of a squig as \( S \), and the weight of a goole as \( G \).

From the problem, we have the following two equations:
1. The weight of one treeki is equal to the weight of three squigs plus the weight of one goole:
   \[
   T = 3S + G
   \]
2. The weight of two treeki and one goole is equal to the weight of one squig:
   \[
   2T + G = S
   \]

We need to find the weight of one treeki in terms of the weight of one squig, i.e., we need to express \( T \) in terms of \( S \).

First, let's solve the second equation for \( G \):
\[
G = S - 2T
\]

Next, substitute this expression for \( G \) into the first equation:
\[
T = 3S + (S - 2T)
\]
Simplify the right side of the equation:
\[
T = 3S + S - 2T
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
T = 4S - 2T
\]
Add \( 2T \) to both sides of the equation:
\[
3T = 4S

Divide both sides by 3:
\[

"To find the values of \(a\) and \(b\) such that the product of the polynomials \(3t^2 + 5t + a\) and \(4t^2 + bt - 2\) equals \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\), we start by expanding the product of the two polynomials.

\[
(3t^2 + 5t + a)(4t^2 + bt - 2)
\]

We use the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials, but extended to trinomials) to expand this product:

\[
= 3t^2 \cdot 4t^2 + 3t^2 \cdot bt + 3t^2 \cdot (-2) + 5t \cdot 4t^2 + 5t \cdot bt + 5t \cdot (-2) + a \cdot 4t^2 + a \cdot bt + a \cdot (-2)
\]

Now, we perform each multiplication:

\[
= 12t^4 + 3bt^3 - 6t^2 + 20t^3 + 5bt^2 - 10t + 4at^2 + abt - 2a
\]

Next, we combine like terms:

\[
= 12t^4 + (3b + 20)t^3 + (-6 + 5b + 4a)t^2 + (-10 + ab)t - 2a
\]

We know this expanded form must equal the given polynomial \(12t^4 + 26t^3 - 8t^2 - 16t + 6\). Therefore, we equate the coefficients of corresponding powers of \(t\) from both polynomials:

1. Coefficient of \(t^4\):
\[
12 = 12
\]

2. Coefficient of \(t^3\):
\[
3b + 20 = 26
\]

3. Coefficient of \(t^2\):
\[
-6 + 5b + 4a = -8
\]

4. Coefficient of \(t\):
\[
-10 + ab = -16
\]

5. Constant term:
\[
-2a = 6
\]

We solve these equations step by step.

First, solve for \(a\) from the constant term equation:
\[
-2a = 6 \implies a = -3
\]

Next, substitute \(a = -3\) into the coefficient of \(t^3\) equation:
\[
3b + 20 = 26 \implies 3b = 6 \implies b = 2
\]

Now, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the coefficient of \(t^2\) equation to verify:
\[
-6 + 5(2) + 4(-3) = -6 + 10 - 12 = -8
\]
This is correct.

Finally, substitute \(a = -3\) and \(b = 2\) into the coefficient of \(t\) equation to verify:
\[
-10 + (-3)(2) = -10 - 6 = -16
\]
This is correct.

Since all the coefficients match, our values for \(a\) and \(b\) are correct. Therefore, we find \(a + b\):

\[
a + b = -3 + 2 = -1

Thus, the value of \(a + b\) is \(\boxed{-1}\).","[-1, '-1']",-1,"[-1, '-1']",True
"To determine the radius of the cylindrical tank, we need to analyze the relationship between the volume of water added to the tank and the increase in the water level. Let's denote the radius of the cylindrical tank by \( r \) meters and the height of the tank by \( h \) meters.

The volume \( V \) of a cylinder is given by the formula:
\[ V = \pi r^2 h \]

We know that the water is being added to the tank at a rate of \( 20\pi \) cubic meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the volume \( V \) with respect to time \( t \) is:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = 20\pi \]

The water level is rising at a rate of 4 meters per hour. This means that the rate of change of the height \( h \) with respect to time \( t \) is:
\[ \frac{dh}{dt} = 4 \]

Using the chain rule, we can relate the rate of change of the volume to the rate of change of the height:
\[ \frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r^2 \frac{dh}{dt} \]

Substituting the known values into this equation, we get:
\[ 20\pi = \pi r^2 \cdot 4 \]

We can simplify this equation by dividing both sides by \( \pi \):
\[ 20 = 4r^2 \]

Next, we solve for \( r^2 \) by dividing both sides by 4:
\[ r^2 = 5 \]

Finally, we solve for \( r \) by taking the square root of both sides:
\[ r = \sqrt{5} \]

Therefore, the radius of the cylindrical tank is:

"To determine the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once, we need to analyze the behavior of the function \(f(x)\) in both regions defined by the piecewise function.

The function \(f(x)\) is given by:
\[ f(x) =
\begin{cases}
ax^2 & \text{jos } x \geq a,\\
ax + 2a & \text{jos } x < a.
\end{cases}
\]

### Step 1: Analyze the quadratic part \(f(x) = ax^2\) for \(x \geq a\)
The quadratic function \(ax^2\) is a parabola opening upwards if \(a > 0\) and downwards if \(a < 0\). For \(x \geq a\), the minimum value of \(ax^2\) occurs at \(x = a\), and it is:
\[ f(a) = a \cdot a^2 = a^3. \]
If \(a > 0\), the function \(ax^2\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(ax^2\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 2: Analyze the linear part \(f(x) = ax + 2a\) for \(x < a\)
The linear function \(ax + 2a\) is a straight line with slope \(a\). For \(x < a\), the value of \(f(x)\) approaches \(a^2 + 2a\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) from the left. If \(a > 0\), the function \(ax + 2a\) increases without bound as \(x\) increases. If \(a < 0\), the function \(ax + 2a\) decreases without bound as \(x\) increases.

### Step 3: Determine the condition for the function to intersect every horizontal line
For the function \(f(x)\) to intersect every horizontal line at least once, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) must be less than or equal to the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\). This ensures that there is no gap between the values of the function in the two regions.

From the analysis above, the minimum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x \geq a\) is \(a^3\), and the maximum value of \(f(x)\) for \(x < a\) is \(a^2 + 2a\). Therefore, we need:
\[ a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a. \]

### Step 4: Solve the inequality \(a^3 \leq a^2 + 2a\)
Rearrange the inequality to form a polynomial inequality:
\[ a^3 - a^2 - 2a \leq 0. \]
Factor out the common term \(a\):
\[ a(a^2 - a - 2) \leq 0. \]
Factor the quadratic expression:
\[ a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0. \]
The roots of the polynomial are \(a = 0\), \(a = 2\), and \(a = -1\). We need to determine the intervals where the product \(a(a - 2)(a + 1)\) is less than or equal to zero. We test the sign of the product in the intervals determined by the roots: \((-\infty, -1)\), \((-1, 0)\), \((0, 2)\), and \((2, \infty)\).

- For \(a \in (-\infty, -1)\), choose \(a = -2\): \((-2)(-2 - 2)(-2 + 1) = (-2)(-4)(-1) = -8\), which is less than 0.
- For \(a \in (-1, 0)\), choose \(a = -0.5\): \((-0.5)(-0.5 - 2)(-0.5 + 1) = (-0.5)(-2.5)(0.5) = 0.625\), which is greater than 0.
- For \(a \in (0, 2)\), choose \(a = 1\): \((1)(1 - 2)(1 + 1) = (1)(-1)(2) = -2\), which is less than 0.
- For \(a \in (2, \infty)\), choose \(a = 3\): \((3)(3 - 2)(3 + 1) = (3)(1)(4) = 12\), which is greater than 0.

The inequality \(a(a - 2)(a + 1) \leq 0\) is satisfied in the intervals \((-\infty, -1]\) and \([0, 2]\). Since we are looking for the largest value of \(a\), we take the maximum value in the interval \([0, 2]\), which is \(a = 2\).

Therefore, the largest value of \(a\) such that the graph of \(y = f(x)\) intersects every horizontal line at least once is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",2,"[2, '2']",True
"To determine the value of \( c \) for which the radius of the circle given by the equation \( x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = 0 \) is 1, we need to rewrite the equation in the standard form of a circle's equation, which is \( (x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2 \). Here, \((h, k)\) is the center of the circle and \( r \) is the radius.

First, we complete the square for the \( x \) and \( y \) terms in the given equation.

Starting with the \( x \)-terms:
\[ x^2 - 10x \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \(-10\), divide it by 2 to get \(-5\), and then square it to get \( 25 \). So, we add and subtract 25:
\[ x^2 - 10x + 25 - 25 = (x-5)^2 - 25 \]

Next, we complete the square for the \( y \)-terms:
\[ y^2 + 6y \]
To complete the square, we take half of the coefficient of \( y \), which is \(6\), divide it by 2 to get \(3\), and then square it to get \( 9 \). So, we add and subtract 9:
\[ y^2 + 6y + 9 - 9 = (y+3)^2 - 9 \]

Now, substitute these completed squares back into the original equation:
\[ x^2 - 10x + y^2 + 6y + c = (x-5)^2 - 25 + (y+3)^2 - 9 + c = 0 \]
Combine the constant terms:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 - 34 + c = 0 \]
Rearrange the equation to isolate the completed squares on one side:
\[ (x-5)^2 + (y+3)^2 = 34 - c \]

For the equation to represent a circle with radius 1, the right-hand side must be equal to \( 1^2 = 1 \). Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[ 34 - c = 1 \]
Solve for \( c \):
\[ c = 34 - 1 \]
\[ c = 33 \]

Thus, the value of \( c \) is \(\boxed{33}\).","[33, '33']",33,"[33, '33']",True
"To find the values of \(\lambda\) for which there exists \(x \in [0,1]\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\) but \(f(f(x)) = x\), we start by analyzing the function \(f(x) = \lambda x(1 - x)\).

First, we need to find the fixed points of \(f(x)\), i.e., the solutions to the equation \(f(x) = x\):
\[
\lambda x(1 - x) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda x - \lambda x^2 = x \implies \lambda x^2 - (\lambda - 1)x = 0 \implies x(\lambda x - (\lambda - 1)) = 0.
\]
This gives us two solutions:
\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}.
\]
For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to hold, \(x\) must be a periodic point of period 2. This means that \(f(f(x)) = x\) but \(f(x) \neq x\). Let's compute \(f(f(x))\):
\[
f(f(x)) = f(\lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda (\lambda x(1 - x))(1 - \lambda x(1 - x)) = \lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2).
\]
We need to solve the equation \(f(f(x)) = x\):
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) = x.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 x(1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - x = 0 \implies x(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1) = 0.
\]
This gives us two cases to consider:
1. \(x = 0\),
2. \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\).

Since we are looking for \(x\) such that \(f(x) \neq x\), we discard \(x = 0\) and focus on the second case:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0.
\]
Expanding the left-hand side, we get:
\[
\lambda^2 (1 - x - \lambda x + \lambda x^2 + \lambda x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 (1 - (1 + \lambda)x + (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 x^3) - 1 = \lambda^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^4 x^3 - 1.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1 = 0.
\]
We know that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is a solution to \(f(x) = x\), so it must not be a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). Substituting \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) into the equation \(\lambda^2 (1 - x)(1 - \lambda x + \lambda x^2) - 1 = 0\), we get:
\[
\lambda^2 \left(1 - \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - \lambda \cdot \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda} + \lambda \left(\frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\right)^2\right) - 1 = \lambda^2 \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right)\left(1 - (\lambda - 1) + \frac{(\lambda - 1)^2}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = \lambda \left(1 - \lambda + 1 + \frac{\lambda^2 - 2\lambda + 1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = \lambda \left(2 - \lambda + \lambda - 2 + \frac{1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = \lambda \left(\frac{1}{\lambda}\right) - 1 = 1 - 1 = 0.
\]
This confirms that \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\) is indeed a solution to \(f(f(x)) = x\). For \(f(f(x)) = x\) to have a solution \(x \neq 0\) and \(x \neq \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\), the cubic polynomial \(-\lambda^4 x^3 + \lambda^2 (2\lambda + \lambda^2)x^2 - \lambda^2 (1 + \lambda)x + \lambda^2 - 1\) must have a root in the interval \([0,1]\) other than \(x = 0\) and \(x = \frac{\lambda - 1}{\lambda}\). This occurs when the discriminant of the cubic polynomial is non-negative and the polynomial has a real root in the interval \([0,1]\).

By analyzing the behavior of the function and the polynomial, we find that the values of \(\lambda\) that satisfy this condition are \(2 < \lambda \le 4\). Therefore, the answer is:

"To solve for the angle \(\theta\) in the given equation, we start by simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately. The given expression is:

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}{\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ}.
\]

First, we use the angle addition and subtraction formulas for cosine and sine. Recall that:

\[
\cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B,
\]
\[
\sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B.
\]

We can rewrite the numerator as:

\[
\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = (\cos 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) + (\cos 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the cosine addition formula, this becomes:

\[
\cos(5^\circ + 20^\circ) + \cos(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\cos 85^\circ = \sin 5^\circ\), so the numerator simplifies to:

\[
\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ.
\]

Next, we simplify the denominator:

\[
\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ - \sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ - \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ = (\sin 5^\circ \cos 20^\circ + \cos 5^\circ \sin 20^\circ) - (\sin 35^\circ \cos 50^\circ + \cos 35^\circ \sin 50^\circ).
\]

Using the sine addition formula, this becomes:

\[
\sin(5^\circ + 20^\circ) - \sin(35^\circ + 50^\circ) = \sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ.
\]

We know that \(\sin 85^\circ = \cos 5^\circ\), so the denominator simplifies to:

\[
\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ.
\]

Now, we substitute these simplified forms back into the original expression for \(\tan \theta\):

\[
\tan \theta = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

To simplify this further, we use the identity \(\sin 25^\circ = \cos 65^\circ\) and \(\cos 25^\circ = \sin 65^\circ\). However, a more straightforward approach is to recognize that the expression can be rewritten using the tangent of a sum formula. Notice that:

\[
\frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos 85^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin 85^\circ} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \cos(90^\circ - 5^\circ)}{\sin 25^\circ - \sin(90^\circ - 5^\circ)} = \frac{\cos 25^\circ + \sin 5^\circ}{\sin 25^\circ - \cos 5^\circ}.
\]

This is the same as:

\[
\tan \theta = \tan(40^\circ).

The formula for the number of distinct permutations of a word with repeated letters is given by:

\[
\frac{n!}{n_1! \cdot n_2! \cdot \ldots \cdot n_k!}
\]

where \( n \) is the total number of letters, and \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the frequencies of the distinct letters.

For the word ""LLIPSE"":
- The total number of letters \( n \) is 7.
- The frequency of ""L"" (\( n_1 \)) is 3.
- The frequency of ""I"" (\( n_2 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""P"" (\( n_3 \)) is 1.
- The frequency of ""S"" (\( n_4 \)) is 1.

- \( 3! = 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6 \)

Now, we divide \( 5040 \) by \( 6 \):

First, let's check the value of \( f(x, y) \) at the corners of the domain, i.e., at the points \((1,0)\), \((0,1)\), \((-1,0)\), and \((0,-1)\):
- At \((1,0)\), \( f(1,0) = 1 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 0^2} + 0 \cdot \sqrt{1 - 1^2} = 1 \cdot 1 + 0 \cdot 0 = 1 \).

Next, we consider the function along the line \( x = y \). Substituting \( y = x \) into the function, we get:

Setting the derivative equal to zero, we get:
\[ 2 \cdot \frac{1 - 2x^2}{\sqrt{1 - x^2}} = 0 \implies 1 - 2x^2 = 0 \implies x^2 = \frac{1}{2} \implies x = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}. \]
Substituting \( x = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \) into \( f(x, x) \), we get:

Next, we compute the cross product \(\overrightarrow{OA} \times \overrightarrow{OB}\). The cross product of two vectors \(\begin{pmatrix} a_1 \\ a_2 \\ a_3 \end{pmatrix}\) and \(\begin{pmatrix} b_1 \\ b_2 \\ b_3 \end{pmatrix}\) is given by:

"To solve for the area of triangle \( ENG \), we start by noting that \( G \) is the centroid of triangle \( ABC \). The centroid divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the longer segment being closer to the vertex.

Given that the line through \( G \) is parallel to \( BC \), it will intersect \( AB \) at \( M \) and \( AC \) at \( N \). Since \( MN \parallel BC \), triangles \( AMN \) and \( ABC \) are similar by the AA (Angle-Angle) similarity criterion.

The ratio of the sides of similar triangles is equal to the ratio of the distances from the corresponding vertices to the line parallel to the base. Since \( G \) divides each median in a 2:1 ratio, the distance from \( A \) to \( MN \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the distance from \( A \) to \( BC \).

Therefore, the ratio of the sides of triangle \( AMN \) to triangle \( ABC \) is \( \frac{2}{3} \).

"To find the volume of the cone, we use the formula given:

where \( B \) is the area of the base and \( h \) is the height of the cone. According to the problem, the area of the base \( B \) is 30 square units and the height \( h \) is 6.5 units. We substitute these values into the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 30 \times 6.5 \]

First, we multiply 30 by 6.5:

\[ 30 \times 6.5 = 195 \]

Next, we multiply this result by \(\frac{1}{3}\):

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \times 195 = 65 \]

"To find the sixth term of the arithmetic sequence, we start by recalling the general formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d\]

where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

We are given that the fourth term (\(a_4\)) is 200 and the eighth term (\(a_8\)) is 500. Using the general formula, we can write:

\[a_4 = a_1 + 3d = 200\]
\[a_8 = a_1 + 7d = 500\]

We now have a system of linear equations:

1. \(a_1 + 3d = 200\)
2. \(a_1 + 7d = 500\)

To eliminate \(a_1\), we subtract the first equation from the second:

\[(a_1 + 7d) - (a_1 + 3d) = 500 - 200\]
\[4d = 300\]
\[d = 75\]

Now that we have the common difference \(d\), we can substitute it back into the first equation to find \(a_1\):

\[a_1 + 3(75) = 200\]
\[a_1 + 225 = 200\]
\[a_1 = 200 - 225\]
\[a_1 = -25\]

Now that we have \(a_1 = -25\) and \(d = 75\), we can find the sixth term (\(a_6\)) using the general formula:

\[a_6 = a_1 + 5d\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 5(75)\]
\[a_6 = -25 + 375\]
\[a_6 = 350\]

"To convert the fraction \(\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7}\) into a decimal, we start by simplifying the denominator. The denominator is \(2^2 \cdot 5^7\), which can be rewritten as \(4 \cdot 78125\). However, it is more useful to keep it in its prime factorized form for now.

The fraction is \(\frac{21}{4 \cdot 78125}\). To convert this fraction into a decimal, we need to express it with a power of 10 in the denominator. We can do this by multiplying both the numerator and the denominator by \(2^5\) to make the denominator \(2^7 \cdot 5^7 = 10^7\).

So, we have:
\[
\frac{21}{2^2 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 2^5}{2^7 \cdot 5^7} = \frac{21 \cdot 32}{10^7} = \frac{672}{10000000}
\]

Now, we can write \(\frac{672}{10000000}\) as a decimal by placing the numerator 672 in a decimal with 7 digits after the decimal point:
\[
\frac{672}{10000000} = 0.0000672

"To determine how many positive integers between 100 and 150 have both 100 and 150 as factors, we need to find the least common multiple (LCM) of these two numbers. The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both.

First, we find the prime factorizations of 100 and 150:
\[
100 = 2^2 \times 5^2
\]
\[
150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2

The LCM is found by taking the highest power of each prime that appears in the factorizations:
\[

The LCM of 100 and 150 is 300. Since 300 is greater than 150, there are no positive integers between 100 and 150 that are multiples of both 100 and 150.

"To determine the smallest positive integer \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power, we need to find \( n \) such that \( 2^{24} \) can be expressed as \( (2^k)^n \) for some integer \( k \). This means that \( 2^{24} = 2^{kn} \), which implies that \( kn = 24 \). Therefore, \( n \) must be a divisor of 24.

The divisors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24. Since we are looking for the smallest \( n > 1 \), we start with the smallest divisor greater than 1, which is 2.

If \( n = 2 \), then \( k = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \), and \( 2^{24} = (2^{12})^2 \), which is true. Therefore, \( n = 2 \) is a solution.

To confirm that this is the smallest possible \( n \), we check the next smallest divisor, which is 3. If \( n = 3 \), then \( k = \frac{24}{3} = 8 \), and \( 2^{24} = (2^8)^3 \), which is also true. However, since we are looking for the smallest \( n \), we do not need to check further.

Thus, the smallest positive integer \( n > 1 \) such that \( 2^{24} \) is a perfect \( n \)-th power is \(\boxed{2}\).","[2, '2']",7,"[7, '7']",False

Let \( x \) be the number of five-sentimeter coins.
Let \( y \) be the number of ten-sentimeter coins.

We know two things:
1. The total number of coins is 15.
2. The total value of the coins is 75 sentimeters.

We can express these two pieces of information as the following system of equations:
\[ x + y = 15 \]
\[ 5x + 10y = 75 \]

First, we simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 5:
\[ x + 2y = 15 \]

Now we have the simplified system:
\[ x + y = 15 \]
\[ x + 2y = 15 \]

Next, we subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( x \):
\[ (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 15 - 15 \]
\[ x + 2y - x - y = 0 \]
\[ y = 0 \]

This result indicates that there are no ten-sentimeter coins. Therefore, all 15 coins must be five-sentimeter coins.

Thus, the number of five-sentimeter coins Hillaryll has is:

Next, we note that a sum of two numbers is even if both numbers are either even or both are odd. In the set of the first six prime numbers, there is only one even number, which is \(2\), and five odd numbers, which are \(3, 5, 7, 11, 13\).

"To determine the area of the shaded region in the given diagram, we need to analyze the structure of the grid and the diagonals drawn.

1. **Identify the grid and the diagonals:**
   - The grid is a 4x3 grid of 1x1 squares.
   - There are two diagonals: one from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner, and another from the top-left corner to the bottom-left corner of the top row.

2. **Calculate the area of the entire grid:**
   - The grid is 4 units wide and 3 units tall.
   - Therefore, the total area of the grid is:

"To find the smallest positive 450's multiple where all the digits are either 0 or 1, we need to consider the properties of such numbers. Let's denote this number as \( N \). Since \( N \) is a multiple of 450, it must be divisible by both 2 and 225 (because \( 450 = 2 \times 225 \)).

First, let's consider the divisibility by 2. A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0 or 2. Since the digits of \( N \) can only be 0 or 1, the last digit must be 0.

Next, let's consider the divisibility by 225. A number is divisible by 225 if it is divisible by both 9 and 25. 

1. **Divisibility by 25**: A number is divisible by 25 if its last two digits are 00, 25, 50, or 75. Since the digits of \( N \) can only be 0 or 1, the last two digits must be 00.

2. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Since the digits of \( N \) are either 0 or 1, the sum of the digits is simply the number of 1's in \( N \). Therefore, \( N \) must have a number of 1's that is divisible by 9.

Given that \( N \) has its last two digits as 00, we need to find the smallest number of 1's that is divisible by 9 and results in a 450's multiple. The smallest such number is 9, because \( 9 \times 50 = 450 \), and the number 11111111100 has 9 ones and ends in 00.

2. **Determine the number of favorable outcomes:**
   - The pelinappula is set on the square where the column number (from the first pyörä) and the row number (from the second pyörä) meet.
   - For the pelinappula to be set on a square that has beenvarjostet, both the column number and the row number must be between 1 and 4 (inclusive). This is because thevarjostet squares are the top-left 4x4 grid of the chessboard.

\[
\sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin 100^\circ \sin 120^\circ \sin 140^\circ \sin 160^\circ = \sin 20^\circ \sin 40^\circ \sin 60^\circ \sin 80^\circ \sin (180^\circ - 80^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 60^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 40^\circ) \sin (180^\circ - 20^\circ)

Setting \(x = 20^\circ\), we get:

Substituting this back into our expression, we have:

- \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate in the \( xy \)-plane,
- \( z \) is the height above the \( xy \)-plane.

The equation \( z = c \) means that the height \( z \) is a constant value \( c \). This implies that for any point on the surface, the \( z \)-coordinate is always \( c \), regardless of the values of \( r \) and \( \theta \).

In other words, the surface \( z = c \) is a plane that is parallel to the \( xy \)-plane and intersects the \( z \)-axis at \( z = c \).

We are given that \(\|\mathbf{a}\| = 2\), \(\|\mathbf{b}\| = 7\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b} = \begin{pmatrix} 3 \\ 2 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}\). First, we calculate the magnitude of \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}\):

The sum of the roots of a cubic polynomial \( ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d \) is given by the formula \( -\frac{b}{a} \). For the polynomial \( g(x) = x^3 - 34x^2 + 208x \), the coefficients are \( a = 1 \), \( b = -34 \), \( c = 208 \), and \( d = 0 \). Therefore, the sum of the roots is:

"To solve the expression \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}\), we start by using the identity \(\frac{1}{\cos^2 x} = 1 + \tan^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\sin^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\sin^2 40^\circ}.
\]

Next, we use the identity \(\frac{1}{\sin^2 x} = 1 + \cot^2 x\). This transforms the expression into:

\[
1 + \tan^2 10^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 20^\circ + 1 + \cot^2 40^\circ = 3 + \tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ.
\]

Now, we need to simplify \(\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ\). We use the identity \(\cot x = \frac{1}{\tan x}\), so \(\cot^2 x = \frac{1}{\tan^2 x}\). This gives us:

\[
\tan^2 10^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = \tan^2 10^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}.
\]

We use the identity \(\tan 3x = \frac{3\tan x - \tan^3 x}{1 - 3\tan^2 x}\). For \(x = 20^\circ\), we have \(\tan 60^\circ = \sqrt{3}\), so:

\[
\sqrt{3} = \frac{3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ}{1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ}.
\]

Rearranging this equation, we get:

\[
\sqrt{3}(1 - 3\tan^2 20^\circ) = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\sqrt{3} - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ = 3\tan 20^\circ - \tan^3 20^\circ,
\]
\[
\tan^3 20^\circ - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 20^\circ - 3\tan 20^\circ + \sqrt{3} = 0.
\]

This is a cubic equation in \(\tan 20^\circ\). We can use the fact that \(\tan 20^\circ\), \(\tan 40^\circ\), and \(\tan 80^\circ\) are the roots of the equation \(\tan^3 x - 3\sqrt{3}\tan^2 x - 3\tan x + \sqrt{3} = 0\) when \(x = 20^\circ, 40^\circ, 80^\circ\). By Vieta's formulas, we know that:

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ = -3,
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ = -\sqrt{3}.
\]

Since \(\tan 80^\circ = \cot 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = -\sqrt{3},
\]
\[
\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.
\]

We substitute \(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ = -\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ\) into the identity \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \tan 80^\circ = 3\sqrt{3}\):

\[
\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ} = 3\sqrt{3}.
\]

We also know that \(\tan 20^\circ + \tan 40^\circ = 3\sqrt{3} - \frac{1}{\tan 10^\circ}\). Squaring both sides of the equation \(\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(\tan 20^\circ \tan 40^\circ + \tan 40^\circ \tan 80^\circ + \tan 80^\circ \tan 20^\circ) = (3\sqrt{3})^2\), we get:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \tan^2 80^\circ + 2(-\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ - 3 + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}) = 27,

\]

Since \(\tan^2 80^\circ = \cot^2 10^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} + \frac{1}{\tan^2 10^\circ} - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33,
\]
\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ - 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ = 33.
\]

Since \(\cot^2 20^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 20^\circ}\) and \(\cot^2 40^\circ = \frac{1}{\tan^2 40^\circ}\), we have:

\[
\tan^2 20^\circ + \cot^2 20^\circ + \tan^2 40^\circ + \cot^2 40^\circ = 33 + 2\sqrt{3} \tan 10^\circ.

"To determine the number of sides of a polygon given that the sum of all its interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\), we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the formula for the sum of interior angles of a polygon:**
   The sum of the interior angles of a polygon with \(n\) sides is given by:
   \[
   S = (n-2) \times 180^\circ
   \]

2. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \(S\) be the total sum of the interior angles of the polygon. According to the problem, the sum of all interior angles except one is \(1070^\circ\). Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   S - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

3. **Express the total sum \(S\) in terms of \(n\):**
   Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we substitute \(S\) with \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\):
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ - \text{one angle} = 1070^\circ
   \]

4. **Determine the range of possible values for the missing angle:**
   Since the interior angle of a polygon must be between \(0^\circ\) and \(180^\circ\), we can set up the inequality:
   \[
   0^\circ < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ
   \]

5. **Solve for \(n\):**
   First, isolate \((n-2) \times 180^\circ\) by adding the missing angle to both sides of the equation:
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180^\circ = 1070^\circ + \text{one angle}
   \]
   Since \(0^\circ < \text{one angle} < 180^\circ\), we can write:
   \[
   1070^\circ < (n-2) \times 180^\circ < 1250^\circ
   \]

6. **Divide the inequality by 180^\circ:**
   \[
   \frac{1070^\circ}{180^\circ} < n-2 < \frac{1250^\circ}{180^\circ}
   \]
   Simplify the fractions:
   \[
   5.9444 < n-2 < 6.9444
   \]

7. **Solve for \(n\):**
   Add 2 to all parts of the inequality:
   \[
   7.9444 < n < 8.9444
   \]

8. **Determine the integer value of \(n\):**
   Since \(n\) must be an integer, the only possible value is:
   \[
   n = 8

Therefore, the number of sides of the polygon is \(\boxed{8}\).","[8, '8']",8,"[8, '8']",True
"To solve for the odd integer \( t \) such that \( 0 < t < 23 \) and \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23, we start by using the definition of a modular inverse. The modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23 is a number \( x \) such that:

\[ t \cdot x \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

In this problem, we are given that \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \). Therefore, we can write:

\[ t \cdot (t+2) \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Expanding the left side of the congruence, we get:

\[ t^2 + 2t \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Rearranging the terms, we obtain a quadratic congruence:

\[ t^2 + 2t - 1 \equiv 0 \pmod{23} \]

To solve this quadratic congruence, we can use the quadratic formula \( t = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 2 \), and \( c = -1 \). Substituting these values into the quadratic formula, we get:

\[ t = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-1)}}{2 \cdot 1} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{4 + 4}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{8}}{2} = \frac{-2 \pm 2\sqrt{2}}{2} = -1 \pm \sqrt{2} \]

Next, we need to find the value of \( \sqrt{2} \) modulo 23. We need to find an integer \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

We can test values of \( x \) to find a solution. Let's test \( x = 5 \):

\[ 5^2 = 25 \equiv 2 \pmod{23} \]

So, \( \sqrt{2} \equiv 5 \pmod{23} \). Therefore, the solutions to the quadratic congruence are:

\[ t = -1 + 5 = 4 \]
\[ t = -1 - 5 = -6 \]

Since \( t \) must be a positive integer between 0 and 23, we discard \( t = -6 \) and keep \( t = 4 \).

To verify, we check if \( t+2 \) is the modular inverse of \( t \) modulo 23. For \( t = 4 \), we have \( t+2 = 6 \). We need to check if:

\[ 4 \cdot 6 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Calculating the left side, we get:

\[ 4 \cdot 6 = 24 \equiv 1 \pmod{23} \]

Since the congruence holds, \( t = 4 \) is indeed a solution. Therefore, the odd integer \( t \) is:

"To find the surface area of a cube given its volume, we start by recalling the formula for the volume of a cube. The volume \( V \) of a cube with side length \( s \) is given by:

This is a difference of squares, which can be simplified using the formula \((a + b)(a - b) = a^2 - b^2\). Here, \(a = 5\) and \(b = \sqrt{3}\). Applying the formula, we get:

\]

where \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) are points on the first and second lines, respectively, and \(\mathbf{b}\) is the direction vector of the lines.

First, we identify the points \(\mathbf{a}_1\) and \(\mathbf{a}_2\) and the direction vector \(\mathbf{b}\):

The rectangle is centered at the origin \((0,0)\) with a width of \(10\) units and a height of \(8\) units. Therefore, the \(x\)-coordinates of the points inside the rectangle must satisfy:

This means \(x\) can take any integer value from \(-4\) to \(4\), inclusive. The number of integer values in this range is:

"To find \((2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a})\), we can use the distributive property of the cross product. The distributive property states that for any vectors \(\mathbf{u}\), \(\mathbf{v}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\),

\[
(\mathbf{u} + \mathbf{v}) \times \mathbf{w} = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{w}
\]

and

\[
\mathbf{u} \times (\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{v} + \mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{w}.

Applying this property, we have:

We can further distribute each term:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = (2 \mathbf{b}) \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + (2 \mathbf{b}) \times \mathbf{a} = 2 (\mathbf{b} \times 3 \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}),

and

\[
\mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = \mathbf{a} \times (3 \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) + \mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a}.
\]

Since the cross product of any vector with itself is zero, \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{a} = \mathbf{0}\). Therefore, the expression simplifies to:

We can factor out the constants:

\[
(2 \mathbf{b} - \mathbf{a}) \times (3 \mathbf{c} + \mathbf{a}) = 2 \cdot 3 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}) = 6 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c}) + 2 (\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a}) - 3 (\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c}).
\]

We know from the problem statement that \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -7 \\ 18 \end{pmatrix}\), \(\mathbf{b} \times \mathbf{a} = -(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{b}) = -\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -7 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -6 \\ 7 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}\), and \(\mathbf{a} \times \mathbf{c} = \begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 7 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix}\).

We can now perform the scalar multiplications:

\[

\[

Adding these vectors together, we get:

\begin{pmatrix} 6 \\ -42 \\ 108 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ 14 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} -12 \\ -21 \\ -6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 6 - 12 - 12 \\ -42 + 14 - 21 \\ 108 - 6 - 6 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -18 \\ -49 \\ 96 \end{pmatrix}.

"To determine the average cost of Juan's 1970s postcards in senties, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of postcards from each country in the 1970s.
2. Determine the cost of each postcard from each country.
3. Calculate the total cost of all the postcards from the 1970s.
4. Divide the total cost by the total number of postcards from the 1970s to find the average cost.

From the table, we can see the following data for the 1970s:

- Brazil: 12 postcards at 6 senties each.
- France: 12 postcards at 4 senties each.
- Peru: 6 postcards at 5 senties each.
- Spain: 13 postcards at 9 senties each.

First, we calculate the total cost for each country:

- For Brazil: \(12 \text{ postcards} \times 6 \text{ senties/postcard} = 72 \text{ senties}\).
- For France: \(12 \text{ postcards} \times 4 \text{ senties/postcard} = 48 \text{ senties}\).
- For Peru: \(6 \text{ postcards} \times 5 \text{ senties/postcard} = 30 \text{ senties}\).
- For Spain: \(13 \text{ postcards} \times 9 \text{ senties/postcard} = 117 \text{ senties}\).

Next, we sum the total costs for all the postcards from the 1970s:

\[72 \text{ senties} + 48 \text{ senties} + 30 \text{ senties} + 117 \text{ senties} = 267 \text{ senties}\]

Then, we find the total number of postcards from the 1970s:

\[12 + 12 + 6 + 13 = 43 \text{ postcards}\]

Now, we calculate the average cost by dividing the total cost by the total number of postcards:

\[\frac{267 \text{ senties}}{43 \text{ postcards}} \approx 6.206976744 \text{ senties/postcard}\]

Rounding this to the nearest ten senties, we get:

\[6.206976744 \approx 6.2 \approx 6 \text{ senties}\]

Therefore, the average cost of Juan's 1970s postcards in senties is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",5.4 \text{ cents},"[5.40000000000000, '5.4']",False
"Given that \(ABCD\) is a trapezoid with \(AD \parallel BC\), \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), we need to find the area of \(\triangle ACD\) given that the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is 42.

First, let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides \(AD\) and \(BC\) as \(a\) and \(b\) respectively, and the height of the trapezoid (which is also the length of \(CD\)) as \(h\). Since \(\overline{AC} \perp \overline{CD}\), \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\).

The area of trapezoid \(ABCD\) is given by:
\[
[ABCD] = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
(a + b) \times h = 84
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) share the same height \(h\) and the base of \(\triangle ACD\) is \(a\). The area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

The area of \(\triangle ABC\) is:
\[
[\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

The sum of the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) is equal to the area of trapezoid \(ABCD\):
\[
[\triangle ACD] + [\triangle ABC] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h + \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h = \frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42
\]

Since \(\overline{AC}\) is the height of both triangles and it bisects \(\angle BAD\), the areas of \(\triangle ACD\) and \(\triangle ABC\) are in the ratio of their bases \(a\) and \(b\). Therefore, we can write:
\[
\frac{[\triangle ACD]}{[\triangle ABC]} = \frac{a}{b}
\]

Let \( [\triangle ACD] = x \). Then \( [\triangle ABC] = \frac{b}{a} x \). The sum of the areas is:
\[
x + \frac{b}{a} x = 42
\]
\[
x \left(1 + \frac{b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x \left(\frac{a + b}{a}\right) = 42
\]
\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{a + b}
\]

From the equation \((a + b) \times h = 84\), we can substitute \(a + b\) with \(\frac{84}{h}\):
\[
x = 42 \times \frac{a}{\frac{84}{h}} = 42 \times \frac{a \times h}{84} = \frac{42 \times a \times h}{84} = \frac{a \times h}{2}
\]

Thus, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{1}{2} \times a \times h
\]

Since we already know that \(\frac{1}{2} \times (a + b) \times h = 42\), and \(\overline{AC}\) bisects \(\angle BAD\), the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is half of the area of the trapezoid:
\[
[\triangle ACD] = \frac{42}{2} = 21
\]

Therefore, the area of \(\triangle ACD\) is:

"To solve the equation \(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}} = \frac{3}{2}\), we start by eliminating the square roots by squaring both sides of the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{\sqrt{2x}}{\sqrt{3x-1}}\right)^2 = \left(\frac{3}{2}\right)^2
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x}{3x-1} = \frac{9}{4}
\]

Next, we eliminate the fractions by cross-multiplying:

\[
4 \cdot 2x = 9 \cdot (3x - 1)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8x = 27x - 9
\]

To isolate \(x\), we subtract \(27x\) from both sides:

\[
8x - 27x = -9
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
-19x = -9
\]

We then divide both sides by \(-19\):

\[
x = \frac{9}{19}
\]

Finally, we need to check that this value of \(x\) satisfies the original equation. Substituting \(x = \frac{9}{19}\) into the original equation, we get:

"To determine the probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect when four points \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) are chosen randomly and independently from a circle, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the problem**: For two line segments to intersect, the points must be arranged such that one segment's endpoints are on opposite sides of the other segment. This means that if we consider the four points in a clockwise order, the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) will intersect if and only if the points are arranged as \(A, C, B, D\) or \(A, D, B, C\).

2. **Count the total number of arrangements**: There are \(4!\) (4 factorial) ways to arrange 4 points in a sequence. However, since the points are chosen randomly and independently from a circle, we need to consider the arrangements relative to each other, not the absolute positions. This means we need to count the distinct cyclic permutations of the points. There are \(4!\) ways to arrange 4 points in a line, but since we are dealing with a circle, we divide by 4 to account for the rotational symmetry. Therefore, the number of distinct cyclic permutations is:
   \[
   \frac{4!}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]
   These 6 distinct cyclic permutations are: \(A, B, C, D\), \(A, B, D, C\), \(A, C, B, D\), \(A, C, D, B\), \(A, D, B, C\), and \(A, D, C, B\).

3. **Count the number of favorable arrangements**: From the 6 distinct cyclic permutations, only 2 of them result in the segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersecting. These are \(A, C, B, D\) and \(A, D, B, C\).

4. **Calculate the probability**: The probability that the line segments \(AB\) and \(CD\) intersect is the number of favorable arrangements divided by the total number of distinct cyclic permutations:
   \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of favorable arrangements}}{\text{Total number of distinct cyclic permutations}} = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}

"To solve the problem, we need to find the angle \(\angle ADC\) such that the area of the region where the two circles overlap is \(\frac{5}{12}\) of the area of the larger circle. The radius of the larger circle is 2, so its area is:

\[
\pi \times 2^2 = 4\pi
\]

The area of the region where the circles overlap is given as \(\frac{5}{12} \times 4\pi = \frac{20\pi}{12} = \frac{5\pi}{3}\).

Let's denote the angle \(\angle ADC\) by \(\theta\). The area of the overlapping region can be calculated using the formula for the area of the intersection of two circles. The area of the intersection of two circles with radii \(R\) and \(r\) and distance \(d\) between their centers is given by:

\[
A = r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r^2 - R^2}{2dr}\right) + R^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + R^2 - r^2}{2dR}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R)}
\]

In our case, \(R = 2\), \(r = 1\), and \(d = 1\). Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

\[
A = 1^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1^2 + 1^2 - 2^2}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 1}\right) + 2^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1^2 + 2^2 - 1^2}{2 \cdot 1 \cdot 2}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-1 + 1 + 2)(1 + 1 - 2)(1 - 1 + 2)(1 + 1 + 2)}
\]

Simplifying inside the inverse cosine functions and the square root, we get:

\[
A = \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1 + 1 - 4}{2}\right) + 4 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1 + 4 - 1}{4}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(2)(0)(2)(4)} = \cos^{-1}(-1) + 4 \cos^{-1}(1) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{0}
\]

Since \(\cos^{-1}(-1) = \pi\) and \(\cos^{-1}(1) = 0\), the equation simplifies to:

\[
A = \pi + 4 \cdot 0 - 0 = \pi - \pi \cos \theta + 4 \pi \cos^2 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{4 \sin^2 \theta} = \pi - \pi \cos \theta + 4 \pi \cos^2 \left(\frac{\theta}{2}\right) - 2 \sin \theta
\]

However, the correct formula for the area of the intersection of two circles with radii \(R\) and \(r\) and distance \(d\) between their centers is:

\[
A = r^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + r^2 - R^2}{2dr}\right) + R^2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{d^2 + R^2 - r^2}{2dR}\right) - \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{(-d + r + R)(d + r - R)(d - r + R)(d + r + R)}

The correct formula is:

\[
A = 2 \cos^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

The area of the region where the circles overlap is \(\frac{5\pi}{3}\). Therefore, we need to find the angle \(\theta\) such that:

\[
\frac{5\pi}{3} = \frac{2\pi}{3} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}

"To determine how many cylindrical mottas are needed to fill a spherical tank, we need to calculate the volume of both the cylinder and the sphere and then find the ratio of the volume of the sphere to the volume of the cylinder.

First, let's calculate the volume of the cylindrical mott. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi r^2 h \]
where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. For the cylindrical mott, the radius \( r \) is 3 cm and the height \( h \) is 8 cm. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ V_{\text{cylinder}} = \pi (3)^2 (8) = \pi \cdot 9 \cdot 8 = 72\pi \, \text{cm}^3 \]

Next, let's calculate the volume of the spherical tank. The formula for the volume of a sphere is:
\[ V_{\text{sphere}} = \frac{4}{3} \pi r^3 \]
where \( r \) is the radius. For the spherical tank, the radius \( r \) is 6 cm. Substituting this value into the formula, we get:

"To solve the expression \(\sin (\arcsin 0.4 + \arcsin 0.5) \cdot \sin (\arcsin 0.5 - \arcsin 0.4)\), we start by letting \(\alpha = \arcsin 0.4\) and \(\beta = \arcsin 0.5\). This means that \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\). We need to find \(\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha)\).

Using the sine addition and subtraction formulas, we have:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) = \sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]
\[
\sin (\beta - \alpha) = \sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta
\]

Substituting these into the original expression, we get:
\[
\sin (\alpha + \beta) \cdot \sin (\beta - \alpha) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta)
\]

This is a difference of squares, so we can simplify it as:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta + \cos \alpha \sin \beta)(\sin \beta \cos \alpha - \cos \alpha \sin \beta) = (\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2
\]

Next, we substitute \(\sin \alpha = 0.4\) and \(\sin \beta = 0.5\) into the expression. To find \(\cos \alpha\) and \(\cos \beta\), we use the Pythagorean identity \(\cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1\):
\[
\cos \alpha = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \alpha} = \sqrt{1 - 0.4^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.16} = \sqrt{0.84} = \sqrt{\frac{21}{25}} = \frac{\sqrt{21}}{5}

\[
\cos \beta = \sqrt{1 - \sin^2 \beta} = \sqrt{1 - 0.5^2} = \sqrt{1 - 0.25} = \sqrt{0.75} = \sqrt{\frac{3}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}
\]

Now we substitute \(\sin \alpha\), \(\cos \alpha\), \(\sin \beta\), and \(\cos \beta\) into the expression:
\[
(\sin \alpha \cos \beta)^2 - (\cos \alpha \sin \beta)^2 = \left(0.4 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{\sqrt{21}}{5} \cdot 0.5\right)^2

\[
= \left(\frac{0.4 \sqrt{3}}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{0.5 \sqrt{21}}{5}\right)^2

\[

First, calculate the total number of ways to form a 5-member committee from 14 people (8 republicans and 6 Democrats):
\[

Next, calculate the number of ways to form a 5-member committee that consists only of republicans. This is the number of ways to choose 5 republicans from 8:
\[
\binom{8}{5} = \frac{8!}{5!(8-5)!} = \frac{8!}{5! \cdot 3!} = 56

This simplifies to:

Next, we recognize that the left side of the equation is a perfect square. Specifically, \(x^2 - 4x + 4\) can be rewritten as \((x-2)^2\). So the equation becomes:

\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

Next, we use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression. Specifically, we use the identity:

\[
\prod_{k=0}^{n-1} \cos \left( \frac{2k\pi}{2n+1} \right) = \frac{1}{2^n}.
\]

In our case, we can rewrite the product in terms of the roots of the polynomial \(P(x) = 2^{15} x^{15} - 1\). The roots of this polynomial are the 15th roots of unity, which are \(e^{2k\pi i / 15}\) for \(k = 0, 1, 2, \ldots, 14\). The polynomial can be factored as:

\[
P(x) = 2^{15} (x-1)(x-\omega)(x-\omega^2) \cdots (x-\omega^{14}),
\]

where \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 15}\) is a primitive 15th root of unity. The product of the cosines of the angles \(\frac{2\pi}{15}, \frac{4\pi}{15}, \ldots, \frac{14\pi}{15}\) is the real part of the product of the roots \(\omega, \omega^2, \ldots, \omega^{14}\) divided by \(2^{15}\). Since the product of all 15th roots of unity is 1, we have:

\[
\omega \cdot \omega^2 \cdot \ldots \cdot \omega^{14} = \omega^{1+2+\cdots+14} = \omega^{105} = (\omega^{15})^7 = 1^7 = 1.
\]

Therefore, the product of the cosines is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cdots \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^{14}} = \frac{1}{16384}.
\]

However, we need to find the value of the original expression, which is:

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8 \pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14 \pi}{15} \right).
\]

We can use the identity for the product of cosines of angles that are in arithmetic progression again, but this time for \(n = 4\) and \(2n+1 = 15\):

\[
\cos \left( \frac{2\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{4\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{8\pi}{15} \right) \cos \left( \frac{14\pi}{15} \right) = \frac{1}{2^4} = \frac{1}{16}.
\]

Thus, the value of the expression is:

"Given an isosceles triangle \(ABC\) with \(AB = AC\) and altitude \(AM = 11\), we know that \(M\) is the midpoint of \(BC\). Let \(BM = MC = x\). Therefore, \(BC = 2x\).

Since \(D\) is on \(AM\) such that \(AD = 10\), it follows that \(DM = AM - AD = 11 - 10 = 1\).

We are given that \(\angle BDC = 3\angle BAC\). Let \(\angle BAC = \theta\). Then \(\angle BDC = 3\theta\).

In triangle \(BDC\), we can use the Law of Cosines to express \(BD^2\) and \(CD^2\):
\[BD^2 = BM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot BM \cdot DM \cdot \cos(\angle BDC) = x^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot 1 \cdot \cos(3\theta) = x^2 + 1 - 2x \cos(3\theta),\]
\[CD^2 = CM^2 + DM^2 - 2 \cdot CM \cdot DM \cdot \cos(\angle BDC) = x^2 + 1^2 - 2 \cdot x \cdot 1 \cdot \cos(3\theta) = x^2 + 1 - 2x \cos(3\theta).\]
Thus, \(BD = CD = \sqrt{x^2 + 1 - 2x \cos(3\theta)}\).

In triangle \(ABD\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(AB\):
\[AB^2 = AD^2 + BD^2 = 10^2 + (x^2 + 1 - 2x \cos(3\theta)) = 100 + x^2 + 1 - 2x \cos(3\theta) = x^2 + 101 - 2x \cos(3\theta).\]
Since \(AB = AC\), we have \(AC^2 = x^2 + 101 - 2x \cos(3\theta)\).

In triangle \(AMC\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(AC\):
\[AC^2 = AM^2 + MC^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.\]
Equating the two expressions for \(AC^2\), we get:
\[x^2 + 101 - 2x \cos(3\theta) = 121 + x^2.\]
Subtracting \(x^2\) from both sides, we obtain:
\[101 - 2x \cos(3\theta) = 121.\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[-2x \cos(3\theta) = 20,\]
\[\cos(3\theta) = -\frac{10}{x}.\]

We know from trigonometric identities that \(\cos(3\theta) = 4\cos^3(\theta) - 3\cos(\theta)\). Let \(\cos(\theta) = y\). Then:
\[4y^3 - 3y = -\frac{10}{x}.\]

In triangle \(ABM\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find \(AB\):
\[AB^2 = AM^2 + BM^2 = 11^2 + x^2 = 121 + x^2.\]
Since \(AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 101 - 2x \cos(3\theta)}\), we substitute \(\cos(3\theta) = -\frac{10}{x}\):
\[AB^2 = x^2 + 101 - 2x \left(-\frac{10}{x}\right) = x^2 + 101 + 20 = x^2 + 121.\]
Thus, \(AB = \sqrt{x^2 + 121}\).

The perimeter of triangle \(ABC\) is:
\[AB + AC + BC = \sqrt{x^2 + 121} + \sqrt{x^2 + 121} + 2x = 2\sqrt{x^2 + 121} + 2x.\]

We need to find \(x\). From the equation \(4y^3 - 3y = -\frac{10}{x}\), we need to find a value of \(y\) that satisfies this equation. By trial and error or using numerical methods, we find that \(y = \frac{1}{2}\) is a solution. Therefore:
\[4\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 - 3\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = 4 \cdot \frac{1}{8} - \frac{3}{2} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{2} = -1.\]
Thus, \(-\frac{10}{x} = -1\), so \(x = 10\).

Substituting \(x = 10\) into the expression for the perimeter, we get:
\[2\sqrt{10^2 + 121} + 2 \cdot 10 = 2\sqrt{100 + 121} + 20 = 2\sqrt{221} + 20.\]

"To find the median of 27 consecutive positive integers whose sum is \(3^7\), we start by letting the first integer in the sequence be \(a\). The sequence of integers can then be written as \(a, a+1, a+2, \ldots, a+26\).

The sum of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[
\text{Sum} = \text{number of terms} \times \text{average of the terms}
\]
In this case, the number of terms is 27, and the average of the terms is the average of the first and last terms, which is:
\[
\text{average} = \frac{a + (a + 26)}{2} = \frac{2a + 26}{2} = a + 13
\]
Therefore, the sum of the sequence is:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 3^7
\]
We know that \(3^7 = 2187\), so we can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
27 \times (a + 13) = 2187
\]
To find \(a\), we divide both sides of the equation by 27:
\[
a + 13 = \frac{2187}{27} = 81
\]
Subtracting 13 from both sides, we get:
\[
a = 81 - 13 = 68
\]
The sequence of integers is therefore \(68, 69, 70, \ldots, 94\). The median of a sequence of 27 consecutive integers is the 14th term in the sequence. The 14th term is:
\[
a + 13 = 68 + 13 = 81

Thus, the median of the sequence is:

"To solve the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) for real numbers \(x\), we will break it down into two separate inequalities and solve each one step by step.

### Step 1: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\)

First, observe that \(x^4\) and \(4x^2\) are both non-negative for all real numbers \(x\) (since they are even powers of \(x\)). Therefore, \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\).

Since \(x^4 + 4x^2 \geq 0\) and \(-4 < 0\), the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 > -4\) is always true for all real numbers \(x\).

### Step 2: Solve \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\)

Next, we need to solve the inequality \(x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\). To do this, we can make a substitution to simplify the expression. Let \(y = x^2\). Then the inequality becomes:

\[
y^2 + 4y < 21
\]

Rearrange this into a standard quadratic inequality form:

\[
y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0
\]

Now, we solve the quadratic equation \(y^2 + 4y - 21 = 0\) to find the critical points. We can factorize the quadratic expression:

\[
y^2 + 4y - 21 = (y + 7)(y - 3) = 0
\]

Setting each factor equal to zero gives us the solutions:

\[
y + 7 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = -7
\]
\[
y - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 3
\]

Since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2\) is always non-negative, we discard \(y = -7\) because it is not in the domain of \(y\). Therefore, we only consider \(y = 3\).

The quadratic inequality \(y^2 + 4y - 21 < 0\) holds between the roots \(y = -7\) and \(y = 3\). However, since \(y = x^2\) and \(x^2 \geq 0\), we only consider the interval:

\[
0 \leq y < 3
\]

Substituting back \(y = x^2\), we get:

\[
0 \leq x^2 < 3
\]

Taking the square root of all parts of the inequality, we obtain:

\[
- \sqrt{3} < x < \sqrt{3}
\]

Combining the results from both steps, we find that the inequality \(-4 < x^4 + 4x^2 < 21\) holds for:

"To find the value of \(xy + yz + zx\), we start by using the given equations and some algebraic identities. The equations are:
\[
xyz = 4,
\]
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4,
\]
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12.
\]

First, recall the identity for the sum of cubes:
\[
x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]
Substituting the given values \(x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 4\) and \(xyz = 4\) into the identity, we get:
\[
4 - 3 \cdot 4 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
4 - 12 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx),
\]
or
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx).
\]

Next, we use another identity to express \(x^2 + y^2 + z^2\) in terms of \(x+y+z\) and \(xy + yz + zx\):
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x+y+z)^2 - 2(xy + yz + zx).
\]
Substituting this into the equation \(-8 = (x+y+z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx)\), we get:
\[
-8 = (x+y+z)((x+y+z)^2 - 3(xy + yz + zx)).
\]

Now, let's denote \(x+y+z\) by \(s\) and \(xy + yz + zx\) by \(p\). The equation becomes:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p).
\]

We also know from the given equation \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) that:
\[
xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = xy(x+y) + xz(x+z) + yz(y+z) = xy(s-z) + xz(s-y) + yz(s-x) = s(xy + xz + yz) - 3xyz = sp - 3 \cdot 4 = sp - 12.
\]
Substituting the given value \(xy^2 + x^2 y + xz^2 + x^2 z + yz^2 + y^2 z = 12\) into this equation, we get:
\[
sp - 12 = 12,
\]
which simplifies to:
\[
sp = 24.
\]

Now we have two equations:
\[
-8 = s(s^2 - 3p),
\]
\[
sp = 24.
\]
Substituting \(p = \frac{24}{s}\) into the first equation, we get:
\[
-8 = s\left(s^2 - 3 \cdot \frac{24}{s}\right) = s\left(s^2 - \frac{72}{s}\right) = s^3 - 72.
\]
Rearranging terms, we get:
\[
s^3 = 64,
\]
so
\[
s = 4.
\]

Now substituting \(s = 4\) back into the equation \(sp = 24\), we get:
\[
4p = 24,
\]
so
\[
p = 6.

Therefore, the value of \(xy + yz + zx\) is \(\boxed{6}\).","[6, '6']",6,"[6, '6']",True
"To determine in which luokka-aste miesten bussimatka-ajien määrä is closest to \(135\%\) of naister bussimatka-ajien määrä, we need to calculate the ratio of the number of miesten to the number of naister for each luokka-ase and compare it to \(1.35\).

First, let's calculate the number of miesten and naister in each luokka-ase. Since there are 300 miesten and 300 naister in total for each luokka-ase, we can use the given percentages to find the actual number of miesten and naister in each luokka-ase.

For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) luokka:
- Number of miesten: \(300 \times 0.411 = 123.3 \approx 123\)
- Number of naister: \(300 \times 0.394 = 118.2 \approx 118\)
- Ratio of miesten to naister: \(\frac{123}{118} \approx 1.042\)

For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) luokka:
- Number of miesten: \(300 \times 0.344 = 103.2 \approx 103\)
- Number of naister: \(300 \times 0.331 = 99.3 \approx 99\)
- Ratio of miesten to naister: \(\frac{103}{99} \approx 1.040\)

For the \(11^{\text{th}}\) luokka:
- Number of miesten: \(300 \times 0.206 = 61.8 \approx 62\)
- Number of naister: \(300 \times 0.138 = 41.4 \approx 41\)
- Ratio of miesten to naister: \(\frac{62}{41} \approx 1.512\)

For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) luokka:
- Number of miesten: \(300 \times 0.116 = 34.8 \approx 35\)
- Number of naister: \(300 \times 0.086 = 25.8 \approx 26\)
- Ratio of miesten to naister: \(\frac{35}{26} \approx 1.346\)

Now, we compare each ratio to \(1.35\):
- For the \(9^{\text{th}}\) luokka: \(1.042\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.042 = 0.308\))
- For the \(10^{\text{th}}\) luokka: \(1.040\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.040 = 0.310\))

- For the \(12^{\text{th}}\) luokka: \(1.346\) (difference: \(1.35 - 1.346 = 0.004\))

The smallest difference is \(0.004\), which corresponds to the \(12^{\text{th}}\) luokka. Therefore, the luokka-ase where the number of miesten bussimatka-ajien määrä is closest to \(135\%\) of naister bussimatka-ajien määrä is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To solve the inequality \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x} < 0\), we need to analyze the numerator and the denominator separately and then determine where their quotient is negative.

First, let's rewrite the numerator \(|x^2 - 81|\). The expression inside the absolute value can be factored as a difference of squares:
\[x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9).\]
Therefore, the numerator becomes:
\[|x^2 - 81| = |(x - 9)(x + 9)|.\]
The absolute value function \(|(x - 9)(x + 9)|\) can be expressed as:
\[|(x - 9)(x + 9)| = \begin{cases} 
(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } x \leq -9 \text{ or } x \geq 9, \\
-(x - 9)(x + 9) & \text{if } -9 < x < 9.
\end{cases}\]

Next, let's factor the denominator \(x^2 - 36x\):
\[x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36).\]
The denominator is zero when \(x = 0\) or \(x = 36\), so these values are excluded from the domain of the function.

Now, we need to consider the sign of the expression \(\frac{|x^2 - 81|}{x^2 - 36x}\) in the intervals determined by the critical points \(x = -9\), \(x = 0\), and \(x = 9\). These intervals are \((-\infty, -9)\), \((-9, 0)\), \((0, 9)\), and \((9, 36)\), and \((36, \infty)\).

1. For \(x \in (-\infty, -9)\), both \(x \leq -9\) and \(x < 0\), so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x < -9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 < 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

2. For \(x \in (-9, 0)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is true, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(-9 < x < 0\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x < 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

3. For \(x \in (0, 9)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = -(x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{-(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(0 < x < 9\), \(x - 9 < 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

4. For \(x \in (9, 36)\), \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(9 < x < 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 < 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is negative, so the quotient is negative.

5. For \(x \in (36, \infty)\), both \(x \leq -9\) is false and \(x < 0\) is false, so \(|x^2 - 81| = (x - 9)(x + 9)\) and \(x^2 - 36x = x(x - 36)\). The expression becomes:
   \[\frac{(x - 9)(x + 9)}{x(x - 36)}.\]
   Since \(x > 36\), \(x - 9 > 0\), \(x + 9 > 0\), and \(x > 0\), \(x - 36 > 0\). Therefore, the numerator is positive and the denominator is positive, so the quotient is positive.

Combining all the intervals where the quotient is negative, we get:

"To determine the maximum possible area of the rectangle within the given radan, we start by analyzing the given information. The radan is a square with a side length of 400 meters, and it contains a rectangle with two straight sides and two semicircular ends. The total length of the radan's perimeter is 400 meters.

Let's denote the length of the rectangle by \( l \) and the width by \( w \). The two semicircular ends together form a full circle with radius \( \frac{w}{2} \). The circumference of this circle is \( \pi w \). The total length of the perimeter of the radan is the sum of the lengths of the two straight sides and the circumference of the circle:
\[
l + l + \pi w = 2l + \pi w = 400
\]
Solving for \( l \), we get:
\[
2l = 400 - \pi w \implies l = 200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}
\]
The area \( A \) of the rectangle is given by:
\[
A = l \cdot w = \left(200 - \frac{\pi w}{2}\right) w = 200w - \frac{\pi w^2}{2}
\]
To find the maximum area, we take the derivative of \( A \) with respect to \( w \) and set it to zero:
\[
\frac{dA}{dw} = 200 - \pi w = 0
\]
Solving for \( w \), we get:
\[
\pi w = 200 \implies w = \frac{200}{\pi}
\]
Next, we substitute \( w = \frac{200}{\pi} \) back into the equation for \( l \):
\[
l = 200 - \frac{\pi \left(\frac{200}{\pi}\right)}{2} = 200 - \frac{200}{2} = 200 - 100 = 100

Given:
- \(\sin{R} = \frac{2}{5}\)
- \(\triangle RST\) is a right triangle with \(\angle S = 90^\circ\)
- The hypotenuse \(RT = 5\)

First, recall the definition of the sine function in a right triangle:
\[
\sin{\theta} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}
\]

For \(\angle R\):
\[
\sin{R} = \frac{\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}} = \frac{ST}{RT}

\[

\[

\[

"To find the minimum distance from the origin to the point on the curve \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \), we start by expressing the distance \( D \) from the origin \((0,0)\) to a point \((x, y)\) on the curve. The distance formula is given by:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

Substituting \( y = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \) into the distance formula, we get:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(x^2 - 3) \right)^2}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^2 - 3)^2}
\]

Expand \( (x^2 - 3)^2 \):

\[
(x^2 - 3)^2 = x^4 - 6x^2 + 9
\]

Substitute this back into the distance formula:

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 6x^2 + 9)}
\]

Distribute the \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
D = \sqrt{x^2 + \frac{1}{2}x^4 - 3x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Combine like terms:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}x^4 - 2x^2 + \frac{9}{2}}
\]

Factor out \(\frac{1}{2}\) from the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(x^4 - 4x^2 + 9)}
\]

Simplify the expression inside the square root:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{x^4 - 4x^2 + 9}
\]

To minimize \( D \), we need to minimize the expression inside the square root, \( f(x) = x^4 - 4x^2 + 9 \). We do this by finding the critical points of \( f(x) \) by taking its derivative and setting it to zero:

\[
f'(x) = 4x^3 - 8x
\]

Set the derivative equal to zero:

\[
4x^3 - 8x = 0
\]

Factor out \( 4x \):

\[
4x(x^2 - 2) = 0
\]

Solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x^2 = 2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{2}
\]

We evaluate \( f(x) \) at these critical points:

1. For \( x = 0 \):

\[
f(0) = 0^4 - 4(0)^2 + 9 = 9
\]

2. For \( x = \sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(\sqrt{2}) = (\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

3. For \( x = -\sqrt{2} \):

\[
f(-\sqrt{2}) = (-\sqrt{2})^4 - 4(-\sqrt{2})^2 + 9 = 4 - 8 + 9 = 5
\]

The minimum value of \( f(x) \) is 5. Therefore, the minimum distance \( D \) is:

\[
D = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sqrt{5} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{\sqrt{2}} = \frac{\sqrt{10}}{2}
\]

Thus, \( a = 10 \) and \( b = 2 \). The sum \( a + b \) is:

\[
a + b = 10 + 2 = 12
\]

"To find \( f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) \), we need to determine the values of \( x \) such that \( f(x) = 0 \) and \( f(x) = 6 \), and then sum these values.

First, let's find \( f^{-1}(0) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 0 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 0 \):
\[ 3 - x = 0 \]
\[ x = 3 \]
Since \( x = 3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(0) = 3 \).

Next, let's find \( f^{-1}(6) \). This means we need to solve \( f(x) = 6 \).

For \( x \leq 3 \):
\[ f(x) = 3 - x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ 3 - x = 6 \]
\[ x = -3 \]
Since \( x = -3 \) satisfies \( x \leq 3 \), \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

For \( x > 3 \):
\[ f(x) = -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x \]
Setting \( f(x) = 6 \):
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x = 6 \]
\[ -x^3 + 2x^2 + 3x - 6 = 0 \]
We can use the Rational Root Theorem to test possible rational roots. The possible rational roots are \( \pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \pm 6 \). Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = -1 \):
\[ -(-1)^3 + 2(-1)^2 + 3(-1) - 6 = 1 + 2 - 3 - 6 = -6 \]
So, \( x = -1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -2 \):
\[ -(-2)^3 + 2(-2)^2 + 3(-2) - 6 = 8 + 8 - 6 - 6 = 4 \]
So, \( x = -2 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -3 \):
\[ -(-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 + 3(-3) - 6 = 27 + 18 - 9 - 6 = 24 \]
So, \( x = -3 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 6 \):
\[ -(6)^3 + 2(6)^2 + 3(6) - 6 = -216 + 72 + 18 - 6 = -132 \]
So, \( x = 6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = -6 \):
\[ -(-6)^3 + 2(-6)^2 + 3(-6) - 6 = 216 + 72 - 18 - 6 = 264 \]
So, \( x = -6 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 1 \):
\[ -(1)^3 + 2(1)^2 + 3(1) - 6 = -1 + 2 + 3 - 6 = -2 \]
So, \( x = 1 \) is not a root. Let's test \( x = 2 \):
\[ -(2)^3 + 2(2)^2 + 3(2) - 6 = -8 + 8 + 6 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 2 \) is a root. However, \( x = 2 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \). Let's test \( x = 3 \):
\[ -(3)^3 + 2(3)^2 + 3(3) - 6 = -27 + 18 + 9 - 6 = 0 \]
So, \( x = 3 \) is a root. However, \( x = 3 \) does not satisfy \( x > 3 \).

Therefore, there is no solution for \( x > 3 \).

Thus, the only solution is \( f^{-1}(6) = -3 \).

Finally, we sum \( f^{-1}(0) \) and \( f^{-1}(6) \):
\[ f^{-1}(0) + f^{-1}(6) = 3 + (-3) = 0 \]

"To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance from point \( P \) to the two remaining vertices of the regular octahedron, given the distances from \( P \) to the other five vertices. The vertices of a regular octahedron can be represented in a coordinate system such that the center of the octahedron is at the origin \((0,0,0)\), and the vertices are at \((\pm 1, 0, 0)\), \((0, \pm 1, 0)\), and \((0, 0, \pm 1)\).

Let's denote the coordinates of point \( P \) as \((x, y, z)\). The distances from \( P \) to the vertices are given by the Euclidean distance formula:
\[
\sqrt{(x \pm 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + (y \pm 1)^2 + z^2} = 7, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z \pm 1)^2} = 8, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 9, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 11.
\]
However, the last two equations are identical, so we only have four unique distances:
\[
\sqrt{(x \pm 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 3, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + (y \pm 1)^2 + z^2} = 7, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z \pm 1)^2} = 8, \quad \sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} = 9.
\]
We can square these equations to eliminate the square roots:
\[
(x \pm 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 9, \quad x^2 + (y \pm 1)^2 + z^2 = 49, \quad x^2 + y^2 + (z \pm 1)^2 = 64, \quad x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 81.
\]
From the fourth equation, we know:
\[
x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 81.
\]
Substituting \( x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 81 \) into the other equations, we get:
\[
(x \pm 1)^2 + y^2 + z^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 \pm 2x + 1 = 81 \pm 2x + 1 = 9 \implies \pm 2x + 82 = 9 \implies \pm 2x = 9 - 82 = -73 \implies x = \pm \frac{73}{2}.
\]
This is not possible since \( x \) must be a real number and \( \frac{73}{2} \) is not a valid solution. Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem by considering the correct distances and their relationships.

Given the symmetry of the octahedron, we can use the fact that the sum of the squares of the distances from any point inside a regular octahedron to its vertices is constant. The sum of the squares of the distances from \( P \) to the vertices is:
\[
3^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 + 9^2 + 11^2 + d^2 = 2 \times (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2 \times (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) + 2 \times (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) = 6 \times 81 = 486.
\]
Therefore, we have:
\[
9 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 121 + d^2 = 486 \implies 324 + d^2 = 486 \implies d^2 = 162 \implies d = \sqrt{162} = 9\sqrt{2}.
\]
Thus, the distance from point \( P \) to the two remaining vertices is:
\[

"To determine the ratio of Jen's palon kiihtyvyyden to Jack's palon kiihtyvyyden, we start by using Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force (voime) is equal to the mass times the acceleration (kiihtyvyy). Mathematically, this is expressed as:

\[ F = m \cdot a \]

Given that Jen heittää pehmeän pallon with the same force as Jack heittää baseball-pallon, we can set the forces equal to each other:

\[ F_{\text{Jen}} = F_{\text{Jack}} \]

This means:

\[ m_{\text{Jen}} \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = m_{\text{Jack}} \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

We are given the masses of the pehmeän pallon and the baseball-pallon:
\[ m_{\text{Jen}} = 200 \text{ g} \]
\[ m_{\text{Jack}} = 150 \text{ g} \]

Substituting these values into the equation, we get:

\[ 200 \cdot a_{\text{Jen}} = 150 \cdot a_{\text{Jack}} \]

To find the ratio of Jen's kiihtyvyyden to Jack's kiihtyvyyden, we solve for \( \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} \):

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{150}{200} \]

Simplifying the fraction, we get:

\[ \frac{a_{\text{Jen}}}{a_{\text{Jack}}} = \frac{3}{4} \]

Therefore, the ratio of Jen's palon kiihtyvyyden to Jack's palon kiihtyvyyden is:

"To determine how many same digits appear in the base 7 and base 8 representations of the decimal number \(629_{10}\), we first need to convert \(629_{10}\) to both base 7 and base 8.

**Step 1: Convert \(629_{10}\) to base 7.**

We repeatedly divide 629 by 7 and keep track of the remainders:
\[
629 \div 7 = 89 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 6
\]
\[
89 \div 7 = 12 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 5

\[

\[

Reading the remainders from bottom to top, we get the base 8 representation:
\[

**Step 3: Identify the common digits in \(1556_7\) and \(1165_8\).**

The base 7 representation is \(1556_7\) and the base 8 representation is \(1165_8\). We compare the digits:
- \(1556_7\) has the digits 1, 5, 5, 6.
- \(1165_8\) has the digits 1, 1, 6, 5.

The common digits are 1, 5, and 6. Each of these digits appears exactly once in both representations.

**Step 4: Count the number of common digits.**

"To determine the number of ways Kuuri noitaa and ten veloes can be paired up, we need to consider the following:

1. Each noitaa can pair with any of the ten veloes.
2. Once a noitaa has paired with a veloe, that veloe is no longer available for any other noitaa.
3. The process continues until all noitaa have paired with a veloe.

This problem can be solved using the concept of permutations. Specifically, we are looking for the number of ways to arrange 10 veloes to pair with 10 noitaa. This is given by the factorial of 10, denoted as \(10!\).

The factorial of a number \(n\) is the product of all positive integers up to \(n\). Therefore, we calculate \(10!\) as follows:

\[
10! = 10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 \times 6 \times 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1

The polynomial \( f(x) \) is given by:
\[ f(x) = 3x^4 + 5x^2 - 9x - 2. \]

Substituting \( x-1 \) for \( x \), we get:

where \((x_1, y_1)\) is the point, and \(Ax + By + C = 0\) is the equation of the line. First, we need to rewrite the equation of the line \(y = 2x - 2\) in the standard form \(Ax + By + C = 0\).

Starting with \(y = 2x - 2\), we can rearrange it as:

Here, \(A = 2\), \(B = -1\), and \(C = -2\). The point \((x_1, y_1)\) is \((6, 0)\). Now, we substitute these values into the distance formula:

Vieta's formulas tell us that for the polynomial \(x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0\), the sums and products of the roots are given by:

Next, we consider the product \(S_1 S_2 S_3\). We can express \(S_1 S_2 S_3\) in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials:

This can be rewritten using the fact that \(\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4 = 2\):

\[
S_1 S_2 S_3 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2\alpha_3\alpha_4)^2 = 2^2 = 4.
\]

Now, we know that \(S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 0\) and \(S_1 S_2 S_3 = 4\). The numbers \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\) are the roots of the polynomial \(t^3 - (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)t^2 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - S_1 S_2 S_3 = 0\), which simplifies to:

\[
t^3 + (S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)t - 4 = 0.
\]

We also know from Vieta's formulas that:

\[
S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = (\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4) + (\alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4)(\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3) + (\alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3)(\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4).

S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) + 2 \cdot 2 \cdot (-2) = (\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) - 8.
\]

Since \(S_1^2 + S_2^2 + S_3^2 = (S_1 + S_2 + S_3)^2 - 2(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1) = 0 - 2(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1) = -2(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1)\), we have:

\[
-2(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1) = (\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2) - 8.
\]

Substituting \(\alpha_1^2\alpha_2^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_1^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_3^2 + \alpha_2^2\alpha_4^2 + \alpha_3^2\alpha_4^2 = S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 + 4\) into the equation, we get:

\[
-2(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1) = S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 + 4 - 8 = S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 - 4.
\]

Solving for \(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1\), we get:

\[
-3(S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1) = -4 \implies S_1 S_2 + S_2 S_3 + S_3 S_1 = \frac{4}{3}.
\]

Therefore, the polynomial \(t^3 + \frac{4}{3}t - 4 = 0\) has roots \(S_1\), \(S_2\), and \(S_3\). By inspection or using numerical methods, we find that the roots are \(2\), \(-1 + i\), and \(-1 - i\). Thus, the set \(\{\alpha_1\alpha_2 + \alpha_3\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_3 + \alpha_2\alpha_4, \alpha_1\alpha_4 + \alpha_2\alpha_3\}\) is:

"Let's define the cost of one kynä as \( k \) dollars and the cost of one järkokoin as \( j \) dollars. We are given two equations based on the information provided:

1. Three kynää and one järkokoin cost \$1.24:
   \[
   3k + j = 1.24
   \]

2. Five kynää and one järkokoin cost \$1.82:
   \[
   5k + j = 1.82
   \]

To find the cost of one kynä, we can subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate \( j \):

\[
(5k + j) - (3k + j) = 1.82 - 1.24
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:

\[
5k + j - 3k - j = 2k

So the equation becomes:

\[
2k = 0.58

To solve for \( k \), we divide both sides by 2:

"To determine the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle \(ABCD\) is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices, we need to analyze the geometric regions within the rectangle where this condition holds.

First, let's place the rectangle \(ABCD\) in the coordinate plane with \(O\) at the origin \((0,0)\). Assume the coordinates of the vertices are:
- \(A = (-a, b)\)
- \(B = (a, b)\)
- \(C = (a, -b)\)
- \(D = (-a, -b)\)

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to the center \(O\) is given by:
\[
d_O = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}
\]

The distance from a point \((x, y)\) to a vertex, say \(A = (-a, b)\), is:
\[
d_A = \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

We need to find the region where \(d_O < d_A\). Setting up the inequality:
\[
\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}
\]

Squaring both sides to eliminate the square roots:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2
\]

Expanding the right-hand side:
\[
x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Subtracting \(x^2 + y^2\) from both sides:
\[
0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2
\]

Rearranging terms:
\[
2ax - 2by < -(a^2 + b^2)
\]

Dividing by 2:
\[
ax - by < -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]

This inequality represents a line in the coordinate plane. Similarly, we can find the inequalities for the other vertices:
1. \(d_O < d_B\): \(ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
2. \(d_O < d_C\): \(-ax + by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)
3. \(d_O < d_D\): \(-ax - by < \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\)

These four inequalities define four regions in the rectangle. The region where \(d_O < d_A, d_B, d_C,\) and \(d_D\) is the intersection of these four regions. This intersection forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with side lengths proportional to \(a\) and \(b\).

The side lengths of this smaller rectangle can be found by solving the inequalities for the points where the lines intersect the sides of the original rectangle. For example, solving \(ax - by = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\) for \(x\) when \(y = b\):
\[
ax - b^2 = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
ax = b^2 - \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
ax = \frac{2b^2 - a^2 - b^2}{2}
\]
\[
ax = \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2a}
\]

Similarly, solving for \(x\) when \(y = -b\):
\[
ax + b^2 = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}
\]
\[
ax = -\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2} - b^2
\]
\[
ax = -\frac{a^2 + b^2 + 2b^2}{2}
\]
\[
ax = -\frac{a^2 + 3b^2}{2}
\]
\[
x = -\frac{a^2 + 3b^2}{2a}
\]

The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are:
\[
\text{Length} = \left| \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2a} - \left( -\frac{a^2 + 3b^2}{2a} \right) \right| = \left| \frac{b^2 - a^2 + a^2 + 3b^2}{2a} \right| = \left| \frac{4b^2}{2a} \right| = \frac{2b^2}{a}
\]

\[
\text{Width} = \left| \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2b} - \left( -\frac{b^2 - a^2}{2b} \right) \right| = \left| \frac{b^2 - a^2 + b^2 - a^2}{2b} \right| = \left| \frac{2b^2 - 2a^2}{2b} \right| = \left| \frac{b^2 - a^2}{b} \right| = \frac{b^2 - a^2}{b}
\]

The area of the smaller rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{small}} = \frac{2b^2}{a} \cdot \frac{b^2 - a^2}{b} = \frac{2b^2(b^2 - a^2)}{ab} = \frac{2b(b^2 - a^2)}{a}
\]

The area of the original rectangle is:
\[
\text{Area}_{\text{original}} = 2a \cdot 2b = 4ab
\]

The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Area}_{\text{small}}}{\text{Area}_{\text{original}}} = \frac{\frac{2b(b^2 - a^2)}{a}}{4ab} = \frac{2b(b^2 - a^2)}{4a^2b} = \frac{b^2 - a^2}{2a^2}
\]

Given \(AB/AD = k\), we have:
\[
\frac{2b}{2a} = k \implies \frac{b}{a} = k \implies b = ka
\]

Substituting \(b = ka\) into the probability expression:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{(ka)^2 - a^2}{2a^2} = \frac{k^2a^2 - a^2}{2a^2} = \frac{a^2(k^2 - 1)}{2a^2} = \frac{k^2 - 1}{2}
\]

Thus, the probability that a randomly chosen point inside the rectangle is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the four vertices is:

"To determine the remainder when 54 is divided by 6, we can use the division algorithm. The division algorithm states that for any integers \(a\) and \(b\) (with \(b > 0\)), there exist unique integers \(q\) (the quotient) and \(r\) (the remainder) such that:

\[a = bq + r\]

where \(0 \leq r < b\).

In this problem, \(a = 54\) and \(b = 6\). We need to find \(q\) and \(r\) such that:

\[54 = 6q + r\]

and \(0 \leq r < 6\).

First, we perform the division of 54 by 6:

\[54 \div 6 = 9\]

This tells us that the quotient \(q\) is 9. Now, we substitute \(q = 9\) back into the equation to find \(r\):

\[54 = 6 \cdot 9 + r\]
\[54 = 54 + r\]
\[r = 54 - 54\]
\[r = 0\]

"To find the value of \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) \), we need to evaluate each function \( f(n) \) separately based on the given piecewise definition.

First, let's evaluate \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) \):
- The value of \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) is approximately 1.047.
- Since \( \frac{\pi}{3} < 4 \), we use the second case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lceil n \rceil \).
- Therefore, \( f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) = \lceil 1.047 \rceil = 2 \).

Next, let's evaluate \( f(\sqrt{45}) \):
- The value of \( \sqrt{45} \) is approximately 6.708.
- Since \( \sqrt{45} \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(\sqrt{45}) = \lfloor 6.708 \rfloor = 6 \).

Finally, let's evaluate \( f(8^{2/3}) \):
- The value of \( 8^{2/3} \) is the same as \( (2^3)^{2/3} = 2^2 = 4 \).
- Since \( 8^{2/3} = 4 \geq 4 \), we use the first case of the piecewise function: \( f(n) = \lfloor n \rfloor \).
- Therefore, \( f(8^{2/3}) = \lfloor 4 \rfloor = 4 \).

Now, we sum the results of the three evaluations:
\[ f\left(\frac{\pi}{3}\right) + f(\sqrt{45}) + f(8^{2/3}) = 2 + 6 + 4 = 12. \]

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{12}\).","[12, '12']",12,"[12, '12']",True
"To determine how much money Linda, Sherry, June, and Connie have left afterai their cookies and converting the remaining money into coins to set them into the bank, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money they initially have.
2. Determine how many whole dollars they have.
3. Convert the remaining money into coins and set them into the bank.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money they initially have.**

Linda's contribution: \$27.47
Sherry's contribution: \$35.23
June's contribution: \$37.37
 Connie's contribution: \$26.52

Adding these amounts together:
\[ 27.47 + 35.23 + 37.37 + 26.52 = 126.60 \]

So, the total amount of money they have is \$126.60.

**Step 2: Determine how many whole dollars they have.**

The whole dollar part of \$126.60 is \$126.

**Step 3: Convert the remaining money into coins and set them into the bank.**

The remaining money after taking out the whole dollars is:
\[ 126.60 - 126 = 0.60 \]

This remaining money is 60 cents, which is equivalent to 6 dimes. Since they are set into the bank in sets of 5 dimes (which is equivalent to 50 cents), they can set:

"To solve for \( n \) in the given grid, we need to ensure that the sum of the numbers in each row, each column, and each of the two main diagonals is the same. Let's denote this common sum by \( S \).

First, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the first row:
\[
(n-3) + 3 + (n+1) = n - 3 + 3 + n + 1 = 2n + 1
\]
So, \( S = 2n + 1 \).

Next, let's calculate the sum of the numbers in the second row:
\[
(n+2) + (2n-9) + 1 = n + 2 + 2n - 9 + 1 = 3n - 6
\]
Since this sum must also be equal to \( S \), we have:
\[
3n - 6 = 2n + 1
\]
Solving for \( n \), we subtract \( 2n \) from both sides:
\[
n - 6 = 1
\]
Then, we add 6 to both sides:
\[
n = 7
\]

To verify, let's check the sum of the numbers in the third row:
\[

\]
The sum of the numbers in the first column is:
\[
(n-3) + (n+2) + 2 = (7-3) + (7+2) + 2 = 4 + 9 + 2 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the second column is:
\[

The sum of the numbers in the third column is:
\[
(n+1) + 1 + (n-1) = (7+1) + 1 + (7-1) = 8 + 1 + 6 = 15
\]
The sum of the numbers in the main diagonal from the top left to the bottom right is:
\[
(n-3) + (2n-9) + (n-1) = (7-3) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + (7-1) = 4 + 5 + 6 = 15

The sum of the numbers in the other diagonal from the top right to the bottom left is:
\[
(n+1) + (2n-9) + 2 = (7+1) + (2 \cdot 7 - 9) + 2 = 8 + 5 + 2 = 15

"To determine how many fewer feet Jim*kvelee than Martha, we need to calculate the distance each of them travels and then find the difference.

First, let's calculate the distance Jim travels. Jim kuvlee the diagonal of the rectangular field. The formula for the diagonal \(d\) of a rectangle with length \(l\) and width \(w\) is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
\[ d = \sqrt{l^2 + w^2} \]
Here, the length \(l\) is 400 feet and the width \(w\) is 300 feet. Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
\[ d = \sqrt{400^2 + 300^2} = \sqrt{160000 + 90000} = \sqrt{250000} = 500 \text{ feet} \]
So, Jim travels 500 feet.

\[ \text{Distance} = l + w = 400 + 300 = 700 \text{ feet} \]
So, Martha travels 700 feet.

Now, we find the difference in the distances traveled by Jim and Martha:

"Given that \(\omega\) is a complex number such that \(\omega^3 = 1\), we know that \(\omega\) is a primitive cube root of unity. The primitive cube roots of unity are \(\omega = e^{2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} + \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\) and \(\omega^2 = e^{-2\pi i / 3} = -\frac{1}{2} - \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\). The other root is \(\omega^3 = 1\).

We need to find the value of the expression \(\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2}\).

First, let's find a common denominator for the fractions:
\[
\frac{1}{1 + \omega} + \frac{1}{1 + \omega^2} = \frac{(1 + \omega^2) + (1 + \omega)}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)} = \frac{2 + \omega + \omega^2}{(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)}.
\]

We know from the properties of the roots of unity that \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\), so \(\omega + \omega^2 = -1\). Substituting this into the numerator, we get:
\[
2 + \omega + \omega^2 = 2 - 1 = 1.
\]

Next, we need to simplify the denominator \((1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2)\):
\[
(1 + \omega)(1 + \omega^2) = 1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3.
\]
Again, using the property \(\omega + \omega^2 + 1 = 0\) and \(\omega^3 = 1\), we substitute these values in:
\[
1 + \omega + \omega^2 + \omega^3 = 0 + 1 = 1.

So the expression simplifies to:
